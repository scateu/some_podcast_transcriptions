1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Hey I'm Jenna Boomer Robert krulwich Radiolab and today we've got to borrow from more perfect we don't have to buy

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
Going to bathroom or purple

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,976
We will we might as well it is our great pleasure to yes

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
Have more perfect sit on our laps with a tribute to a woman

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Who

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,728
What you said again last couple of months in last 3 months 2 months less too much she's had three broken ribs

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
I had two cancerous nodules removed from her left

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Long

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
But despite some reports to the contrary she's still going

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,992
Mystery predates the documentary the movie by the

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
The way

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,320
And I think it's still really offers

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
And a unique portrait of like

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
How do you actually make change

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
In the world

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,488
Story comes from

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
You search Julie Longoria

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Okay

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
So let me outline the

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
Basic dilemma that's

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,264
At the heart of the story here and I'm going to put it to you as a question bring it

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
If you were to

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
Do a Ctrl F in the Constitution like how many times do you think the words

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
How

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Sex

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
What is one one time in the 19th

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Amendment which

31
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Grants people the right to vote

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
FaceTime

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Really

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,216
Yes that's the only time that's the only time which is crazy cuz we are looking.

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
Is there a sex where that's not sex like gender or something something

36
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Nothing

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Is there like ladies in the condition of women no women have a problem

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
What does that basically we're not in the

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
Except like in this one little spot

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
So when it comes to discriminating against women some people have argued that

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
You

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
There's nothing in the Constitution

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
That says you can't do it

44
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,912
Certainly in the constitution does not require sexual discrimination

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Discrimination on the basis

46
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Sex

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
Constitution doesn't require it it simply doesn't forbid it

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
Fatboy Justice Antonin Scalia

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
It doesn't mean nobody ever voted for that

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,808
Where did you get it from there was nothing it said that I mean not not those words

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
Possibly but there's nothing that says you can't discriminate

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Not on the basis of sex

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
That's legal editor Cristian farias

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,560
We had a 14th amendment that told people that we are

55
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
Equal under the law that everyone is equal protection of the laws

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,984
14th Amendment

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,640
Identify the 15th that's Martha Griffis congresswoman when you think about the history of the Fourteenth Amendment

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
As legal editor Linda Hershman says the 14th amendment was passed in the aftermath of the Civil War

59
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Along with the 13th and 15

60
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,440
13th Amendment abolishing slavery and 15th amendment giving black people

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
Free black men the right to vote

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
If you understand the 14th Amendment to be

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
A part of that Trio of amendments okay it was meant to

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Bring equality to black people

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
When the Fifteenth Amendment have been written which that every citizen could vote

66
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
In the name of Heavens why couldn't women vote

67
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Why don't you why don't you have to have the 19th Amendment

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
Of course the answer why is he didn't consider women people

69
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
There was this basic assumption in the law

70
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
That you know

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Equality for black people is one thing but men and women

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
They're different

73
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
It was

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
The case that the Supreme Court had never once met a distinction between men and women in it

75
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
I didn't like Wendy Williams law professor emeritus at Georgetown

76
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,320
Ridiculous distinction

77
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
The case called Bradwell and it was 1873 or 4

78
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,000
In that case a woman wanted to become

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
A lawyer

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Illinois Bar said and the justices said that that that was a perfectly good rule because

81
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
The justice system

82
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,799
Could be seen as not appropriate for women

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
Now let's jump clear into the next Century here 1948

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Okay it was called gessert versus

85
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Cleary that went to the Supreme Court

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
And the issue was

87
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
Weather women could be bartender

88
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
The court thought that was

89
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Pretty humorous

90
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
That it made sense

91
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
That women could not be bartenders

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
Unless their husbands or fathers

93
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
We're in charge of the bar both of those laws

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Women are not supposed to be at the bar at either bar

95
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
Attitudes almost 80 years apart

96
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Women belonged in the private

97
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Fear

98
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
That was not only the place it was built into their

99
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Bodies

100
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
And that was the assumption

101
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Bro bong

102
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Long time

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
But just about

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
67

105
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
There a lot of women in this country who feel it there

106
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Being pushed around

107
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Things things had started to

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,271
Come to a boil

109
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Sex and race

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
Because they are easy visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into Superior and in

111
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Interior group

112
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
So in the late sixties and early seventies people like Gloria Steinem

113
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
No rules other than those chosen from the diseases of racism

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
Stop sexism up to get some traction

115
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Saying okay

116
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
It's time to put us in the Constitution hurry up and historians say it's a constitutional convention for women

117
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,647
I move the adoption of the following resolution

118
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
For something called the Equal Rights Amendment

119
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
What are your hopes what do you think of it will be ratified the stratified early next year

120
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
A1975 it will be ratified

121
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
But it's

122
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
Didn't get the boats in 1975

123
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
1976 will be the year

124
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,487
Or in 1976

125
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
4 in 1977 and the movement is stalled

126
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Why what

127
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
What stalled

128
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Well

129
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
A lot

130
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,591
But much of the credit goes to this woman

131
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
Come out in Illinois

132
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,295
Sloppily my husband Fred for letting me come today

133
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,671
I love to say that because it irritates the women's libbers more than anything that I said

134
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
She was a lawyer and a

135
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Self-described housewife

136
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Who started a movement

137
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Cold stop

138
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Yaris

139
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,471
The whole thing is misrepresented as a woman's rights amendment in fact the principal beneficiary will be mad

140
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Give man a great opportunity

141
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
How to get out from under their obligation

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
Her position was that the Equal Rights Amendment would actually strip women

143
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,503
The special privilege that they have that comes from being a woman

144
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
Why not I think though the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman and the wife has a great day

145
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Mini rights

146
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
For example she has the legal right

147
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
To be supported by her husband

148
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
And she said

149
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
If this amendment passes

150
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
It will be certain unintended consequences

151
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
Amendment says you cannot discriminate on account of facts and if you wanted to know

152
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
Marriage license to a man and a man or deny homosexual the right to teach in the school

153
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
It is on account of facts that you would deny it and that would be unconstitutional under era

154
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
And that argument

155
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,791
Caught on

156
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,399
They are things that could happen from the passage of an era time in

157
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
None of us would like to see happen generation after generation 2 tier

158
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,151
I think that there would be homosexual to expect preferential treatment

159
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
He said that it would endanger you got to hear what I have to say cuz you know what's going to happen if

160
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
There will be women and all of my bathroom stall

161
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Capacity RAV4

162
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
Had the Equal Rights Amendment passed

163
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,735
Legal editor Lynn Hershman against it would have looked a lot like the racial Civil Rights Movement

164
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
But the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass

165
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
It fell three

166
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
States

167
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Short

168
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,535
To get a constitutional amendment passed without any 3/4 of State legislatures

169
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
How to say they wanted

170
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
That is

171
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
38 out of 50

172
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
They only ever got 35

173
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Dude

174
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
So the question is

175
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
If you want to get equal rights

176
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
For women

177
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Written into the law

178
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
What do you do

179
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
There's no era

180
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
The women's lib movement sparked a backlash

181
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
What

182
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Do you do

183
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Well

184
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Enter stage left

185
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
The notorious RBG

186
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Ruth Bader Ginsburg RBG can do 20 push-ups and not the so-called girl kind snap before

187
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Or she was a Supreme Court Justice or a workout sensation before all that

188
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Ruth Ginsburg

189
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
She was

190
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
At the ACLU this was in the 70

191
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,927
And one of the characteristics of Ruth Ginsburg which exists to this day

192
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
You can hear this

193
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,863
It's the first time she argued in front of the Supreme Court in 1973

194
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
When you ask her a question there would be

195
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Silent

196
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:54,847
Enough silence

197
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
To make a person nervous and start trying to help her answer the question

198
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Kuwait

199
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
But

200
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
We can imagine

201
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
It was in one of those long top

202
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
At Ruth Bader Ginsburg

203
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
Rescued from the key principles behind the era

204
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Repackage them

205
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
And March them in through a side door sex like race

206
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Is a visible characteristics

207
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
Bearing no necessary relationship to ability

208
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Send library has been the major bases for unjustified for at least

209
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,495
It's like what what exactly did RBG do so let me walk you through an app

210
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
It's beautiful

211
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
The era fight is underway

212
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
And RBG and her colleagues are watching

213
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Right and they're getting worried

214
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
What if the array doesn't pass

215
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
What are we going to do if that's the

216
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
The case how are we going to get

217
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Equal rights for women

218
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
So they decided

219
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Okay

220
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
As an alternate approach let's go back to the 14th Amendment

221
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
The 14th amendments

222
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Immediate object

223
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
What's to provide nasty

224
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Protection

225
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
For the newly freed slaves

226
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
You know which

227
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,287
As we said was designed from the beginning to be only about race

228
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Suggest broader object

229
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
The states were prevented from depriving any person

230
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Equal protection

231
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Of the ball

232
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Well

233
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
It says the word person

234
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
So that

235
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Should include women

236
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
If they could just get the courts to see it that way then by default almost

237
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
We would have a sort of era

238
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
And accordingly

239
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
The task

240
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,679
Was showing that the racially inflected

241
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
14th Amendment apply to

242
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,847
2 secs the what about the law is she trying to change what what does she want the court

243
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
She say she wants the court to say

244
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,223
That sex would be treated just like race

245
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
And here's why that's so important

246
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
And the court sees racial discrimination happening

247
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
Under the Fourteenth Amendment it takes a really hard line

248
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
Looks at it really really closely

249
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
At least it's supposed to

250
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
Whereas other kinds of discrimination

251
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Not so much

252
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,215
Is actually some discrimination is necessary

253
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
It has to

254
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
It discriminates between 18 year old and 17 year old

255
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
Between criminal and non-criminal otherwise

256
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:41,247
But the courts decided that race is going to be a big red flag

257
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
They're going to ask governments legislators presidents

258
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,183
To have a compelling reason a compelling State interest to do race discrimination

259
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Otherwise

260
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
It's going to be unconstitutional

261
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
With me so far

262
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Yes

263
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
To discriminate based on race you need to pass it release

264
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Super hard test

265
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
By the way the legal name for this test

266
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Strict

267
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Scrutiny

268
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Call the lake

269
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
We mean business there's only like

270
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
But anyway the point was

271
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
But like they took it seriously

272
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Which you know back in the day they weren't doing with sex

273
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Discrimination at all

274
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,951
Because when legislators would come up with these Lots like this women can't be bartenders law

275
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Supreme Court would be like

276
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
You know

277
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
I probably have a good reason for that

278
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,631
Listen to review reason it can just be a reason

279
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
Doesn't have to be very good this up to be good

280
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,287
We could even maybe even make it up on the fly it just has to be a reason

281
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,127
For upholding this law like in the case of the bartenders law

282
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Bars are dangerous

283
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
Women need more protection in cordless be like okay

284
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
So RBG needed a way to convince the court

285
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
To be as

286
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Intense

287
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
About sex

288
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Discrimination

289
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
As they were about Reese

290
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Discrimination

291
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
How do you convince an audience of men

292
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Were used to discriminate on the base

293
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Sex

294
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Who been doing it for years

295
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
How do you convince them

296
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
That discrimination is a bad

297
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
I think of people who want to keep women down would like nothing better than to women go off in the corner

298
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
I speak only to win

299
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Nothing would happen

300
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
This is her giving a recent talk about her 1970 strategy

301
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
You need to persuade

302
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Men

303
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
If this is right for society

304
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
Part one of her strategy

305
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Choose your words carefully

306
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
The head of Secretariat Columbia

307
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,007
Who said I'm typing these things for you and jumping out all over the

308
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Pages

309
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Texas

310
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,127
Don't you know

311
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
The audience you are addressing

312
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,015
The first Association of those men

313
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
What the word sex

314
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
He's not what you're talking about

315
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
So you use a drama book

316
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Charm use gender

317
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
Cuz you know the word sex has a charge to it

318
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Gender

319
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Cooler

320
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
I'm parked over strategy

321
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Choose your

322
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Paces carefully

323
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
This is all happening in the 70

324
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
Please when RBG is the head of ACLU women's rights project

325
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,039
So she's deciding which kinds of cases the ACLU is going to support

326
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
As they make their way to an all-male

327
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Supreme Court

328
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Your strategy was

329
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
If we live in a man's world right now

330
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
We need to find cases

331
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
But nine men at this moment

332
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
Can handle so for example early on in her tenure at the women's rights project the other

333
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,895
Lefty lawyers are suggesting that the women's movement needs to take up the cause of us being right

334
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
And she says

335
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Not

336
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Yes and I think

337
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Go slow

338
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Is the right approach

339
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
She said first

340
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
We need to go after that

341
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Small

342
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Insidious idea

343
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
At the Supreme Court had been keeping alive for

344
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,911
4 years old the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman

345
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
That Phyllis Schlafly idea

346
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,311
That discrimination is actually good for women gender classifications

347
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
Will always rationalize

348
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
As favors

349
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Two women

350
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
And so

351
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,319
RBG decided not just to bring cases where women were the victims of discrimination

352
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Okay

353
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
My name is Curtis Craig she brought cases

354
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Where men wear the badge

355
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
Who were you as an 18 year old

356
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Now that's a great question

357
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
That was like any 18

358
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
You're old

359
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Young man

360
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Invincible

361
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,567
Get out of thought I was quite the ladies man if you name it I mean

362
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
You made it into Lambda Chi Alpha at Oklahoma State

363
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
He was living at the frat house

364
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Arab

365
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
A fraternity was

366
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
Primarily made up of wrestlers so was when you went down the hall

367
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
You're about to be taken down at any moment you be thrown into the wall

368
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
You leave a body print

369
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,423
What do you mean like an indentation literally in the wall or like

370
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,007
It was it was amazing

371
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
There was a lot of partying going on

372
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Lot of beer yard would be filled with beer cans here's the key if they wanted to get all that beer

373
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
They have to enlist the help

374
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Adelaide

375
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
Yeah I mean you know the sorority sisters yes you would have a female buy you a beer and you'd go out and

376
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:48,191
Party they need the women to buy beer in Oklahoma

377
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
State at the time

378
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Philly

379
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Girls could buy

380
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
At age 18 but the boys had to wait

381
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Until

382
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
21 was something about the level of maturity I guess for women versus men at that time

383
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Principal was that

384
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
Boys got into more car accidents so they should be trusted with blessed beer

385
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Did that make you angry or absolutely

386
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
Well I was extremely unfair yeah I would say

387
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,959
It made I think most men angry at the time

388
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
I'm a Supreme Court case

389
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Was born

390
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
So the 3rd

391
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
60 Boyz

392
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,479
I brought this

393
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Case

394
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,575
To the RBG RBG gets involved in this computer case

395
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,207
Yes but this is this is a this is a situation where women have rights men don't have

396
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Why would she want

397
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Argue this case

398
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Matcha tea want the office

399
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Well

400
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
This is

401
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Where

402
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Chris strategy is kind of like

403
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
A trojan horse

404
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
You look at this case right on the outside

405
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
It looks like

406
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
A case about men being discriminated

407
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
But if you think about it

408
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
Beneath that discrimination

409
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Is actually this kind of unspoken idea about women so go with me on this right if men

410
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
AR

411
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
Irresponsible they can't handle beer then women girls are more responsible and well-behaved

412
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
More delicate they can be trusted

413
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
With something like beer cuz they want abused it

414
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
You know so

415
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
With that line of thinking

416
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
It's not long before you're

417
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Trying to put

418
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Women

419
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Them from

420
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
You know scary places like

421
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
Bars or courtrooms for

422
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Political office

423
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Using this case

424
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
RBG is able to walk into the court

425
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
Is discrimination about men but also the discrimination against women that's

426
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Attached to it

427
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
In or inside of it

428
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Clever

429
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
We're just getting started

430
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
In just a minute

431
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096

435
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,040
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

436
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
And I'm here because I need your help

437
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
And I request

438
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,840
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

439
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

440
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,264
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

441
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

442
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
Kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

443
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Or maybe the kid was a piano

444
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,160
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

445
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,768
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

446
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
We're interested in the

447
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test if you

448
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
Please share with us

449
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

450
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
Record a short audio message for us

451
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224

Jad Robert Radiolab

454
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
Telling us a story of a case involving boys

455
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
And beer and

456
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,592
Illegal move which reminds you of the Wily Odysseus

457
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
Yeah and and that horse it's true

458
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:18,784
This case rocks that describe became something of a trojan horse

459
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
In the battle for women's rights

460
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
Know the story of the Trojan Horse maybe you know this it's you know ancient Greece

461
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:33,120
You got Sparta fighting Troy the Spartans want to get into the city of Troy

462
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
Giant walled City

463
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
Too big they can't get in

464
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
It's so Odysseus comes up with this clever plan

465
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
Give the Trojans this giant wooden horse

466
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
They'll bring it to their City

467
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Don't think it's a gift

468
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
We're retreating

469
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
What they thought

470
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:56,160
Are soldiers were hidden inside the horse will come out

471
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,768
And they will take the city

472
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
Now in our case Odysseus is as RBG

473
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
She said she's trying to get into is the all-male Supreme Court

474
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
What

475
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
In order for this

476
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Very

477
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
Admittedly imperfect we need someone in the horse to come out the warrior in the horse the woman warrior

478
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
And

479
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
In our case

480
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
That woman warrior

481
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
She didn't even know she was going to go into battle

482
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Julia you take from here

483
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
So

484
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
I got in the car

485
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,096
And I drove a long time tiny little crab

486
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
Road

487
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Leading up to

488
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984

489
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520

UltraStar

494
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
And so I walk up to this house it's this beautiful cream colored Cottage perched on top of a mountain

495
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Wow

She has like this

514
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
This air about her that she could have been a beauty queen you know

515
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
But she also could have been

516
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
A car mechanics

517
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,856
So we get to talkin I tell a little bit about who I am about to

518
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
The story

519
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,536
She actually told me like a French Lick that I'm proud of the young women I have a granddaughter there

520
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,632
Proud of you your generation they're finishing the fight I started

Was always Craig's name

528
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
So

529
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
You know it wasn't that big a deal

530
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
She told me she grew up

531
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Bouncing around different oil

532
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,512

And he was just a farm boy

547
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
With no education

She did not have any shortage of suitors betta not married him when turned a thing

555
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
And when I married

556
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
My husband I was equal to him except the money and he didn't think anybody

557
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
Can handle that but him

558
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
He acted like he was Raising me and he probably was

559
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
She says she was really comfortable with him

560
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Supercell

561
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Quiet Man whiskey

562
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Brilliant mind

563
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
But

564
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
He just

565
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
What he was pure German girl

566
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Have you ever met a German man

567
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
Okay they are in total control

568
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:32,128
And how does Carolyn connect to the case with the Frat Boys in RBT

569
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Okay so here's what happened

570
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,528
It's 1962 Carolyn and Wayne are about 20 years old at this point

571
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
Remove to a town called Stillwater Oklahoma

572
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Open a business

573
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,000
Stillwater

574
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Is a college down it's that color Stonegate got Oklahoma State University right there tons of

575
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,728
Fraternities including Lambda with the wrestlers

576
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,312
Huge homecoming drawing over 40000 alumni

577
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
We didn't know what homecoming was

578
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,456
Had no idea what homecoming was but shortly after moving to Stillwater

579
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
They open the doors

580
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,576
To the honk and holler

581
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
And where we went in was just about three blocks four blocks from the college

582
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
And we went into business there

583
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
A drive-through convenience

584
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,960
Real old gas station with oil pit in the floor years old work

585
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,288
Customers pull up to the side of the convenience store and

586
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
The drive-thru

587
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Honk their horn

588
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
Holler their order and you'd have to go out and wait on them come back in and get what they wanted and take it back

589
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
Took a lot of in and out and in and out

590
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
All night long you wear tennis shoes out real fast so he was all sheer energy

591
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Being gutsy

592
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,192
Homecoming night we were supposed to close its 11 the store is flooded with

593
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
Customers till

594
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
I think

595
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:08,128
Two or three in the morning they're like thrilled because they've never run a business by themselves before

596
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
And all these college kids are coming in and buying Coors beer

597
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
Including of course a steady stream of girls buying

598
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,928
Ear presumably for their boyfriend and it is yeah I never did get to see homecoming

599
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,256
All I saw was cars coming in and out

600
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Fast forward a few years

601
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
1972

602
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
Back at the University Inn at all

603
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,520
Had long blonde hair Curtis Craig buddy named Mark Walker

604
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
The time is it a political science class

605
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
And the professor starts talking about the whole fight for the era which is happening right at that moment

606
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,064
And at this point Oklahoma hasn't ratified the era

607
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
Somehow the conversation turns to

608
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
MRSA

609
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
Talk about discrimination this beer law

610
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
Is discrimination against us in the professor challenged him about doing something about the beer laws if he was go

611
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Going to complain about him

612
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
The one day

613
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
I was behind the counter people coming in and out Mark Walker walks into the honk and holler the young man

614
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,456
Came in to talk to me she doesn't really have time to talk she's running in and out but

615
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
They stood there

616
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
Waiting patiently I bet he was in there for hours and he was looking at the beer license you looked at the lights

617
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
A nurse is that Caroline's name

618
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Is the one on it

619
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,816
Because actually my husband lost his license after he sold beer to a young man

620
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
So he put them in my name

621
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
Anyway at a certain point

622
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
In between all the hunks and hollers he asked me

623
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
What I thought about the beer laws

624
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
And I told him

625
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:48,992
I was very vocal about it I always had been she says it doesn't make any sense we send these young men off to war

626
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,576
We're being drafted at 18 we don't let them drink beer when they come back

627
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
Was that jazz

628
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
At The Mention the liability issues you have these 18 year old girls coming in buying beer slipping into their boyfriends

629
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,072
How am I supposed to stop at your you can't prove

630
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Who buys what

631
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
So eventually when Mark Walker asked

632
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
For her help he

633
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
Said he was going to do a term paper

634
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,336
She's like sure why not I was always willing to help them

635
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Because they had help

636
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Get started

637
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
And I still thought it was a term paper

638
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,808
So was he not being completely honest with you then

639
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Well I didn't hear half of what he said

640
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
I was busy every time he came in

641
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
So you know

642
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,792
It wasn't that important at the time

643
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
So I didn't think any more about it

644
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
He left my husband was gone

645
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
He was the out-of-state working

646
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
And I know I didn't say anything to him about it it wasn't important

647
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,128
You know I just thought it was a conversation

648
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
But it wasn't just a conversation

649
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Because before that meeting

650
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Mark had gone out

651
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Looking for a lawyer

652
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
That's correct

653
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
And Curtis and Mark and the other frat brothers

654
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,464
I tried to race the money that was flawed in a campus town

655
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Her body

656
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,048
Use their last dollar for that last beer

657
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
But they managed to find his lawyer who would do it

658
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
I'm a sheep

659
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
Alright well I'm just Fred Gilbert attorney at law

660
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
No big signal nobigdyl

661
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
Remember I'm always wearing his military boots

662
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
Actually I'm bleeding

663
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:23,968
Moorim even to the Supreme Court Fred had worked on another male discrimination case

664
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
In the past

665
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,856
And this case was pretty straightforward

666
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,000
Most irresponsible and drunken woman in the state could buy it and limited quantities that 18

667
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
Well that was discrimination

668
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,096
Become more male rights

669
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Case

670
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
What was

671
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,776
And do you remember corresponding with Ruth Ruth Bader Ginsburg

672
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

673
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Before she was on the court

674
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
Somehow Ruth Bader Ginsburg noticed

675
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
And she watched

676
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
As Fred made his way up the courts

677
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Losing at every level

678
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
And by this point

679
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,696
Ruth Bader Ginsburg with head of the women's rights project at the ACLU

680
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,024
She's already argued a few cases before The Supreme Court

681
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
Which had in the courts

682
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Slowly

683
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
For the idea that sex

684
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
Was like race

685
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
And she thought that this case

686
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Was interested

687
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
She gave protocol

688
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,104
We have a problem in a personal relationship has no question

689
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,456
I was something of an unreconstructed male chauvinist

690
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
She was not

691
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,296
Fred did not see this as a women's rights

692
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,392
Was just kind of an unnecessary insult a man for no reason

693
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
Looking at this case

694
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Got no Fred

695
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
It's more than that

696
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
It didn't matter to her

697
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
If the plaintiff was a man or a woman because in most of those cases

698
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,216
The discrimination against the man was derivative

699
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,544
Of a prior and worst discrimination against the woman

700
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
Here's to the ladies the fair and the weak

701
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
How do they do

702
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
Where do I find all that energy

703
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
That's seemingly inexhaustible store of Pep and Ginger

704
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Again

705
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,208
Bruce was after the stereotype about women that was nestled inside the beer law

706
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
That women are more responsible and well-behaved

707
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,448
But in order for her to make that connection she needed Fred to write his brief in a way that would be useful for

708
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,776
So prefer not just to male discrimination

709
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,848
But discrimination based on gender

710
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Well

711
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
I supported her

712
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
I just never was

713
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
Shall we say a militant feminist

714
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
To like

715
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Ruth had her work cut out for her

716
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
What you was getting sort of used to dealing with these robes

717
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
So with other local lawyers that she'd worked with in the past

718
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Ruth have been more forceful

719
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
Insisting that she make the argument

720
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
But that had backfired

721
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:55,520
So she likes like okay you argue it right she was afraid telling him that she didn't need to be the one to present or large

722
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Before the court

723
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
She was fine if he'd do it

724
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,176
But she very gently very persistently

725
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,016
I was able to convince him to let her help him with his legal brief

726
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Betta

727
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
I think it was a

728
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,440
Couple months later cuz my husband was out-of-state every month

729
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,024
Meanwhile back at the honk and holler Carolyn has no idea what's going on

730
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
No

731
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
No idea

732
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,632
And I got a phone call

733
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
My husband was on the phone

734
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,264
We'll have salesman in and I had people coming in and out

735
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
And

736
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
He was

737
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
I right

738
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
He was

739
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Furious

740
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
I couldn't figure out what was going on she was like

741
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,320
Case are you talking about well he had picked up a newspaper

742
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
In North Carolina and a bank

743
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
And it was on the front page of the newspaper

744
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
With my name and

745
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
About us suing

746
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,424
It look like we sued everybody in the state of Oklahoma that was in office

747
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
All way down to the

748
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
Garbage man he's like

749
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
What did you do how are you we don't want to get mixed up in this we don't want her name on this we don't want to make a fuss like this could hurt

750
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,552
Business like how dare you you know I didn't know what happened I really didn't know and eventually she figured out

751
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
It must have been that kid came in here

752
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,160
And now it's like at the Supreme Court

753
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:22,560
What I was back and forth on that phone with him trying to wait on customers and I bet that

754
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,936
I took about three hours and he would not let up I mean he kept calling back and call him back

755
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,008
He called the lawyer he was mad

756
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,664
And then the last phone call he said I am flying back in and he said you pick me up

757
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Couple nights later

758
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Drove to the airport

759
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Picked him up

760
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Anna

761
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
He was still mad

762
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
That was the longest

763
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Car ride

764
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
As they drove back

765
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
She says he just

766
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
Lectured her

767
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
The whole ride

768
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,168
I just listened to him

769
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
What did he say

770
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't know what he said word to word

771
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
Yeah I just know he was strong with what he said

772
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
With my husband it was best to just be silent

773
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
I was never afraid of him

774
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
But

775
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
I knew how far to push it

776
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,864
Tommy got from the airport to the other side it was about an hour and 20 minutes

777
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,704
That's a long an hour and 20 minutes in the car where you can't get out

778
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
And

779
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,824
Over the course of that hour and 20 minutes

780
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
She said something in her

781
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Shifted

782
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
And at a certain point she

783
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Basically turned to him and was like

784
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
No

785
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
Like I know you want me to drop this case

786
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,744
But I'm going to fight this out he threatened me Every Witch Way

787
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
I didn't budge

788
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Probably

789
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
The reason why I didn't budge

790
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
Because he fought me so hard on it

791
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
You know I believed in it

792
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
That I had never step

793
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
Out like that that's the first time I really

794
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
Put my foot down and didn't budge

795
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
I gave so much to him

796
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
I mean

797
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
I didn't get a salary for 25 years

798
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
I didn't ask for

799
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
I figured we were equal

800
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,328
I figured I work the same hours he did

801
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
And I figured I stood

802
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Deciding

803
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
Not behind him and not in front of them

804
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
October 5th 1976

805
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Day of oral arguments

806
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,480
The lawyer Fred Gilbert across very many people that I didn't care for him I didn't care for

807
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
He was so

808
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Pushy

809
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Insist

810
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
That Caroline needs to come to the

811
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
I didn't have the money to go and I didn't want to go and never traveled anywhere by myself what I recall that day

812
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
Curtis Craig came to I was dressed up

813
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,632
Suitandtie had borrowed address

814
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
Plastic look like leather

815
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,824
Walking up those stairs high heels I remember that distinctly it was so big beautiful building

816
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,968
I felt like I was walking forever up those stairs I was burning up I was sweating

817
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
Will hear arguments next

818
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,624
75628 Craig against Florida

819
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
Whenever you're ready

820
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
Fred Gilbert starts things off

821
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,352
Walks up to the podium in his combat boots

822
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
Broad

823
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,032
Females even those are the most drunk

824
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
Most alcoholic most immature

825
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
Most irresponsible

826
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
My purchase 3.2% beer at age 8

827
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Absolutely unlimited point

828
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,368
And by all accounts

829
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
You didn't exactly kill it

830
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
The words

831
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:10,400
Justices just kept hammering

832
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
Movies age backing track

833
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,824
Hammering

834
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Before the court

835
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
What's before the cord is your

836
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
Curtis was sitting beside me and I kept punching what does that mean what are they talking about what is that

837
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Mayonnaise kept saying

838
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Be quiet

839
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
Who is over I'll tell you

840
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,008
I didn't understand what they were doing it

841
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
18 night but she says what caught her ear was a moment when just

842
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,431
Shrine quests when you call me

843
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,015
You're referring to your client who is the tavern keeper

844
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
Saloonkeeper

845
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
Sognare standing up and corrected him and I've always wondered to this day when I did

846
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,423
As arguments went on Fred did at least try to do the thing that roof when I can

847
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
You could pass a law saying

848
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
No negro

849
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
Compare sex discrimination to race

850
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Discrimination

851
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,783
How this relates to the public thing but the thing is you can't discriminate

852
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
Even for something like public safety on the basis of certain criteria

853
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:41,023
What is the court ever held the Discrimination of this sort is of the same class as discrimination on the basis of race

854
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,143
Got to this court has come very very I ask you a question has it ever held

855
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
I just totally

856
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Be treated the same as rice

857
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
To make a long story short

858
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
By the end of oral argument

859
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
Things weren't looking great

860
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,735
4 fret

861
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,319
1.2 even interrupt

862
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
A Supreme Court Justice

863
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
You don't do that

864
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Denial of fear

865
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
It just

866
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:19,167
Yeah wasn't happening

867
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Well

868
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
You win some you lose some

869
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Right

870
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Ladies

871
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
What no no no

872
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Here Comes

873
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
The craziest part of the story

874
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,015
Double trojan horse horse within a horse because

875
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
After the Fred Gilbert debacle

876
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:43,231
There was another case at the Supreme Court that afternoon

877
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:48,607
So happened that it was a case being argued

878
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,191
By none other than Ruth

879
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,775
Bader Ginsburg organize I've not forgotten how

880
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
To get that August

881
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
The same day that was on purpose

882
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
Yeah oh yeah oh my God

883
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,455
Genius

884
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
You somehow managed to get herself in the port on another case on the same day so I couldn't confirm

885
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Firm that for sure

886
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
I don't even know how you would do that but what I can tell you is that

887
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,047
She arranged to go second

888
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:23,167
Because she knew there was probably a good chance that Fred just be completely incompetent lawyer

889
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Was going to be

890
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
You know less than amazing

891
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
The car

892
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:32,639
Was asking him questions he was completely incapable of answering NVM

893
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,015
Turn up to argue her case they ask her about Greg people

894
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Concrete involving

895
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,135
Emails to make certain emails

896
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Discrimination against

897
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,047
My question is whether we should examine that law under the same or a difference

898
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
Discrimination against

899
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
In part because such a loss

900
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Impact against

901
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
And then she told Justice Stevens

902
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Even in this case

903
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,175
It seems like men are the ones who are being discriminated against

904
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,551
I need that discrimination is a more Insidious 1

905
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,903
Compliance safety

906
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
Discrimination against female

907
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,535
Is it your view that there is no discrimination against male

908
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
I think there is

909
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
Discrimination against

910
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
My response to that

911
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Justice Stevens

912
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,407
That almost every discrimination that operates against males operates

913
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Females as well

914
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
Is that a yes or no answer

915
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,855
I just don't understand you and I are you trying to avoid the question or

916
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Avoid the question

917
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
I'm trying to

918
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Popeye the position

919
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
But I don't know of any line that doesn't

920
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
It doesn't work as a

921
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
They go back and forth a bit

922
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
Jessey Stevens is basically like

923
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
Why do you keep insisting on this

924
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,983
Why do you keep saying that discrimination

925
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,543
Against men contains within it

926
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
Discrimination against women

927
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,383
You're different and you like no they're not different

928
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,759
Is it discrimination against me

929
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,575
If my case depends on your recognition

930
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
That

931
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Using gender

932
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
As a classification

933
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
Resorting to. Classic

934
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Scotty questionable

935
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
And should be

936
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Closely

937
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Reviews

938
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Makes this point again and again

939
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,959
All discrimination based on gender is bad

940
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,543
HP checked with something at least approaching that

941
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Hardcore standard

942
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
At the court uses for race

943
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,663
That was really something

944
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
Seeing this little woman

945
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
Get out

946
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Gmail

947
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Discrimination

948
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,671
I'll never forget that because she was small

949
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
Yes

950
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
She's so small in person

951
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
Had a lot of force

952
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
Cases submitted

953
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
About two months later

954
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
December 20th 1976

955
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Craig

956
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
Justice William Brennan announces that the

957
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
The court

958
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
Is breaking down the beer law

959
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,879
We hold that Oklahoma's gender-based differential

960
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Does constitute

961
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
An invidious violation

962
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
Billy beer case

963
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,119
Was basically the first time the court

964
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
Clearly set

965
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,703
That when you discriminate based on gender

966
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Need to pass

967
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Heart attack

968
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
It wasn't as rigorous as race

969
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
It wasn't

970
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
Strict scrutiny

971
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,479
They settled on a standard that we now call intermediate scrutiny

972
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
But pretty damn close

973
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:57,695
RBG would go on to strengthen the standard overtime

974
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
But this was the case

975
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
That first

976
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,607
Got us a kind of Equal Rights Amendment

977
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
Suicide door

978
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
We wish

979
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
That the court had picked

980
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
Alaska property case

981
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
Make that announcement

982
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
But of course

983
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
Very pleased that

984
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
The day the decision was announced

985
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
I had just came in from work I was at home

986
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
By myself here in Stillwater

987
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
She's by herself in the kitchen

988
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
The phone rings and who calls

989
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Called

990
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,559
National news call to tell me that

991
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
We had one

992
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
I didn't ask

993
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
What we had one

994
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
I didn't ask anything

995
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
I just said okay

996
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
She hung up

997
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,967
Stood there for a little bit and then Craig called and he wanted me to come down and celebrate with the guys there at his

998
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Fraternity fraternity

999
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
She told them

1000
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
No thanks

1001
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
And then she hangs up the phone

1002
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
Did you get the one more phone call

1003
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
And it was my husband he was in

1004
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
North

1005
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Caroline again

1006
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
And he heard

1007
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,143
He heard something about the case but he didn't hear it all

1008
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,239
And he said what's going on now and I said

1009
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
We won

1010
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
And he says

1011
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Is it over

1012
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
I said is over

1013
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Totally over with

1014
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
He said good

1015
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
And he hung up

1016
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
I fix me a very

1017
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Good

1018
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Drinks

1019
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Vodka and Coke

1020
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,719
Set down the middle of the floor and that's the way I celebrated

1021
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,327
I drank that drank all by myself and it was over with

1022
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
It was over with

1023
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
Caroline says that

1024
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Decades

1025
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
After this case

1026
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
She didn't understand what it meant

1027
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
She didn't understand

1028
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,527
Is it legal principle or that it ushered in this new era

1029
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
For women in this country

1030
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
But even so

1031
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
In

1032
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Her own life

1033
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
This case

1034
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Was it beginning

1035
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,935
A couple of years after we won that case

1036
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
I went into China

1037
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,031
Right after it opened up

1038
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,591
She saved up money and went with her sister-in-law

1039
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Brandon 1

1040
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
I did I was so curious

1041
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
And we never went like the tourist went

1042
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
We get on a train and if we saw something we wanted to stop and see

1043
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
We would stop

1044
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
We never had a schedule

1045
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,559
And I never did really go to shop I was just

1046
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,839
Curious about the people

1047
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
And how they lived

1048
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
That's so so much

1049
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,495
And I talked to so many people while I was gone

1050
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
That

1051
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
It was like a hunger

1052
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,991
And you grow from it

1053
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
And I just wanted to see things

1054
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,415
And that was just that just open the doors for me

1055
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
What happened to Caroline at the end

1056
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367
Xi'an Duane divorce in mm

1057
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,207
And and when you and when you said she didn't know

1058
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
The effector KSAT

1059
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
For decades like when did she figure it out or what

1060
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
What what how

1061
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
So

1062
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,143
In around 1996

1063
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,959
This professor guy named Bob Darcy called her up

1064
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
And invite her to speak

1065
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
At

1066
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Class

1067
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
End

1068
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,199
She is kind of learning from the students and from the professor like what the keys actually

1069
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
We stood for

1070
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
And then eventually.

1071
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,015
Professor Putzer

1072
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,831
In touch with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and they meet

1073
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Again

1074
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
In person

1075
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
And

1076
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,975
It's sort of starts to. On her

1077
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
One of the letters

1078
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
I don't know if that's the one

1079
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
When were sitting in her bedroom

1080
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:57,983
She was looking through some old letters and pulled out one with the Supreme Court

1081
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
Still on it

1082
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:06,687
No I don't have my glasses you'll have to read the cashier Carolyn as I told you in 1996 and we celebrated the 20th and

1083
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
York Rite vs born

1084
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
You are the true heroine of that case

1085
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,831
Although no financial gain with us

1086
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,415
Steak for you you realize the potential the case had in Paving the way

1087
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,767
For the Court's recognition of equal citizenship stature of men and women

1088
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Wisconsin

1089
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Principal

1090
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
How about I was going to go

1091
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
Framed

1092
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
I haven't done it yet

1093
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,847
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg I need to get it laminated for I have your Prime

1094
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
Producer

1095
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,647
Julia Longoria

1096
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:52,511
What's her to hits me hearing this episode is

1097
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,815
I think the phrase radical gradualism

1098
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
That I I was trying to Source it before I walked in but there's a kind of did there's an emotional disa

1099
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,615
The blind to her approach that I'm just not just in but that I crave

1100
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,175
In this in this very tumultuous moment

1101
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,527
It also like the empathy of it that's the trick because she figures okay

1102
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,647
These guys are going to understand if their group gets

1103
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
Discriminated against

1104
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
