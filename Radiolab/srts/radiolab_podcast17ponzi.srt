1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
So it may be just want to start at the beginning so how did you bump into the

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,672
We've had you been following Financial stories and not I did some Financial storage but I think my beat was more

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,024
People in the headlines at the worst moments of their lives

7
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
And then I would go in and

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,448
Become their friends and we would talk intimately about

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
What downfall means when you've been at the mountain

10
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Top

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod Radiolab

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,624
A behind-the-scenes look at the greatest financial fraud

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
In history

14
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
What's going on here

15
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,072
Play come on baby I know you got

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,752
It's a series called Ponzi Supernova from audible.com and she said of how we got to

17
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,848
Ellenhorn the great Eleanor and who was one of the founding members of Radiolab

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
Couple years ago she left us

19
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
It was raining that for us but you went off to Audible

20
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
Teamed up with a guy named Steve Fishman who just heard

21
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
And together they produce

22
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
This series which has tape in it that has never before been hurt

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
And it's pretty extraordinary and kind of

24
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
Given what's happened recently with

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Financial reforms

26
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
App for reconsideration

27
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
What you're about to hear you will find

28
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,984
A little bit troubling an extremely Timely

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,104
Until what we did a couple days ago we got Steve and Ellen into the studio

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Play us some stuff

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
And to think about it

32
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
Sure you spend the first episode

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Really

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,344
You spend the first episode really chasing

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
The guy trying to get access to Bernie Madoff in prison

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,536
Yeah you know I did all kinds of things that mean this was like years long

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Pursuit I would send Bernie

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,168
Novels in the mail I would try and up

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,032
Insult him I copied out Sartre play No Exit

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
And I sent that to him

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
You know just to try and get a rise out

42
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
I put money in his commissary account and then

43
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
You know send him a you're welcome note

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,392
Never receiving a response do you know why at this point

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
What was driving this

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
I mean listen Bernie has done this

47
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,816
I mean everybody does and we keep reading about the details and we keep

48
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
Triangulating Bernie from friends who very obviously didn't know him investors who buy these they obviously didn't know him

49
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
I want to hear this guy

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,128
Tell me I want to say where are you why did you do this you were already rich

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Come on

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
What's going on here

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
I mean

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Bernie

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,320
Had the greatest seat in the house

56
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
To what was going on

57
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Behind the scene

58
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
Steve is explained to us for years he just kept pestering the guy in prison

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,912
Do I like a whole series of other prisoners asking them to get the word to Bernie and

60
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
Eventually just cut to the chase one day my home phone ring

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
So I pick it up it's a Sunday evening the Jets

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Game is on and I

63
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,456
Got my two young kids running around at it

64
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
You have a collect call from an inmate at the federal prison and then and then you can Bernese voicing Bernard Madoff in the sky

65
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Kind of

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
I need a kind of disgusted

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
That tone of voice and a nice like Captain Ahab but now you have kids running around the room at Jets game on here

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
The phone call oh my God are you ready or not

69
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,264
And I'm not ready I don't have a pen and paper I don't have a tape recorder

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
And my kids are

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Hey kids

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,296
So then it called come out only in 15 minutes

73
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
Sads

74
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
For whatever reason there exactly 15 minutes exactly 15 minutes

75
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Wait 15 minutes

76
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,679
Call you back while he hangs up I know at 15 minutes I'm running around

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Well I must have a tape recorder

78
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
I'm on in a closet

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Tested

80
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
At this point we're just going to drop into the series

81
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,719
Yeah I was just saying it was great to talk to you because

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
You know talking to you in person is so different than reading about you all day

83
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Caricature out there in the

84
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
I will send to you as being a

85
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
You know just as one-dimensional person

86
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
So what

87
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Bernie Madoff is the greatest Financial

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Trucking history

89
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
But his voice is familiar to

90
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
Middle could be the uncle I run into at bar mitzvahs

91
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
We have common roots

92
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Middle-class New York Jews

93
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
And also and

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Interesting the Jets

95
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
I got it recorded

96
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Yeah I like that

97
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,519
Increase

98
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,663
I try to imagine the former chairman of the NASDAQ

99
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
At a payphone in a Cell Block

100
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Inmates lined up behind him

101
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
With prison made tattoos

102
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Prison Hound muscles

103
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
Oh and you can eat and you can call at night to

104
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Prison

105
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Is not with Bernie expect

106
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Pretty big picture window

107
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
Open it from being separated from everybody in love

108
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Time's up

109
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
It's frustrating

110
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
Nicole starts we build momentum

111
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Journey Begins to open up

112
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
And then

113
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
The guillotine Falls

114
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Trust is tough to build on a timer

115
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
And I need to be the person he will trust

116
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
The whole story

117
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
At least

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
As he sees it

119
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
Bernie lets me know he has a story to tell

120
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
He's been misunderstood

121
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
I'm a good person he tells me

122
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
He starts with this

123
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
His family didn't have a clue

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Bernie and Sissy shielded

125
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Ace family

126
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Nobly

127
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Kept them in the dark

128
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
Until the on seasonably warm afternoon of December 10th

129
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,015
2008 he was at his office

130
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Bernard L Madoff securities

131
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
A family business

132
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,951
What happened

133
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,399
They went into Bernie study

134
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
I don't know what else to tell you I said but

135
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
And nobody gets angry at that point

136
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Everything is fine

137
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,503
Andrew Birnie youngest son have been diagnosed with lymphoma 5 years earlier

138
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Afforded and recovered fully

139
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
He consider changing jobs

140
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
But Bernie talked him into returning

141
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
To work beside his dad his

142
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
His brother

143
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
His uncle

144
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
His first cousin

145
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,607
Really

146
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
As for what happened next

147
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Daily left

148
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,895
They went to a lawyer that you got to turn your father and I never saw him again

149
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
And didn't hear from them again

150
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783
Until two years into Bernie's 150 year sentence

151
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
His oldest son Mark sent a message

152
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
In the most horrible way

153
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
End

154
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
Roots on the phone and she tells you

155
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
Mark Madoff killed himself at age 46

156
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Hung himself with a dog leash in his Soho Loft

157
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
While his toddler slept in the room next door

158
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
The date

159
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
December 11th 2010

160
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
2 years to the day

161
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
After his father's arrest

162
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
The Bernie marks message to him was

163
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
What's clear

164
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
You

165
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Ruin my life

166
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
Bernie told me he still hoped he could reach Andrew

167
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
And explain

168
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
But Andrews cancer returned

169
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
He blame the relapse on his father's crimes

170
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
The stress and shame of it all

171
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Andrew Madoff died in 2014

172
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Bernie's always a survivor

173
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,551
Once he confessed to the largest Ponzi scheme in history

174
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
For him

175
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
The worst was over

176
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Be able to get this off your

177
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Show

178
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Earlier

179
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
It was

180
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Absolute

181
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
It was a nightmare

182
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
When you were looking down the barrel of this

183
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
You kind of knew it would end up here

184
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,367
You know where you are now by sooner or later

185
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Destroyed the family

186
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Need to do this and I said

187
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
I don't know

188
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Yeah

189
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,383
They have wonderful psychologist

190
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Well that's great

191
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
That's right

192
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
That's great

193
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
A New Yorker and his shrink

194
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Seeking reassurance

195
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Searching for answers

196
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Where does a monster come from

197
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,839
Am I a sociopath

198
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Not a sociopath

199
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
You have fun

200
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
I came to think of my conversations with Bernie as a

201
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,687
So III status what are you thinking at this point is you're talking to

202
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,295
I mean we're running through his story and beef develop the kind of Rapport I mean

203
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Udo

204
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
But there's a different generation but Jewish roots New York area this is a guy

205
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Who's familiar to me and I

206
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
And we developed a report and Bernie kind of tells me the story

207
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
Of his father and of how he got into this

208
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
Sporting Goods

209
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Metal rod

210
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
And it during the Korean War

211
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
You watch that happen

212
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Everything

213
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Bernie West

214
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
Determined to attain success last

215
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
The kind that had eluded his father

216
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Whatever it

217
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
22 years old

218
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,999
He convinces a handful of investors to

219
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Trust him

220
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,631
Prince parents former customers of his high school lawn sprinkler business

221
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Clients of his father-in-law's

222
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,287
Accounting firm

223
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
New issues were hot in the 1960s

224
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
Go without the Mad scramble and hype of today's IPOs

225
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
Back then there was no CNBC no computers

226
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,391
With new issues he thought he'd hit on a money-making strategy

227
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,487
Practice 62 with a Cuban Missile Crisis

228
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Bernie lost almost all of

229
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Is clients money

230
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Is he tell that he was embarrassed

231
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
He was in tears

232
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
We took them to her father

233
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Bernie bags

234
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
His father-in-law saved

235
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Bernie needed a better

236
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Strategy

237
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
The odds were against him is he saw

238
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,487
Bernie wasn't one of the Wall Street Elite

239
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Steve says

240
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
That idea like a Bernie is that

241
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,687
As a lower class kid from Queens who want to prove himself to the big boys be accepted

242
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,271
Citas that's one of the keys to really understand how

243
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,599
A guy like Bernie Madoff could have gotten into this gigantic

244
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Check fraud because

245
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,695
When Bernie's business started to really take off

246
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Possibly

247
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Increasingly through fraud

248
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
All of a sudden he had all these guys from the big Banks

249
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,911
Calling them up and wanted to take him out to lunch by the mid-90s word

250
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,727
Spread people clamor to put their money in Madoff

251
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Hedge funds Bank funds and feeder

252
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Funds created to funnel money to Madoff

253
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
To Pumped out

254
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759

Sip returns

257
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
Everyone wanted to be with Bernie

Country Club golfers

Hedge funds prestigious Bank

260
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
No but we need you to commit to the money

261
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
According to Bernie

262
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
This was the turning point

263
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
The market went against him

264
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
The boy Genius failed

265
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
And they lose your money

266
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
That was his undoing

267
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,735
He couldn't move billions of dollars in and out

268
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Of the market

269
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
Irresistible for the young man wants shut out of the

270
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Club

271
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,167
You know where you had a history of

272
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,543
You know breaking up in the country club at the New York Stock Exchange with the market makers

273
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Now in some sense I guess your

274
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
You're finally getting the record

275
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Recognition

276
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Kind of same people that

277
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
They need you

278
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
The Mummy 2

279
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,767
Can I get something out of the way till Ponzi scheme which we sort of need to know Ponzi scheme is

280
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
I give you money to invest

281
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
You pretend you invest that money but you don't

282
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Right said what you do is you go out and you get new investors take their money give it to me and then you can go out and get even

283
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,407
Newer investors take their money given to the ones before them and on and on and on

284
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,295
Cilic all you're doing is just repositioning money like taking it from the new guys giving it to the slightly the last new guys

285
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
Making it look like you're trading when you're not and it only works

286
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,023
As long as you have new people coming in young need a constant stream of new people coming in with new money

287
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
But that'll

288
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Stella Parton 2008

289
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
2008 Riviera

290
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Huge

291
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Stock market

292
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Bernie woke up after decade

293
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Getting a lot of money in one day

294
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,919
People. I want my money back I chew me too me too and he had not done anything

295
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Except

296
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,783
Expect more money to come to the front door on that day there was no money

297
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
And so

298
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Bernie's version

299
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,511
The fraud started because impressive people threw money at him

300
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
A good person

301
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Who made a mistake

302
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
We spent hours talking about this

303
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:56,031
And it seems to me at some point that there's always going to be that next phone call

304
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
But there's that Gap you know 15 minutes I have to wait until the phone rings then

305
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
And 1 time the phone doesn't ring

306
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Bernie doesn't call back

307
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
And I get from the

308
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Prison a letter

309
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Basically explaining that I have been

310
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
Declared a security risk

311
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
What is a security risk

312
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
I have no idea and

313
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:24,447
You know it is some kind of casual I mean I try to appeal that to the Bureau of Prisons is an appealable so base

314
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
The warden says

315
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
You know

316
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
We don't want this disaster

317
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
It always is

318
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Security risk you can't talk

319
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,383
An injustice in upside just so

320
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
At this point

321
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,735
But having spent a hunk of time

322
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
You you went into this thinking okay I'm going to sit in his shoes

323
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
I'm going to

324
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Feeling

325
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
And where are you right now

326
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
At this point

327
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,279
So now I've spoken to him for three or more hours

328
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
And

329
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
You don't like taking this journey with him

330
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Hershey Story

331
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,239
You know I have felt some empathy for

332
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
Bernie from his point of view

333
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
I'm so now I start to listen to the tapes and I

334
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
I start to really kind of digging in it

335
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
And it occurs to me

336
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
The bird is telling me to story

337
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Bernie Madoff

338
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
On one hand is this

339
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Wizard

340
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Conducting this game

341
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Rideable Financial

342
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
Criminal Wizardry

343
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
A mastermind

344
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
And on the other hand he's just kind of poem

345
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
P***

346
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,240
Not aware you normally associate with Bernie Madoff

347
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
More on that after the break has what ends up happening with the cool Revelations of the series is

348
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
The way in which Bernie actually sees himself

349
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
As a victim

350
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,296
And it's here where the story sort of starts to expand Beyond

351
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
Can you start the sort of C

352
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
How much bigger field of play

353
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
Yeah that's coming up after the break

354
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888

00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

360
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
And I'm here because I need your help

361
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
And I request

362
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

363
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,144
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

364
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

365
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

366
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,224
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

367
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Or maybe the kid was a piano

368
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,136
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

369
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,744

How Bernie Madoff and his team pull it off

389
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304

They almost got caught

391
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Former US attorney Matthew Schwartz

A conference room

401
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
Full of auditors

402
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,208
One asks for this routine report

403
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
Something illegitimate trading firm

404
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Would have on the Shelf

405
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
Of course Madoff isn't illegitimate trading firm

406
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
So they don't have it

407
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
And quick Frank

In front of the auditors

00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
Frank phones the computer programmers

411
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Incest

412
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
Hey can you bring up the sciac reports

413
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
You told us we didn't need the Sonic report where the hell am I going to get a sciatic

416
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Report

00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
This is great I'll see you in 10 minutes

418
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
You know that he does

419
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
This is he

420
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Describe that a little soft-shoe to stall for time

421
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
Meanwhile the team has minutes

422
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
It's to prepare a false report

423
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
And then make it appear

424
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
As if it's been idling on a Shelf

425
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
They're frantically putting together and printing out

426
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
This

427
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Report which is you know it's

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Half a foot thick

429
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
I'm just being paper dot matrix paper

430
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
And then it supposed to be

431
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
A report

432
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
It's been lying around for a month and it said it's hot off

433
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Depresses

434
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
So

435
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
First

436
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
They stick it in

437
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Refrigerator

438
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Down in the investment advisory

439
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Cool it off

440
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
And then they literally

441
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
Play football with it

442
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Horsing around the room to one another to make it

443
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Weather

444
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
And then they run it up to a

445
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Pascal

446
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Cooley

447
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Hands it to the auditors

448
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
The clothes called

449
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Over and over again

450
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Fabulous theater

451
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672
Steve actually described Bernie madoff's operation

452
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
You're the created like this

453
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
Massive 65 billion dollar fraud

454
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
As looks

455
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Super recognizer

456
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Busy held together by

457
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Taping

458
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Safety pins and old

459
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
Dot matrix printers in the series goes into a lot of details about

460
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,080
To the mechanics and how it worked what caught our attention

461
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:28,480
What's the thing that we sort of mentioned for the break this idea that Bernie saw himself not as this like all-powerful

462
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,784
Criminal mastermind

463
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,184
But it's kind of a pain yeah there was an original group of investors that Bernie made up

464
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
And this group is called the Big Four

465
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
And that's exactly right the Big Four

466
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,888
They came to be known even made off calls in the Big 4

467
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,192
For Prime big clients

468
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
Jeffry picower

469
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Norman Levy

470
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
Call Shapiro

471
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Stanley Chase

472
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
Commonly referred to as the Big Four

473
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
It was very clear

474
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,344
That those accounts in particular Shapiro Levy

475
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Picower

476
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,512
And Chase former assistant us attorney Matt Schwartz again or handled very differently

477
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
From other accounts

478
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
And we're Handles in a way

479
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
That you no matter less if there was a mistake

480
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
For these accounts the workmanship was quite different

481
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
More demanding

482
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Less

483
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Exacting

484
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Some

485
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Employees were

486
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:35,040
More meticulous than others and some clients you could afford to be less meticulous with

487
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
Annette Bongiorno have been there a long time

488
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
She was employee number one in the Ponzi business

489
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
Garfinkel tell me she handle the accounts of the Big Four

490
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,656
Steve garfinkel was one of the FBI agents who investigated Bernie madoff's Operation Pets

491
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Clients

492
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
The way she

493
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
Fugazi there

494
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Account statements

495
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,408
There were some instances when the customers got their account statements from a net

496
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
I complained that

497
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,528
Am I you know you promised me

498
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,368
You know 18% and I only got 16%

499
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
The

500
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
Statement back to Annette

501
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Statement

502
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
With miraculously you got the

503
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
Yeah your new statement with the new hire return

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,032
Madoff himself says the accounts of the big four were

505
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Fugazi

506
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
They were doing all sorts of major a praise

507
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
The Jewish term that we use

508
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
12

509
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,552
Taking more sprays and stuff that they did was unbelievable

510
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
And I was doing it to me

511
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
They demanded Bernie do

512
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Kinkier

513
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Maneuvers

514
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,584
Example there was explicit testimony that he would not tolerate

515
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
A single losing trade in his account to he had a particular trading strategy where sometimes

516
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
You can have a losing leg of a trade but the trade is a whole is a winner who's a three-legged trade he wouldn't even tolerate

517
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
For some reason

518
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,112
Every single trade every single leg of every single trade had to be a winner that doesn't happen in real life

519
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,744
And no one can demand that of their money badge room each of the Big 4 pay back Millions

520
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
U-Pick hours case

521
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Billions of dollars

522
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Every one of them

523
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Claim Madoff Hadoop them

524
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
They weren't process

525
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Security

526
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,056
And it's impossible for Schwartz to say for certain

527
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Who knew what

528
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,456
What he can say is there was activity in the accounts of the Big Four

529
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Backwood raise

530
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
Questions in the eyes of

531
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
Anyone now you might believe

532
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
That your Genius money manager

533
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
Can get you 700% return and a good year

534
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
But

535
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
No one has the ability to rewrite history

536
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Entering stocks into bonds

537
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,960
And so these men mostly older powerful mentors to Madoff

538
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,056
Open for me a new door into the Madoff Ponzi operation

539
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
They gave Bernie his break

540
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
And then demanded that he provide them things he couldn't honestly achieve

541
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,856
These people are these people who are

542
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Everett is

543
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
They are asking for things that are not

544
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Possible

545
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
Bernie is accomplishing those things

546
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
So now ask yourself who has the power in that relationship

547
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,680
Is it barely because he knows he's doing illegal things for these parties

548
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Or is it the

549
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,800
The party who said who's now making Bernie do illegal things

550
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,640
It's both of them but when burning since you gosh like

551
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,992
I I discovered that people are really greedy

552
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Member that was in the beginning

553
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,368
Is this what he means that these people were using him

554
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,952
This is what their name means end and Bernie has actually

555
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
Particular enmity for those big 4

556
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
One of them jeffry picower

557
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
Cook-Out 7 billion dollars

558
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,008
It's getting billion dollars from this eating right beyond what he invested

559
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,616
That's a longhorn who produced the series now the story of jeffry picower

560
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,944
Is one of the more dramatic moments in the series

561
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,600
What's going on

562
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
10 months after Bernie Madoff arrest

563
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
Barbara picower

564
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,072
Wife of Madoff largest investor jeffry picower

565
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
Dial 911

566
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
This call is hard to listen to It's upsetting

567
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,432
Okay Samurai

568
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,904
Actor Jeremy pick out had a heart attack and drown you can congratulate me on that

569
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
According to Madoff

570
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,048
The fort picower went for his final swim

571
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Bernie phone him

572
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
I called up

573
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
Jeffry picower and

574
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
You know I said

575
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,032
EB got to give the money back I said you guys

576
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Only money

577
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
And I want the money back

578
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
Picower that you know that the well you know I don't have it all I thought I said Jeffrey

579
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
I know that you have the money there

580
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,344
If you work 9 billion dollars that I want

581
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
7 billion back

582
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
Consider what made of

583
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,256
Regarding the death of someone

584
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
What this says about Bernie Madoff

585
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Who he is

586
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Whenever someone hears that I interviewed Madoff

587
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
They always want to know this Bernie feel remorse

588
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,872
I'd interviewed serial killers child rapists

589
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
People considered monsters

590
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
I suspended judgment

591
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
I want to hear their stories

592
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
To understand them

593
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
This doesn't mean I wasn't horrified by what I heard

594
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
But I try to see the world through their eyes

595
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
An exercise in empathy

596
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
At times

597
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
I feel empathy for Bernie

598
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
But here's what struck me about Bernie

599
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
He

600
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Didn't feel empathy

601
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
Declaimed feel remorse

602
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
Now the words but

603
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
There was always a but

604
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
On the phone with me

605
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,720
Every single time Bernie mentions victims

606
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
He can barely get

607
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Through the apology

608
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Before interrupting himself

609
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
They were warned they were greedy

610
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Always this strange

611
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Sorry not sorry

612
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
I could go crazy and do something stupid

613
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
It's Joey if you want it

614
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
So put your money in

615
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,160
It's impossible to tell the story of The Fall of the House of Madoff

616
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
Without understanding that there were real

617
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
Real suffering

618
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,840
Back in early 2009

619
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,168
Victims were telling stories of their ruined lives

620
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
On TV on the radio

621
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:54,336
On every local talk show it was the worst thing that ever happened to us

622
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,736
This can't be real we have lost everything I've lost everything and you've lost everything everything

623
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:07,136
That we work for you down the green

624
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,208
X at the end of the month I

625
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
I made a lot of money for a lot of people

626
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Did you catch

627
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
What's the remorse

628
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
Or was it too fleeting to register in your brain

629
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,808
My producers and I were in touch with dozens of victims

630
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
To the victims

631
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Bernie's indifference was enraging

632
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
All over again

633
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
But it wasn't the slightest bit surprising

634
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
What is surprising

635
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Is what happened to victims

636
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,448
Since Madoff drag their 65 billion dollars

637
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Down a dark

638
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Call

639
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,336
I mean there is now this is a 9 years later

640
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
There is any

641
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,200
Industry that is created around the Madoff collapse

642
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
There

643
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,296
Hundreds of lawyers working on

644
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Recovering money

645
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,672
And that's a very complicated story and and

646
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
When we trying tell because you know what

647
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
A lot of people who lost money

648
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:24,192
Didn't have any inclination couldn't have had any inkling that this was going on

649
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
The Justice group comes in

650
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
Private lawyers

651
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
Courts judges the justice department

652
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
And they try to make amends

653
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Holiday

654
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,992
Justice is a very complicated issue in

655
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,552
The universe created by Bernie Madoff

656
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,648
You have a trustee appointed to recover

657
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Funds for victims

658
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
Well some of those funds

659
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Little people

660
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,816
Who took those funds

661
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
In good faith

662
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
They given Bernie

663
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Millions of dollars they took out

664
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
1000000 + 1

665
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,056
And so they thought they were doing the right thing they thought it was

666
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Their money

667
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,384
But we got to get money back to the people

668
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,480
Who lost more money than they put in you're going to have to

669
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,088
Give some of your money to them so it's a very complicated Marvel Universe

670
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,672
Well there's the individuals and then in the last category

671
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
There are the banks

672
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
And the investment institutions

673
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
That

674
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Bernie

675
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
Two ordinary people all over the world

676
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
Yeah there are these financial institution

677
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Hedge funds raised

678
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,288
Billions of dollars to come to Latin America

679
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Europe

680
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,104
All across the United States

681
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Marketing

682
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Bernie Madoff

683
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,992
As a safe bet you know he was weaponized

684
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
By the financial system

685
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,088
And so we wondered why worth

686
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,648
Those hedge funds accountable

687
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
For not doing their job

688
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
And this is the still

689
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
Still happening still

690
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,584
Unraveling still needs to be reported part of the

691
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Storytime solutely

692
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
That question

693
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
About why the people who

694
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,920
Quote weaponized Bernie Madoff haven't been punished yet probably will never be punished

695
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,040
That is something that Eleanor Nancy fish and tackle in the final episode in their series

696
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
