1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,344
Relative if you can remind your mind back to a time when your life wasn't dominated by Alan Funt and Candy Camera like how did

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
How does it start

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
So I first

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
A lot of

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,256
People I did not grow up watching candid

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
Camera I never heard of Candy Camera

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,888
Candid Camera

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,984
Have you heard of The Declaration of Independence that ring any bells

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
No

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
Actually no no BS

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
A founding father

15
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Of a difference

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,624
Hey I'm Jared Radiolab when you least expect it

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,976
You're expected today

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,768
Time in r

19
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,352
Media history we're like the line between show and life

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Was really clear

21
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Then Along came a guy named Alan Funt who muddy that line in a way that was fascinating but

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
Fakta spiritual

23
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
I think those bite marks around all of our butts

24
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
So check your tush

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
And listen to the story for my producer lattof

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
First heard about Kenny camera few years ago and I when I did I just

27
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
Dovinh

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Like I just

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Binged

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,232
All of I I watched every single clip I go again

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
And then that's around the time when I found out that it's

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,400
Started as a radio show which was even more interesting to me because I was like

33
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
A Rios

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
How does that even make

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
What is that even what would that be

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
So I called up one of the

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
Few people who have

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Studied

39
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
That's right

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
So I'm Jacob Smith an associate professor at Northwestern University School of communication and the director of

41
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
Northwestern's Masters in sound arts and industries

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
Kind of wonderful kind of creepy backs

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
You just want to start with

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
World War II

45
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Yeah

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
So during what war was working in the signal Corps

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
The electronic communications

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Sperm for the Armed Forces at a time

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,712
So fun teaser a few years out of college by this point he is stationed in Oklahoma at Camp Gruber

50
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
And his job there is to make

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
RadioShack

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
For the Armed Forces Radio one of these

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
The grape grape grape

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Basically the show

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Burnt wood gets old

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
You're stationed at the camp to come into His Studio

57
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
And talk about their gripes

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
Barracks in about the food in about you know their girlfriend is cheating on him back home or whatever you know things that were bothering

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
Not a very good idea for morale

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,480
Oh I think it's a great idea from around really good if I would imagine it would bring the soldiers down

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Together

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Fair enough

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
Anyhow so he's bringing these soldiers into a little recordings

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,720
Studio one of the things that he found with it as soon as the red light would go on

65
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
To indicate that recording was going on

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
They clam up

67
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
They would get tongue tied

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
Mike fright micro

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,056
Mike fry in any tells me stories about how it was amazing to see these soldiers

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Who would go out in the battle

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Without maybe blinking an eye but

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Break into a cold sweat

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
At the thought of sitting in front of Michael

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,856
So what was what does he do also disconnect the red light

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
And record them secretly

76
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
So basically you bring them in and say okay let's just do a practice round let's just talk over the things the kind of things you will talk about

77
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
And then

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
When then finally they were ready to start I already got it

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
He would get better material

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
When they didn't know they were being recorded

81
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
Would they be okay with that likes will you just collect mission after work

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
20 more

83
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
It's a sort of Truth deferred

84
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,600
You might say but according to Jacob Smith front was like

85
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
This is a

86
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,256
Great trick yes you know the red light goes off in the great Booth but a red light goes on infant's mind

87
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
And so after the war he pitches this idea as candid microphone

88
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
Which goes on the air on ABC in 1947

89
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
This is Sonny Fox

90
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
And he was one of the original guys to work with Alan

91
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Microphone

92
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
I can eat just so happy

93
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
When he came into our

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Studio we manage

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Him on

96
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Power

97
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Can you hear me

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
I can't. That is tepid water

99
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Tepid water and I'm sorry the water snot

100
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Up to Snuff

101
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Why is my

102
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Hot water now all of a sudden not so driven would have helped

103
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Alright okay we're here to talk about much more exciting

104
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
So when you were working with Al-Anon candid microphone

105
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
What was he like how did you see him like

106
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
Adam is a very able very bright

107
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Young guy at

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
I had a face of an Everyman

109
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
These big chipmunk cheeks

110
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Stratus shorten a little plump

111
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Covers about 5

112
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
10

113
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
And you could

114
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Charm U when he wanted to

115
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Xiaomi right out of your shoes

116
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,231
Or he could be overwrought

117
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Amy had this huge

118
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
Tony says when they were just starting to show sometimes Alan would get so mad

119
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
It's like spring pencils another producer

120
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Weather only four of us and II

121
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
That was it

122
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
That was the core of what we did

123
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
I will have to do everything

124
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:18,367
How long was the Arbiter obviously of whether we did something that didn't just have these two what was like what was the goal

125
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Nicole was too and I wish to reflect

126
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
People

127
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
SAR

128
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
In their unguarded

129
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
We try to bring you the Real McCoy on can the microphone that's the beauty of everyday

130
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
We go out to the studio in the world everyday life

131
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
Sociologist Erving Goffman called bugging the backstage

132
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,527
What we would do is everyday sunny and crew would go to their office in Manhattan

133
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
2 room office

134
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Jidenna

135
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
I think up ideas

136
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Separately scratching our heads

137
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
What about this

138
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Barber shop or a magazine

139
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Maybe that's something we could

140
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
You know

141
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
Restaurant shoe store

142
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,127
So what they do is they take this big clunky portable recorder

143
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,455
It was like a suitcase it wait I think maybe

144
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
60 lb but they put a handle on top

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Opposite of supporter

146
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,135
He says that they would lug around this massive suitcase

147
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Do whatever it was a recording

148
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
And they try to hide it

149
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
So that no one would see it so they could record this

150
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,471
In all these different locations including the women's bathroom

151
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
I really don't

152
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Vinyl

153
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,151
The teeth they gathered front was disappointed to discover that was the most uninteresting

154
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Garbage you could imagine it was

155
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
Frustrating it doesn't have you know the nice shape

156
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
The rise and fall

157
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Climax

158
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
That I'm is going to keep listeners hook now

159
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
That presented us with any problem

160
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Better half hour show

161
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
But they needed to fill

162
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
His house

163
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Desperate I was I was having a date

164
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
First date with a young woman

165
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
I bugged my car

166
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
And try to see how she would sound on a first date

167
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
She found out about that was not amusing that was the last

168
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
How did it go though it was not virgin

169
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Desperate to get stuff

170
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
It's unlikely things

171
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
So here they had this show that was supposed to be about real people real talk everyday conversation but turned out that

172
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,399
So then the question became how can we mix it up how can we Stir It Up how can we

173
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
Change this into something more spectacular

174
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,543
And that's when Alan Funt added a little

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
It's something that Jacob Smith

176
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
It's called I was calling at the Rio

177
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,575
Instead of just letting people Yammer on which didn't seem to work

178
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
You got to get in there

179
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
You got e-juice the action

180
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,999
To get that right shape the man with a hidden Mike had a good one when he dropped

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Mike is like his

182
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Strange situation

183
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,191
She would go into a tailor shop with a microphone up his

184
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Please

185
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:18,335
And he would ask the guy

186
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,503
Oh you can handle like here's another one play the moaning Trump this is Sony's

187
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
He says that

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
One day they called remover

189
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
To come over to their office

190
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
And inside the trunk the Hoover didn't know this was a guy

191
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
And his job was to

192
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Sound Erie

193
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
2 basically mon every time to move or tried to move that trunk

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Just be very gentle weather

195
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
What is it

196
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Nvm just just take it

197
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
Resume supplies I want to know

198
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Christmas begin

199
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm laughing now

200
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Give us a slip

201
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
20 minutes

202
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
I'm going to have a signature that delivered that I won't have signal time

203
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,887
Avocado such great mother

204
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Fralin

205
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
What's getting people into situations where they were frustrated.

206
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
What kind of noise

207
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
There's no noise you don't hear anything

208
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
Come on. We've been waiting since last night

209
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,831
This thing out of here and just keeps going and going and going

210
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,999
Good morning what it is just driving them nuts

211
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
Until finally

212
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Is your $20 they look for another truck

213
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
They lose their temper

214
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
Choose music

215
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
And that

216
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
The climax

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
That's the

218
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Closure now the whole thing has a shape

219
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
It it starts slow and then

220
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,879
Crescendo Crescendo crescendo boobies inventing this new kind a new format of

221
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Entertainment

222
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
It's totally obvious

223
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
But this is

224
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Basically like

225
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Reality TV in a nut

226
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Like

227
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
This is one of the first time

228
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
Where you have that familiar hybrid of of this

229
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
Highly artificial and constructed situation

230
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Within inside of it snippet of life

231
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
We've all been there

232
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,687
Situations where we've been frustrated when we don't understand what's going on

233
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Situations where we bewildered

234
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
So what would start pushing

235
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
Tweaking it changing it trying out new permutations and sometimes

236
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
It's very much like a fly on the wall

237
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Another these days

238
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
I'm kind of poignant

239
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Segments

240
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Of listening to

241
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
, time to get up

242
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
A wife trying to wake up her

243
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
15 minutes

244
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Alright I am beautiful

245
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Temperature Matt guilty so intimate

246
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,247
Is what so incredible

247
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
In this one forgot the white to be in on the go

248
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Come on darling

249
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Just leave me alone

250
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Would you please get up

251
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Go away

252
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Tom

253
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
How do I get to take a shower

254
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
You go get lost

255
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,359
I don't like you talking to me that way once and for all I am six

256
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
What do you mean

257
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Very nice

258
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
So you know you get this

259
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Is beautiful backstage

260
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Glimpse of everyday life

261
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
But

262
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Where do we stop

263
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
And obviously it did prompt

264
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Let her stuff you hisses and catcalls

265
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
Have you heard the one where I was just listening to it the other day where

266
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
We're listening write in to complain about that one

267
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Yeah yeah that was actually cool yeah you tell us tell us about it well so

268
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
A few well-chosen ones that really made out of

269
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
She's writing in to complain that this was in a crossing a line

270
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,135
So what font does is he goes up to her door to talk to her

271
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
But it goes with a hidden mic

272
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
I wonder if I could have

273
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Couple minutes of your time

274
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Is that alright

275
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
The other day about one of our programs call a candid microphone

276
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
And I got it from your letter that you don't like it very much

277
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
No I don't

278
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,383
Fallout what are some of the things you find objects

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Well I don't like it because I think it's snooping

280
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Avenal prison

281
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Out and out

282
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Snooping

283
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
In your letter you said

284
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,023
Is that a little more strongly you said you thought were a bunch of dirty sneaking spy

285
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Well

286
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
I suppose that the time and I was listening to the program I felt that way

287
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,055
Look at these people in their homes extemporaneously about the

288
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
What was it that you went into Sandman bedroom

289
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,759
Oh you mean the one where the wife awake in the house

290
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
We didn't know we were talking for speaking for the public. Started put him in a bad light

291
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,511
Why you may have something there but don't you think it's funny that sounds a man makes when he awakens

292
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,167
They're funny but they're only for him though in his own bedroom and I'm sure he doesn't enjoy having the whole world know about it

293
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
What you think most people are nervous and self-conscious in front of them

294
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,895
Not anymore I think most people text you a microphone very nicely

295
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,551
You said you talked to us about the same way if you know you know you were talking about microphone right now

296
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
Aveeno different

297
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Let me show you this is

298
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
And what you just said is

299
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Is ready to go out

300
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
From coast to coast is that make any difference

301
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
Faint dead away am I not coming in here and talk to you

302
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
I think so at the moment

303
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,735
This conversation may not be worth a nickel but would you like to have it on the air

304
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,975
Because I want the whole world to know

305
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
I miss 7

306
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,703
Oh my God that's amazing she just switched actually nnn you can hear in her voice.

307
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
Right I have this one adviser her name is

308
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
Is Jill Lepore she have this idea bastardizing it but

309
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
To put it crudely like we all kind of have these

310
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
To drive

311
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735

Privacy

314
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
We

315
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Don't

316
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,135
Want people in our bedrooms listening to us that is

317
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159

Christina

319
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
And then on the other hand we have

320
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Disk drive for

321
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Publicist

322
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
It's exciting

323
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Exciting to have

324
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
People pay attention to

325
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,215
And these two drives to drive for privacy in the Drive-Thru

326
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Publicity are sort of

327
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Competing in a

328
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
Two coming up that tension

329
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Well just takes off

And I request

341
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
For those of you who

342
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

343

Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

345
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
It just means you lean back and say

346
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Maybe it was the moment that I

347
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,735
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

348
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Or maybe the kid was a piano

349
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,391
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

350
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Or maybe the kids in math class

351
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,255
Music in the margin of their geometry homework

352
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
We're interested in the

353
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Epic moments where

354
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Kid does something super smart

355
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191

370
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Candid Camera

371
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
Allen Funt in the spring of 1949 the show premieres on NBC

372
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,023
Show it's the exact same from setup weird or frustrating situations try and catch

373
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Reactions

374
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,935
But when the show goes out on TV

375
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
A lot of viewers think that it's mean-spirited

376
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
That the subjects

377
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Being somehow

378
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Mystery that there were critics who were

379
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Very unnerving

380
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,551
Set by there were people certainly do the critics say oh man I made a list

381
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
Tear of

382
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,415
Of a whole bunch of that criticisms from the 40s and 50s

383
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,791
And they're great their likes to know like they're so sweeping so okay so

384
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
So there was this one guy in the New Yorker this is in 1950

385
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Who said and I love this

386
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
For my money

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Candid camera is

388
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Sadistic

389
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Poisonous

390
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Anti-human

391
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
And sneaky

392
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
What year was another

393
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Hold on there is another kind of great

394
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
String of object

395
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
There's so many of

396
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,903
Another guy for different guy from The New Yorker

397
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
He found Alan Funt

398
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Horse

399
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Nagging

400
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Suspicious

401
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
And misanthropic and to make matters worse

402
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
Zestfully cell

403
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
But I mean I think that becomes Canada PR problem that he has to fix

404
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
And according to Jacob

405
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:03,199
It was not a small problem no even all through the 50s

406
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
It's on and off doesn't really get its audience

407
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
It moves around different Networks

408
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,695
And all the while he's tweaking it and changing it adapting it

409
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Early 60s

410
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
She hits on

411
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Second little tweak

412
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
That would make all the difference

413
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Fonts term was

414
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
The reveal

415
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
The reveal

416
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,199
By 1962 he locks it and you start to see this thing happened over and over

417
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:40,831
The end of segment

418
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,391
Classic reveal is let's say

419
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Dad is in a diner and there serving this guy if tiny little teacup

420
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
And he wanted a big coffee mug

421
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,031
Serving the tiny little teacup what's going on

422
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,919
Guy gets pissed off and then previously but would have let that keep going but now

423
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
What is the guy is about to blow

424
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
Punch someone out

425
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
And they kind of grab the guy in their life

426
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
Santa camera

427
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
They show him the hidden camera

428
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
On

429
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Camera and as he's looking at that hidden

430
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
And he's like

431
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Huh

432
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,912
The camera Zooms in on his face

433
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
MMG

434
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
What did actually happen

435
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Cool people in place

436
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,152
It's for that very moment because one of their first reactions are to turn away or to cover their face

437
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,248
So he would sometimes have to physically restrain them and turning them towards the camera

438
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
So they can capture

439
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
That one

440
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Weeding

441
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Moment

442
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
And in that moment you see so much on their face they're they're angry they're embarrassed or ashamed of confused

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
You don't know how to feel a tendon

444
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Right that moment

445
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Fun says

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
The magic word

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
You're on Candid Camera

448
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
And it's all everything's everything is that okay

449
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Where is the where you least expected

450
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,944
Addicted you're the star today

451
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Smile

452
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
You're on Candid Camera

453
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,672
Something something Hocus Pocus

454
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
It's your lucky day it went from being like this

455
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
You Alex

456
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
This works

457
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,312
Much better I take it out I was hugely successful it was one of the top-ranked shows from

458
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
Basically all of the early 1960s

459
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
Million different tens of millions of people watched it

460
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
And I think part of the reason why was it

461
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,880
Without that sort of meanness it bled out the meanness and people could now

462
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
What it really was which of these

463
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Kind of a little

464
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
Peepholes into

465
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
Human Nature

466
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
The first one I ever saw was the the elevator sketch

467
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
Do you know the elevators now headed to walk me through the elevator sketch

468
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
It's just really simple

469
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
It's really

470
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
Simple and it's so beautiful

471
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
The gentleman in the elevator now

472
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Is a candid stop

473
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,576
Basic setup is guy walks into an elevator there's a hidden camera

474
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
He doesn't know

475
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648
Is a fella with his hat on

476
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
In the elevator

477
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
He is like everybody else wearing his overcoat and a hat and he stands in the middle of the elevator and then

478
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
All of the other people in the elevator who we later learned hard

479
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Confederate

480
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
They

481
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
They take offense

482
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Take off their hats

483
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
And one by one by one what have up to have top five hats off

484
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,504
Open elevator door in he's just sort of standing there awkwardly and then he just

485
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Assertive

486
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:56,672
Hesitantly is he just takes off his hat and then holds it in front of his you know chess

487
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Maui

488
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
The procedure

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,144
Then all of the people around him they put their hats back on

490
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,472
Anthony started laying around and like it's almost it's

491
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,872
How many of this is somewhere between conscious and subconscious level and then he sort of just puts his hat on

492
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
It's really funny it's really really nice guy wasn't clearly just was trying

493
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,392
To fit in in this weird way it's interesting I never

494
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Watch the T

495
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
But it's weird like we

496
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
When I was 7 we still

497
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
We would say all the time like

498
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
Smile you're on Candid Camera even though I've never seen the show

499
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,776
It was like the idea of the show is like in a way way bigger than the actual show

500
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah, came up but it but it was less about

501
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Kind of

502
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,968
Investigating human behavior and more about

503
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Vanity

504
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
In this weird way it was like this idea that

505
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
You

506
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
Tiny sliver of your private life

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Could be

508
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
Exercised and then broadcast

509
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
To the world

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
And that idea

511
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
That idea would get away from

512
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
Fontaine it would go all over the world and then it would

513
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Come right back and vitamin

514
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
The botanist

515
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Really funny and strange

516
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
What what happened

517
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Well

518
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Okay it starts like this

519
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Hi there

520
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
What's the story with this

521
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Oyana

522
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
Maryland

523
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
The ex-wife of Alan Funt and

524
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,328
Where do you want me to stop over on the plane okay

525
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Newark Airport

526
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
Maryland funds daughter Alan Funt daughter

527
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Juliet's

528
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,264
My mom my dad my baby brother and I are on a fly

529
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
Straight flight to Miami and a half

530
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
So may I don't have any personal recollection of it

531
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Tempered glass

532
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
Ameron flight a largely uneventful flight

533
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
For about the first 20 minutes

534
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
Maybe an hour who knows

535
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
They're about a hundred miles or so offshore and

536
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,400
You know the bathroom all of the sudden

537
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
A man stood up in the back of the flight

538
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
And he took out a knife

539
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Any put it to the throat of the one of the flight attendants and he walked her

540
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
All the way down the center Island

541
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Passing every pass

542
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Easter on the flight

543
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
I did hear noises which were a little bit different

544
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
In the back

545
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
Does Fred Weaver retired Eastern Airlines pilot he was one of the flight crew and next to him

546
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
Circo pilot Lowell Miller they were second breakfast

547
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
You know I hear the knock on the door and I just open the door and I turned around to see who it was there she is

548
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,664
The flight attendant with the hijacker provider with the knife up against your throat

549
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
Shane

550
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,344
Kuba Kuba also was staying that his friend had a bomb in the back of the airplane

551
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
I do write this I said

552
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Here we go

553
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
The stewardess was walking around

554
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
Talking with all the past years asking them if anybody knew how to speak Spanish

555
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
Coach 11 years old at the time I didn't think much of it

556
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Until

557
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
Till the announcement came on the loudspeaker

558
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
Gets on and says ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen we have some gentlemen up here that want to go to Cuba so

559
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
We're going to Havana

560
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,256
And then came the part of the story that I've been told was the waiting

561
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
The

562
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Frozen

563
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Silent

564
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
Staring at each other

565
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Waiting

566
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
But then

567
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
This one woman

568
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
A few rows away begin to recognize my

569
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:09,856
And she began to look and look back and forth to other folks and point a little bit and there was a slow

570
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Building of her certainty

571
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
And then all of a sudden

572
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
And sad

573
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Second we are not

574
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Being hijacked

575
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,520
It's a Candid Camera stunt I'm quoting him

576
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,920
The plane went absolutely crazy

577
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
Pension Thrift off of

578
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
People were lined up with

579
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
There are sickness bags to get autographs from my father

580
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
My dad is

581
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,400
No I know it's not me I'm not involved

582
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
BRB hijack

583
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
And they said come on Allen

584
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,408
We know it's you just trying to persuade people he's not getting any purchase

585
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Behind him

586
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Disease

587
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
A priest

588
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:17,952
He runs over the priest will you please help me convince these people this is not a

589
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,256
Maniac Is For Real

590
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
You can't get me Allen

591
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Are we supposed to see a guy with you by the clerical collar everything

592
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Where is the hijack

593
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,736
Terrifying people up in the cockpit

594
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
But eventually at some point

595
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
He hears this kind of commotion from first-class and so he does open the door and he pokes his head out

596
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
And everybody begins to applaud and applause

597
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,912
We're not totally sure about that last detail might be in Embellishments

598
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Bored

599
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
Seems clear is it around this time Alan Funt

600
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
Starting to feel

601
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
Keeping so successful at

602
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Bugging the back

603
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,624
Messing up the line between private and public in real life in Showbiz

604
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,256
Couldn't when he needed to we couldn't reassert that clearline I was worried

605
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,072
That he was going to come up with some idea to try to

606
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,680
Mitigate this situation and deal with it

607
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
What's he got so frustrated that he decided to just

608
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
Deal with the hijackers himself yes

609
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
So it starts formulating

610
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Plant

611
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
Grab the guy I'm not going to the floor and my mother sang

612
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,880
Playing alone sit down before he's going to be like

613
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:57,024
Apparently the flight attendant had to tell him to sit down what happens now will you have you took it to the point where

614
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,120
Now the plane is landing in what I guess the people in the plane think of

615
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Florida

616
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
People the front of the plane notice Cuba Cuba correct into the terminal what greeted as the plane is

617
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Open to buy Cuban Military Officers

618
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
I saw a Cuban Soldier a gun in his hand and he had bandoliers you know with lots of bullets on him

619
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
Maven Circle the airplane

620
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,160
And it seems at this point everyone on the plane maybe the first time

621
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Would like

622
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Everybody really got it

623
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
But it was a hijacking

624
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
That was finally the reveal

625
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
Just really late

626
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
The Story Goes when they're getting off the plane when he's Cuban soldiers are escorting them off the plane he was standing in his seat

627
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Twisty

628
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Aspective

629
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Human psychology all the passengers were

630
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,272
Filing down the aisle past him he began to take there

631
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Feelings out on him

632
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
And they became angry at

633
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
And each one of them

634
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,024
Had sort of their own grab bag of curses for him as if he had tricked them as if he had

635
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Set them up in some way

636
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,912
Person in that line from to my father and said

637
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Smile my ass

638
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
Magic happens

639
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
Claw my ass was closing remarks

640
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Business

641
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Smile my ass

642
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
Tell me the meaning of this scene

643
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Is that

644
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Here's a man who

645
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,608
He has helped create a situation with people

646
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,216
In some kind of peril don't know if they're in Peril that they've been blinded

647
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,032
By the device that he created

648
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
It's suggest

649
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
It's the beginning of something

650
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
Blurry witch didn't used to be

651
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,760
As much as funny like when I hear that

652
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,112
Plane scene it's like I'm almost nostalgic for that kind of confusion cuz we have now is like

653
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Actually way more confusing I think

654
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah cuz we all have these cameras are always taking these

655
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Candid

656
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
Pictures of ourselves with like

657
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Obviously

658
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:14,240
In series are candid but they're not really candid because we've taken like four of them in the one we choose we put the filter on and

659
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Nowadays

660
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Smith talks about

661
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,408
Is that that's pretty sure Matt kielty and he was her

662
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Turn off mic

663
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Clear hashing this out

664
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Now what

665
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Fun

666
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Look at it

667
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
The faces they make

668
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Poking

669
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Who know their

670
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Did they know

671
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
I'm trying to

672
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Figure out what they

673
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
And how they work

674
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Trying to figure out what part of that post is real

675
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Exact

676
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,736
What he's really saying is that is that everyone who comes and Allen Funt

677
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
End

678
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,088
And the people on the plane like the confusion is trade basic

679
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,744
Like if you're going to go on Facebook when you were little bit of an allen fun if you're going to go on Twitter to do the thing you're producing each other

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Then if you're actually trying to figure out how the other people are reacting to your how you read them or how they're reading you yet

681
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
A little bit like

682
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
You're stuck on the plane cuz you don't know what's real and what show

683
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
In a way

684
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,920
You split an infinitive half as opposed to xiamen and

685
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,504
The audience now everyone is in the showman and the audience

686
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Both Park

687
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,112
It's like I think we're Allen funding ourselves

688
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
Enormous thanks to our producer lots of Nasser also co-producer Matt kielty and a special thanks to
