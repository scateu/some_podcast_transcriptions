00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:06,656
Hey today we re podcasting a show with something extra and update

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,752
This show which we did a couple years back is called patient zero

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
Which took

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
I'll look at

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,408
The origins of things not surprisingly disease but also other things too

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
And you know you're all that

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,784
But I wanted to step in and say that in the middle of the show

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
We're going to slip from looking back at a disease that

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,928
Started way long time ago 2

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
Examining a disease that meow

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
I speak this happening right now

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
Irish senior editor sternwheeler will bring you that

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
Meantime here's the show

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
Are you awake

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,992
Radio WNYC

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
End NPR

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
So we said where we are

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
Starting as off today or are producers Lynn Levy and Sean Cole

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Very pretty day to be on abandoned Island where

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Victims of contagious disease were quarantined

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
And

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
One in particular

23
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
Lived here died here never believing that she was in fact

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Sick

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
And dangerous

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,832
So this is a story that begins where it starts in 1906

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
It doesn't start on the island that starts in Oyster Bay

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Nice neighbors very nice

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
There was this one rich

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Family

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
On vacation there and their daughter

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Get sick

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Get sick for

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,168
This is Judy Levitt Ima

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,752
Professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,848
And she wrote a book about the story so basically the girl the daughter has a fever

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Then her sister comes down with it

38
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Their mom

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
The maid

40
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528
About 6 out of 11 in the family get sick

41
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And with this disease the fever

42
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,160
The first part of it both diarrhea or constipation or reported

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
So it can go either way I guess

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
What is it

45
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Typhoid

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
And they couldn't figure out what could cause that

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Did you see so they called in the sanitary engineer named George Soper with the public health department he was the go-to guy for outbreaks

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
Like this back in the Department of Public Health

49
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
Thinking you know what you get sick because of

50
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,712
Something dirty near you being in the well or in the pipe

51
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah so he looks into all of that

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Did a hole

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Test on the house in the water and everything couldn't find anything is so start stalking the family and he

54
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
He started quizzing them all and they

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
Eventually

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
He builds up this

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Full picture

58
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Of of

59
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Several outbreaks

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
Going back year Mamaroneck

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
A New York family had a house for the store 1902 Dark Harbor Maine

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,760
Autumn 1906 winter 1907 New York City all these cases and they all had one thing in common

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
What eats

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Of these families

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
Had employed the same

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Cook

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Which is

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Funny

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Because when you cook food

70
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,888
You kill the bacteria in the food

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
But this cook her most famous

72
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
Dish was Peach Melba

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Which is ice cream and fresh peaches

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
Fresh peaches

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Raw fruit

76
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
As a perfect medium and The Cook's name

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Was Mary Mallon

78
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
Mary Mary Mary II charcoal

79
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
Typhoid Mary so we're talking about no you don't know this

80
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Everybody thinks they know this

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,632
Story and then when I looked into the first thing about it and when you look into the details

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,728
They tell us some very difficult things about who we

83
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
War

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
And

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
You still are in a lot of ways it's all in the details all of the juice and problem like in like this like this

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Like a peach

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
I remember college

88
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
This is Radiolab

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
And in this hour a series of stories

90
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
They're all here that delicious

91
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Story

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Archetype we call

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Patient

94
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Europe the first

95
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
Will try to trace

96
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Ideas and Trends in massive

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Social

98
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Traumas like pandemic

99
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Back to that one

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
Purse or one critter

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
For if you didn't have this thing but for this thing you wouldn't have the rest of those I like the butt for the butt for

102
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
But

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Meanwhile back to the pizzas

104
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
So

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
George slippers like I've got to find this woman

106
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
And

107
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
When he finds her she's in New York

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543
Looking for another family but water has had recently been taken to the Presbyterian hospital with typhoid fever this is from an article

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,407
Call Super Bowl called The Curious Case of Typhoid Mary lovely daughter

110
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Was dying

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
So he goes to the house

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
Walks into the kitchen

113
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
Cease this women 5

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Butt sex

115
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Blonde hair

116
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Blue eyes have a good figure and might have been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy Irish immigrant 36 years old

117
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
Told not particularly clean and he says Mary Mallon I think you are causing disease in people and

118
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
I want

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
Samples of your urine feces and blood

120
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Good afternoon

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
And she says what are you accusing me of being sick

122
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
Play the role of Mary is Columbia Public Health

123
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
How dare you I'm not a sick person they should do

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
What racism out of the building

125
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
With a fork in her hand a serving Fork

126
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
A serving for you

127
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
I felt rather lucky to escape

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
But does she have type

129
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Achieve

130
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
How would we have time

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
That's the thing

132
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
She never had any symptoms

133
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
She felt perfectly healthy

134
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
She was actually

135
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
The first

136
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
Documented case in North America

137
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Of

138
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
A healthy carrier

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Wishes to say someone who has the disease

140
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Is and is contagious

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
But never

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Actually feels

143
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
The symptoms of symptoms

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
In one weird way super

145
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Real but he's only read about

146
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
And then here she is in front of them

147
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
But

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,655
Think of how all this must have sounded the Mary I mean some guy from outer space

149
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Comes into your kitchen

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
And says your disease

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
And you're hurting people

152
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Why do I feel fine I'm living a moral life I'm not a

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Vagrant unemployed

154
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
I'm a good

155
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Solid citizen

156
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
Be traced to what you eating today probably grab your knife

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
What does he have any evidence of the

158
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
She is spreading disease not yet that's why he needs

159
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Poop

160
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
So he goes back

161
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Find her at a rooming house

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,423
Amounts where it's at in and then the health department

163
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
This female doctor s Josephine Baker

164
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
Maybe she could ask for blood

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,687
PC said here in a little more jet I need to know how you ask her that she tries

166
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,063
And when it doesn't work she comes back a little bit later with cops and they come to the house and

167
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Mary Mallon

168
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
When she realizes what's happening

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Disappears

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Flaming disappears

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
Completely vanishes

172
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
They end up

173
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Searching the entire place

174
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
And I can't find her

175
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,519
Finally I think they're about to leave when one of them spots

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Skirt at coming outside of a door

177
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
It's a little piece of calico

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Kind of

179
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Stuck in a

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Doorway open the door in their shoes and so they dragged her out and she

181
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Comes out kicking and screaming and

182
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,119
I get her the amulets of Josephine Baker sits on her according to her

183
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
It's on her and Baker later said something like it was like being in a cage with an angry lion

184
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,639
So they take her to the hospital they tested her feces and urine

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
And they found that yes she was in fact

186
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
A carrier

187
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Of

188
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Live typhoid

189
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
The weird Island that's been awhile on him

190
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,119
So they isolate her and they ultimately move her

191
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
From Manhattan to North brother Island

192
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,543
Have a good of a haunted by

193
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
And there she is

194
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Thanks man

195
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
We went there to

196
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Justed

197
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
How to get our heads around what

198
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Must have

199
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Thought

200
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
What was yelling like

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
And everything is

202
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Wheatley overgrown it was really creepy

203
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
PP because it was in such

204
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Dissolution yeah yeah

205
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Be careful where you step and went in there all of these medical former medical building including a giant

206
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
Hospital where they isolated tuberculosis patients

207
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Big brick

208
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Stately building

209
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
None of the other side of the island

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
They're smaller

211
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Wooden building

212
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Crush

213
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Maybe we're

214
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Wearher

215
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Cottage

216
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,575
Would be if it was still standing but it's not standing anymore

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Well it was one room one room

218
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
I had a kitchen

219
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Rattata

220
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
I guess it's sleeping area and a sitting area

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
It probably wasn't so bad

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
If you didn't have to

223
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
To stay there

224
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
You know any places that you're not free to leave

225
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Becomes like a prison

226
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
So we're marching around and then lenses to me

227
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Hey look at the view

228
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
And

229
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Holy moly

230
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
It's right there

231
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
That's when it really hit me

232
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
If this is where her cabin was

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Then one window of it

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Looked exactly on to Manhattan

235
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
You could have seen where she

236
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Used to live

237
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
You can see the

238
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Traffic on the

239
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Streets

240
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
This was like

241
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
The most horrible Seaside vacation

242
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Almost the whole time they had her incarcerated

243
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Did they took

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Feces 3 times a week

245
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
Which is you know it's not pleasant to have to

246
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Do that

247
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
And

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
Sometimes she was negative and sometimes she was Posse

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Wait

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
What

251
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
That's that's another thing that they

252
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Figuring out of the X 2

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
She was probably

254
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
An intermittent

255
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
What is that mean

256
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
The disease is always in her

257
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
But sometimes she excretes it and sometimes she doesn't

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Of them has been confusing

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
When I first came here I was so nervous and almost prostrated with

260
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Grief and trouble

261
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
My eyes begin

262
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
This is from a letter that Mary wrote

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
From the island I have in fact

264
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Peep show

265
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
For everybody

266
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
But if you keep reading it and in fact is addressed to a lawyer it's clear that she was fighting this and she have been sending her

267
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Her own feces samples herself

268
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
Do a private lab in Manhattan

269
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
And each one of those was an egg

270
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
Negative tuberculosis man would say

271
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
There she is

272
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
The kidnapped

273
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Yeah that is poisonous

274
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Shih Tzus the city

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
And losses

276
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Still there all these questions as to whether any of this

277
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
Does legal mean even George super the guy who hunted her down said

278
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
It was contrary to the Constitution of the United States to hold her under the

279
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
How long was she on this island

280
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
3 years

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
And then

282
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
What changed

283
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Was

284
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
New health commissioner

285
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
And so he says it's just not right that we keep a healthy woman locked

286
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
She was not dangerous to anybody if she didn't cook

287
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
He lets her go

288
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Back to Manhattan

289
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,247
But he makes a promise she did promise you signed an affidavit saying

290
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
She'll never cook

291
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
She was released

292
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
They gave they bathed set her up with a job as a laundress and they weren't here you go Mary

293
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
And then you know

294
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
They kept track of her for a while

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
And then at a certain point they kind of

296
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Stop

297
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
So how many years will go by

298
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
5

299
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
5

300
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
What happens next

301
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
There's an outbreak of typhoid

302
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
Where we are at a maternity hospital you're kidding

303
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Ambulance before

304
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
She says that she goes and pays a visit

305
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
And walks into the kitchen and

306
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
She says the first

307
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Person that she encountered

308
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Was Typhoid Mary Mack

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Your topper did some legwork on

310
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,287
Where Mary had been and it turned out she had worked at a restaurant

311
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
New hotels in in

312
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
And a sanatorium as well as the

313
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
And at least according

314
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
To his account

315
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Two of the

316
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
People that she made sick

317
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
We're children

318
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
She was now a woman who could not claim innocence she was no willfully and deliberately to have taken desperate Chan

319
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Dances with human life cheat abused her privilege

320
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
She's broken her parole so then they put her back on North brother Island back in her

321
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Bungalow

322
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
And there she sits

323
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
She was a dangerous character and must

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Be treated according

325
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Absolutely

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
Oakbrook

327
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
She's made a deal and she didn't keep the deal

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
The thing is is that

329
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
At the time she was sent back

330
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
To the island

331
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,927
There were hundreds of other healthy carriers identified all over New York

332
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
And some of them work

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
What is mostly men

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
By the way and if you're cooking

335
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
Weather report from cooking but not all of them always listen

336
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
And yet Mary was the only one

337
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Who they isolated

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
In this way why

339
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Why only her

340
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
I think it was more about

341
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Making people feel safe

342
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Then

343
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Actually making them safe

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
The lookout for the stair South humbled

345
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
She was what we needed at the time

346
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
We're in the hospital

347
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
Where the tuberculosis patients were quarantined

348
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
This was towards the end

349
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Of linen life is at

350
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
The island

351
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
Yeah these must be the words

352
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Yeah

353
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Sewing machine

354
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
This is where they brought her

355
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
After she had a stroke

356
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
And this is where she was for the last

357
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
6 years of her life

358
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Did she die in here

359
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,615
Hi this is David roster

360
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Radiolab is funded in

361
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,039
Park by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public

362
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
Technology in the modern world more information about Sloan at www. Sloan.

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Radiolab

364
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
Just by WNYC and distributed by NPR

365
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
Okay that's it thanks bye

366
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,959
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

367
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,079
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

368
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

369
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those

370
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
When a kid you know did something that just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

371
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,167
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

372
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,823
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

373
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,943
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

374
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

375
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,439
Doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

376
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,815
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

377
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,143
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

378
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Thank you so much

379
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,599
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert Coolidge this is Radiolab today it's patient zero

380
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Yeah and end this next story

381
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,047
What's it's so huge it's the ultimate patient zero story really many of us have lived through this it was its

382
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Is recent an event

383
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
It's such a recent event that it still hurts and it still bleeds

384
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
I mean it somewhere is

385
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
A literally

386
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
The the patient that is

387
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Cold zero

388
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,919
So this is a lot of people going to help us tell the story but starting ass off

389
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Is

390
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
Science writer Radiolab regular Carl Zimmer

391
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
7 in 1981

392
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
Doctors for the first time described syndrome

393
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Actual man

394
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
The young man in Los Angeles

395
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
Paradigm the number of cases has been growing faster and faster

396
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
So far more than 80 Americans have died 258 people have died 625 people have died

397
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
Of course this is the part we all know how

398
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
From the first few cases in La AIDS became

399
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
One of the deadliest pandemics the world has ever seen more dangerous than the plague of the Middle Ages

400
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Story

401
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
But I've not been able to shake the last 30 years and it's a story

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
I want to reimagine right now

403
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Right after

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
News of this

405
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,423
Syndrome started to break at science writer David quammen who along with Carl will be one of her

406
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
Epidemiologist were trying to figure out

407
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Where did it come from

408
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
And they were thinking like well maybe it's a sexually transmitted disease the CDC launches the study of a group

409
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Group of about

410
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
30 patient

411
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Gay men in New York Los Angeles and San Francisco

412
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
To see who had had sexual contact

413
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
With whom how do you detach a series of interviews with

414
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
Pick me up please name all the people that you that you

415
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Subway

416
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,375
The CDC eventually releases the results of the survey in the form of a

417
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Diagram

418
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,287
With circles representing patients in the lines representing sexual contact in each patient

419
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
Diesel circle with numbered New York

420
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
7 Los Angeles

421
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,943
12z to know who's who but you could tell immediately

422
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
When you look at this

423
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Level 30 or so circles in a circle

424
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
It was special

425
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
Headlines coming out in every direction

426
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,975
Seven or eight emanating from him let the Hub of a wheel

427
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,095
Except all the spokes on this wheel connected to other Wheels would send shout out and catch the other Wheels

428
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,447
Spanning outward at the center of it all was that one little circle number

429
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
0

430
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
Number zero

431
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
As far as we know that was the first time

432
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Do you ever get the term

433
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Patient

434
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
0

435
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Patient zero was

436
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
Central victim and victim

437
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,319
This is from a 60 Minute special in 1988 that year

438
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,159
A reporter named Randy Schultz has written a book called and the band played on

439
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,463
For the first time revealed the identity

440
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
A patient zero

441
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
He was a French Canadian

442
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
A very handsome Airline

443
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
Stewart

444
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,775
Few minutes later in the report Schultz comes on to describe a guy

445
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Unlimited sexual

446
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
The sexual athlete who would fly from one hotspot to the next cuz it's job

447
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
Having sex with literally thousands of men

448
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
And as he knew he was dying

449
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
At least according to Randy Shield

450
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
He became somewhat Sinister and malicious

451
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
He would sleep with a male partner

452
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
At a bathhouse in Sanford

453
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Store somewhere else

454
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
And then when the light came up according to Randy Schultz he would say

455
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
I've got gay cancer

456
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Now you're going to get it too

457
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
I talked to him

458
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Mrs. dr. Selma dritz

459
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
She was part of that CDC study

460
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
He was getting other people sick with it and he said

461
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
My right to do whatever I want

462
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Buy civil rights

463
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Suicide please

464
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
I've got it why shouldn't they have

465
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,719
This is you can kill yourself you want to be cut no right to take somebody else along with you

466
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Screw you and walked out

467
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Really

468
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Chilling

469
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Moment

470
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
I'm pretty much from that moment on

471
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
Hindu god he just took on this this aura

472
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
As says single-handedly causing a an epidemic

473
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
In the United States

474
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
Not invite you but I first bumped into the story in the movie version of in the band played on

475
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Thousands of men

476
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
Was faces I cannot even remember anyone that's an actor playing getting a gun movie now when I first saw that

477
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
Is it already infected two and a half million people into think

478
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Did it all go back

479
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Just seemed

480
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,544
Unreal it was a it was a very potent story there's no doubt

481
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
And then he gave HIV to a lot of people

482
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
There's no question about that

483
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,760
What we do know is that he was not page

484
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
It was not

485
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
No he was not the beginning point

486
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
He was

487
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Not even close

488
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
So here's a question that got me started

489
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Story

490
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,608
Okay so the gay store that was the movie stuck in my head but what's the real movie

491
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
What movie can we make about

492
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
The beginning of the 8th

493
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
You've got something so vast

494
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,848
According to some estimates will have killed 60 million people by the end of the decade

495
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
What you need to beginning

496
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
You need some way of explaining how this

497
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Zas

498
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Easter happened

499
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
What might happen again

500
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,208
How exactly do we know that getting to that wasn't page

501
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,304
Well there are a couple reasons we know it so

502
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
So one thing that people started to do

503
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Scientist was

504
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
Two started going back and looking at people who died who died mysteriously AIDS like things

505
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,152
In the past might some of them have been early cases and they started finding

506
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
A lot 12 years

507
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
Before it was recognized in this country in 1959

508
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
A sailor and Britain

509
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Died of pneumocystis

510
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,696
Pneumonia and soap for a while you had all these new patient zero

511
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
A nurse in Chicago Died of kaposi sarcoma

512
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,560
But the real definitive

513
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,656
Blow to this old patient zero nonsense came by actually looking at the virus

514
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
It's out in 1984

515
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Same here that getting to God die

516
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Scientist isolate the virus

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
HIV

518
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
Which is really just a little string of

519
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,456
Genetic code that gets into your body and into your cells and uses your cells

520
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Make copies of

521
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
But here's the thing when it replicates within a single patient

522
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
It copies itself

523
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
Imprecisely

524
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
It mutates

525
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
Quickly it changes a lot as the virus duplicates itself inside a person that

526
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,704
Often have little copying errors in the movie Temptations

527
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
It turns out those errors

528
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
They happened at a predictable rate you can

529
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
Kind of almost predict how many you're going to see a year or 5 years

530
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,992
And so the amount of changes that you see out there the diverse

531
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
Really of the viruses in the eighth population

532
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
Will that becomes really good information is there a group of scientists begin to look at the amount of diversity

533
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:03,840
HIV patients in the US and other parts of the world and the more diversity the longer the virus has been around

534
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Naked use that kind of like a clock

535
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
If you have a virus here in a virus there you can measure how different they are and you would know that it would take a certain amount of time for

536
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Them to get that different

537
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
To make a long story short the picture they get

538
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
Is the date entered the United States

539
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
Around 1966

540
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,600
At a time when getting to God was still a virginal adolescent

541
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
From their scientists are able to

542
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
The trace the virus

543
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Back to Haiti

544
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
From Haiti

545
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Africa

546
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,168
It's been there the longest it's had the longest time to become diverse to mutate to evolve

547
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
If you want to

548
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Really if you want to get to the

549
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
To the real patients are as it were

550
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
The most interesting stuff come actually come from Africa

551
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,968
It's a one-way to try to figure out its Origins there is to go looking for the virus

552
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
Yep and that takes us back to CR 59

553
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
MTR C60

554
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:03,488
Can we talk about then I'm sure these are the two earliest known HIV positive human stress

555
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
And this is where for me at least

556
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
Story gets way bigger than a man

557
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Now the first sample

558
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
Vr-59 came to light in the late 90s some house scientist on Earth are very old tube of

559
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
Blood from hospital in Kinshasa democratic

560
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Congo

561
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,664
When they tested it and it had HIV

562
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,504
This is been taken from a Bantu man in 1959

563
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
1959

564
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah nobody knows his name nobody even knows I think what he died of

565
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
End

566
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
That was the only one for a number of years that was our one

567
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
Glimpse into the kind of deep history of HIV

568
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,144
Then Along Comes That Guy Michael Warby he's an evolutionary biologist

569
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
At the University of Arizona in a few years ago

570
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,264
Michael went back to Kinshasa and found a second HIV

571
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
Virus lurking in a tiny bit of human tissue

572
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
It was preserved in paraffin wax

573
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Kind of like

574
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Han Solo in in the Star Wars movie when he's kind of Frozen in in that Carbonite or whatever that stuff is

575
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
And this new sample

576
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
He was from the same town Kinshasa is the first and also

577
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Importantly

578
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,048
From the same time 1960

579
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
And with the two of them

580
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Then you can

581
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Kind of go back in time

582
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,960
May be described before you can measure the differences

583
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Between

584
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Calculate

585
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
How long

586
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
It would take for those samples to get that different

587
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
In the end

588
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
You can use these two samples to wind the clock

589
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
All the way back

590
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Virus

591
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
It started it all

592
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,392
It turned out the most recent common ancestor of those two specimen

593
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Goes back

594
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
To do about 1908

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
1908

596
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
That is when it started in human beings

597
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
What

598
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
1908 South Russell

599
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
Give or take a margin of error

600
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Well

601
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
So

602
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
Around 1908 give or take

603
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Something happy

604
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
That moment is this

605
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Spillover

606
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Bill over

607
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,456
Spillovers the term the scientist used

608
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
Describe the moment when

609
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
A virus

610
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
In one species

611
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Passes into another state

612
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
New diseases in humans tend to pop up

613
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
From

614
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Animals

615
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304
So people said okay but flu comes from Birds where does HIV come from

616
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
To get a dancer you have to look Beyond human beings

617
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,704
You have to look at other viruses that are like HIV

618
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,104
How to search was on a similar disease and research animal turns out right about the time that the HIV virus

619
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
Scientists at the New England Primate Research

620
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
Some research has found a virus like it in macaque monkeys monkey it was so similar that they called it SIV

621
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
Simian immunodeficiency virus

622
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
And that's where the origin Quest started

623
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,096
This is Beatrice Han I'm a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania

624
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Interested they founded macaques

625
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,568
It took a couple years and still another primate species to sooty mangabey

626
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
A few more

627
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
The African bring monkeys Mandrill for 40 different species of African monkey

628
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
Known to have their own version of SIV so then the question was which one of these monkeys are primates pasta to us

629
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
Unexpectedly a researcher named Marty Martin Peters decided to test

630
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,888
Her chip to Orphan chimpanzees

631
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,312
She found it very very close match virus that was the closest relative of hiv-1 so everybody's

632
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
Volume

633
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
Open championship

634
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Yes but then the question was

635
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Which

636
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Rather

637
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Where where exactly

638
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,952
So Beatrice Han and her colleagues started looking at chimps that came from different parts

639
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Western central Africa

640
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,560
Now getting blood samples from chimps in the wild

641
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Pretty much

642
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
It just isn't feasible

643
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah because in the wild

644
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,496
They hide the moment they see us so if you get stuck with fecal sample

645
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
The DNA in there

646
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
And viruses

647
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,688
So they would just go to where the chimpanzees sleep at night

648
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
And they would just

649
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,064
You know collection poop bring it back to the lab and Beatrice would analyze all the viruses

650
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
Over 90 different

651
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,976
Wild Community from every part of central Africa over 7000 different people account

652
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,120
And slowly they were able to piece together which communities were infected and which ones have the closest hiv-1

653
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
That's when it hit us for the first time

654
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
What exactly hit you

655
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
The geographic origin of these chumps

656
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
In 2006

657
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Her and her colleagues public

658
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
The human AIDS virus comes from a group of

659
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Champs very specific group

660
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
The live

661
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
A very specific place this little corner

662
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Southeastern camera

663
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Between the

664
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,232
Bumba river river in the Congo River

665
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
These chips recently

666
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Send it

667
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,608
Between these Three Rivers scenario probably only

668
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
100 square miles

669
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Not much more than that

670
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
When we're looking at what humans have

671
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
I'm looking at what all those chimps in Africa

672
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
The most

673
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Perfect match

674
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,688
Is this little territory up there in camera

675
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
There is no other virus that is any

676
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Closer so that's that

677
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,416
So can you reconstruct the spillover and the who did it spilled over into

678
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
It's Betty no asbestos

679
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
You can understand that

680
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
And the best

681
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Hypothesis

682
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Is the cut Hunter

683
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,448
Cut Under the Sea UT Hunter

684
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,264
A hunter who gets cut and what we say about this guy

685
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
I mean Izzy what do we know about if we had to guess

686
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
If we had to guess

687
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
That human was

688
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Probably a Bantu man

689
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Living

690
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,320
Very near the forest or in the forest in Southeastern Cameroon

691
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
He was hunting

692
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Baby had a bow and arrow maybe he got a

693
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Spear

694
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
And

695
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
He kills chimpanzee

696
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
Bingo here's a big pile of me

697
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
And you start the butcher it

698
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
Cutting open the chest cavity pulling out

699
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Oregon

700
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
And

701
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Customs

702
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
And it gets blood to blood contact

703
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
Chimpanzee blood against his blood

704
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
What happens

705
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,856
Is that the virus in the chimpanzee blood

706
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,928
Found itself in an environment that was

707
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Unexpected that was alien to it

708
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
But was not too much different

709
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
From

710
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
The biochemical environment it had been in

711
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Chimpanzee blood

712
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
It could function

713
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
And that's the moment

714
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Begin

715
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
That human

716
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Is

717
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Patient zero

718
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
But why then

719
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Why 1908

720
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
I mean presumably people have been hunting ships for a really long time

721
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Why would this guy be patient

722
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
7 million

723
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
That's another of the big question

724
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,952
People certainly in in central Africa have been eating monkeys

725
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
4

726
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Thousands of years

727
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Larry david scissors

728
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:06,400
Really no way to know but this could have just been the right virus maybe this particular virus

729
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:11,264
Evolved in a way that made it more transmissible in humans or

730
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Maybe you just got lucky

731
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Come along at

732
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Precisely the right

733
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
What you're looking at

734
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Is Carl again

735
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
A time when this part of Africa was

736
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,624
Being heavily colonized the French and the belgians were Building train systems

737
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
Populations were on the move

738
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
Kinshasa which is then leopoldville it was exploding

739
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
It was huge

740
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Cities were attracting people

741
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
From the boonies

742
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
In those days

743
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424
So by 1908 all the virus has

744
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,752
To do is get from that tiny village where the cut Hunter live

745
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Tongzhou new city

746
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
That happens

747
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
Almost certainly

748
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
By river

749
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
I was

750
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,272
Stirred by the work of Beatrice on in micro RV

751
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
To see what this

752
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Scenario look like on the ground

753
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
I went to Southeastern camera on a chartered

754
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,768
A little boat about a 30 foot wooden boat with an outboard motor

755
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Trace the path of the virus

756
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
We went down the in Cocoa River

757
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
And we stopped at a few villages

758
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,472
A couple little village is there one is which has a market

759
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Where you can buy

760
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Monkey meat

761
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Crocodile meat

762
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
And he says it wasn't hard to imagine

763
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Have it all

764
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
Perhaps the cut Hunter gave the virus to a woman

765
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,880
Who then passed it on to a fisherman that I called the Voyager then got in the boat is David

766
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Carried it down the river

767
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
Songo river which is the leading Goku as a tributary of the Tsongas on it becomes a bigger River 200 M wide

768
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Which then flows

769
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
To the Congo River

770
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
The Big River

771
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
And I imagine him

772
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,568
Sliding into brazzaville

773
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
Around 1920 the first HIV positive man to arrive

774
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
5 p.m.

775
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
An urban center

776
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,232
Much greater density of humans were there prostitutes a greater fluidity of Social and sexual

777
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
Interactions and that seems to have been

778
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
The place

779
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
From which

780
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
The disease went global

781
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
So that's how it happened

782
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
We can take it back even farther apus

783
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
For his if you want to make a movie about the

784
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Start up

785
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,096
Because we got it from chimps

786
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Right

787
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
She could ask

788
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Who is Chip seal

789
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
What do we know about chimps

790
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
Right yeah I mean everything comes from somewhere

791
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
And again by molecular work

792
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
Scientists have been able to determine

793
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
That the chimp virus is actually

794
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,040
He actually comes from two monkey virus

795
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
Two different monkeys

796
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
From two completely different species

797
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
What

798
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Would they

799
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
Have encountered each other somewhere

800
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
How to fight

801
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,096
They probably encountered each other in the stomach of a chimp

802
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Well

803
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
From the perspective of a chimpanzee

804
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Monkeys

805
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
They look

806
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Tasty this is Nathan Wolfe

807
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Professor in human biology

808
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,688
Stanford University he says to fully understand

809
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
This part

810
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
The patient

811
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
You're a rather chimp zero narrative

812
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
You have to grasp

813
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
How it is that

814
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
The Chimps hunt

815
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
This is something you witness in the kabali National

816
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,256
Forest Inn in Southwestern Uganda

817
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Describe to us

818
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
Watching three male chimps converge

819
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,008
On a tri-fold colobus monkeys which is very small black and white monkey

820
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,056
And one individual

821
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
Managed to grab two juveniles

822
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,784
And then the three individuals all met up and began to eat the monkey with

823
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,184
Why was still alive the chimpanzee was going after an Oregon you know that that obviously was a a tasty morsel

824
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
I'll bet that he was going after and and the monkey was

825
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Screaming bloody murder

826
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
It is quite

827
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Disturbing to watch

828
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
One of the things that struck me at that moment

829
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Was

830
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
The depth of contact

831
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
Between the blood and body fluids of this monkey and the chimpanzee

832
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,344
The Chimps are literally covered in blood they have blood on their face in their eyes and from the viruses respect

833
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,208
This is spillover heaven

834
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,840
Okay so the following is the closest that we can get to a zero point in this entire narrative we don't know where it

835
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
And we don't know exactly the time say some hundreds of thousands of years ago from the molecular clock we know it was a lesson

836
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
A million years that's all we know but whenever it was

837
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
Chimp zero with hunting

838
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
He comes upon a monkey call the red-capped mangabey the red-capped mangabey this is a larger primate

839
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Laser tree dwellings little tree dwelling

840
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
Little bit of red fur on their heads yes

841
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Gypsy Rose spots one of these monkeys

842
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Eats it

843
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,256
In the process he catches a red-capped mangabey version

844
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
Of the AIDS virus

845
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,192
Next sometime after that first kill

846
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
Weeks months we don't know maybe the same day chimps zero comes across another month

847
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
And this monkey was called a spot nosed guenon yes it's got a spot on its nose I assume there you go.

848
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,112
One of the tiniest monkeys of all the old world monkeys and chips 08 That Monkey

849
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
And gets a spot nosed guenon version of the a

850
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
HIV

851
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
She's got the red-capped mangabey

852
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:00,192
And you've got the the spot nosed guenon to got a kwena Nana manga be two completely different kinds of SIV

853
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,496
Inside the same chip now

854
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:08,384
Under normal circumstances according to Nathan both of these SIV viruses would go nowhere

855
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,736
Because when one of these viruses makes the jump they go from a place they've adapted

856
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,552
They know to completely foreign lands

857
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,904
Like a human being dropped off on Mars maybe without a spacesuit

858
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
Basically you're entering a

859
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Completely alien habit

860
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:28,864
Estelle's don't look the same the environment is different in The Chimps immune system would normally kill them

861
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
But then once in a blue moon something

862
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Crazy happens

863
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
These two viruses

864
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:40,896
This will end up inside the same cell in the same chimp at the same time literally there is a single cell

865
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,712
Simultaneously infected with both viruses

866
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
S'pose on one side of the cell you got the mangabey virus and on the other

867
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Other side of the same cell you got the spot nosed guenon virus

868
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,816
And what happens is

869
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
Literally inside the cell you have an enzyme

870
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:08,800
Call the plumber is on enzyme copying genetic information of the viruses

871
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
This is what viruses do they hijack these enzymes to make copies of themselves

872
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Now

873
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,904
Here's the problem these these enzyme they're not necessarily that sticky and while they're in the process of copying

874
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
One virus every once in awhile will accidentally fall off mid copy and

875
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,376
Go to the second virus

876
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
Just keep on copying and so what it ends up spitting out is a hybrid

877
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,128
Like that

878
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
Now this new Mosaic probably won't go anywhere because 99.999999 9

879
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
10% of the time

880
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Wendy's hybrids happened to dead end

881
00:39:53,856 --> 00:40:00,000
The Chimps immune system is pretty sophisticated in his evolved defenses against these viruses and it will destroy them

882
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
But again once

883
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
In a blue moon

884
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,656
So this is a blue moon after Blue Moon after Blue Moon to really get that

885
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Finally you get

886
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
One particular mosaic virus

887
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,432
Clean the manga be in the guilin that through sheer random luck

888
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
It landed on the exact right combination of genes that

889
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
Allow detuve The Chimps immune system one of the amazing things to think about is how many

890
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,120
How many hopeful monsters you had to have in order to get that one that actually survived

891
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
Probably trillions

892
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
Then boom

893
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,264
Suddenly in a Flash

894
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
From these two virus

895
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,360
I can barely survive in the chimp

896
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
You get a new virus

897
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,224
Little bit mangabey little bit wine in can only survive in the chimp

898
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
Facts for this baby virus

899
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
The chimp is the perfect

900
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
And that was the virus that ended up

901
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Spreading

902
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
Jumping over into humans

903
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
And it's been this

904
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,328
Massive incredibly traumatic

905
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
Sort of tear in the fabric of humanity

906
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
Let me add another event

907
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
They're essentially 12 major groups

908
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,064
Of the HIV virus

909
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
What David means is it

910
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,416
12 different kinds of HIV virus

911
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
Have spilled over 12 different

912
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,280
Times 8 of them came from monkeys

913
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
Three of them came from chimps

914
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
And one came from Gorillaz

915
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
And of those 12

916
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Only one of them

917
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
Is responsible for the global pandemic

918
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
12 times 12 times that we know about

919
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
Probably happened dozens and dozens more time

920
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
That we don't know about

921
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
So

922
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,087
Spillover is not a highly improbable event these sorts of viruses are constantly paying it us

923
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
They're paying us and pinging it us

924
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
We see it happening all the time

925
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
You see it happening

926
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
All time

927
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
Nathan is set up a series of monitoring

928
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,887
In places like central Africa and he and his colleagues been tracking what he calls the viral chatter

929
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,543
In the people who hunt these primates we collected specimens from the animals that they were hunting they compared that the boy

930
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
Blood samples from Hunters themselves and guess what we found a whole range of new retroviruses that were moving over into these

931
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,783
For example he's been tracking something called the Simian foamy virus

932
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,391
Which is in the same family as HIV and he's seen it hot from an individual gorilla

933
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
To an individual human who killed that guy

934
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:43,583
Yeah these are almost certainly what we call primary transmission events houses you really are looking at the

935
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Potential beginning of something

936
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:49,215
Yes you want to Patient Zero really clear patient zero

937
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
Buy it some of these individuals have been infected with these viruses

938
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
And the real question is

939
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
How do we stop patient zero

940
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
How to avoid patient

941
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
Patient one patient exactly

942
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
So Nathan is developing a series of

943
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Tools

944
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
Like digital surveillance

945
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
Some of these places

946
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,023
I work in some places in Democratic Republic of Congo

947
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,351
You basically have to fly in to get there no roads

948
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
Electricity

949
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
But these places are still have cell phones

950
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,055
So Nathan has begun to track cell phone call patterns in these communities

951
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
So he sees a blip

952
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Many calls

953
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,223
The medical center within a short. Of time okay boom now we got to investigate that

954
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
We

955
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
Continue to find viruses that are completely novel

956
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,391
And we're looking to

957
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
Determine if these are

958
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
If these are the next HIV

959
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
Is anybody says

960
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
HIV

961
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,863
Landed in humans at 1908 but we didn't know about it

962
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Until 1981 we had decades

963
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
Time on this was a virus

964
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
4 thread global

965
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
What if we been looking for it

966
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Lot of people to thank for this Eggman

967
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Thanks to Nathan Wolfe

968
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:16,511
For being Nathan and he has an awesome new book called The Viral storm book on viruses

969
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:21,119
This is called a planet of viruses and thank you also to him and to Michael Barbie

970
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,775
Are there interview was recorded on a podcast from Meet the scientist what you can find at microworld

971
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
Text David quammen who's got a book called spillover coming out very soon which is all about diseases crossing over from animals

972
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,063
And also to Beatrice hangzhou University of Pennsylvania

973
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Letting us use

974
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,743
Hey this is Storm wheeler a senior editor and producer Radiolab with a quick update

975
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
David Clements books

976
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Spillovers

977
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Been out for a couple years now and

978
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,447
We all know we are actually now at this moment facing

979
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
Tragic consequences

980
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Another spelling

981
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,127
This time it's the Ebola virus and we found ourselves wondering just

982
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
How far

983
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Going to spill

984
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Alright okay

985
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:13,087
So Robert and I called up David climate again he had actually just reprinted with updates

986
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
The chapter about a bullet from

987
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
Yeah Ebola

988
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,487
The natural and human history of a deadly virus

989
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
How old is this disease anyone have any idea

990
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,191
Well is a human disease as far as we know it dates the 1976

991
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,263
There was this outbreak of a strange disease

992
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
At the youngbou Commission in Northern Zaire

993
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
318 cases

994
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
180 people died

995
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
And then there was another one

996
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:45,599
In Sudan at about the same time this time a hundred and fifty-one people die and then it just

997
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Appears

998
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Hiding in the forest Without a Trace

999
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Until

1000
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,303
1994 thousands of miles away in Gabon another outbreak

1001
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,143
Yes that's what that's the history since 1976 it disappears for

1002
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,007
For two or three years at a time sometimes it disappears for a decade and then it spills over

1003
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:08,895
Because it's a human outbreak if something is in the closet and is going to jump out of

1004
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Use end of natural question to ask

1005
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Where's the class

1006
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Where is it high tide

1007
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
Well then the main suspects

1008
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
Are bats

1009
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
We don't know that for sure

1010
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,231
Because nobody has ever isolated live Ebola virus

1011
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
From an African bat have they tried how they looked and lots and lots of bad and all kinds of animals they looked at

1012
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
Can insects sanlitun snakes it looked in forest

1013
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
Antelopes they looked in monkeys they looked in Plants literally hundreds of different species they looked in found zero traces of

1014
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,967
Live Ebola virus so we really don't know where it's coming from or where it might come from next

1015
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
No

1016
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Can I just

1017
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Ask you just added

1018
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
Describe the Ebola virus

1019
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,999
It's apparently at Thursdays are generally teeny is this a teeny teeny teeny one

1020
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,327
Yes yeah it's a teeny virus that belongs to

1021
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
Family they call the filo viruses

1022
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
Filo is in thread

1023
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
It's a it's a spaghetti shaped

1024
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
Virus genome is carried on

1025
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Just one strand of the

1026
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
The genetic material

1027
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
RNA

1028
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
And while those jeans have lead

1029
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
The virus live happily for hundreds of thousands even millions of years and bats or whatever animal lives in

1030
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
When it gets into humans

1031
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Ebola Burns too hot

1032
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,487
It makes so many copies of itself so quickly that it

1033
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,583
Destroys the body in a person is usually dead within a few weeks

1034
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
David says is

1035
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
Actually bad for the fire

1036
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:40,799
Because Ebola can only pass through direct contact with bodily fluids and because it kills so quickly

1037
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,359
It doesn't have a lot of opportunities to get

1038
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,431
Into the next person so the scientist have a term for that too

1039
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,527
They call at least they used to call us a dead end host how's that for afraid

1040
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Where the dead end host

1041
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Puppy Bowl

1042
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,903
And that means that when Ebola gets into us

1043
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,999
It has no great future it's either going to burn out and come to an end

1044
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Are we going to stop it

1045
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:07,423
But right now we don't seem like a dead end host yeah I'm wondering like you know if we've

1046
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,495
We started noticing a 1976

1047
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,055
A burst here a burst there

1048
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Why

1049
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
Why now this why is it stupid question for Ebola 2014 this time we've got a very different

1050
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Situation has gotten out of control

1051
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Why is it going out of control well

1052
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Partly because

1053
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,207
We recognized it late

1054
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,351
It began back in December 2013 with a two year old boy in Southeastern Guinea

1055
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,935
At least he's the first known case at this point he died

1056
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,335
His mother died about a week later his sister died his grandmother died other people in the village died this went on

1057
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,455
From early December until the middle of March by then it spread from these small

1058
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
Villages into larger cities in part David says because

1059
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,903
Well previous outbreaks have been in very remote places it now found itself in a more

1060
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Densely

1061
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
Populated area to Capital Cities

1062
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
In the small West African countries

1063
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,631
I'm not very many miles away from The Villages of the countryside

1064
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,471
The virus got into these poor neighborhoods like West Point

1065
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,775
How were people were living together in

1066
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
In crowded

1067
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Slum like

1068
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Neighborhood

1069
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
And

1070
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,663
And when their loved ones got sick

1071
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,247
That people took care of them and their loved ones died

1072
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
People

1073
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,855
Clean the bodies and touch the bodies and said goodbye to him

1074
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
So the infection spread

1075
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
And of course those

1076
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,487
Dent poor neighborhoods in the capital cities

1077
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,791
Are not that far from the International Airport

1078
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
The suddenly you've got

1079
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
The opportunity for the almost the first time

1080
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
For Ebola

1081
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
To get on an airplane so if if is

1082
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:52,383
People change the way they think about ebola because it is there a mood shift

1083
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,015
There's a little bit of a mood shift but the experts of scientist Public Health officials are still saying

1084
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,575
This is not that kind of virus

1085
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,367
It still is

1086
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,439
As far as we know a virus that is only

1087
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,791
Transmissible by direct contact with bodily fluids it should be

1088
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
Easy to stop easy to contain

1089
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:18,239
But according to David the thing that some scientists are worried about is that as Ebola gets into more and more people and makes more more coffee

1090
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
Change it yes every time it replicates there's a chance

1091
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
Of a mistake

1092
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,479
The chance of the genes for the next virus will come out just a little bit different it'll

1093
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,807
You take most mutations are either insignificant

1094
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
Or they do damage

1095
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
But occasionally

1096
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,927
There can be a mutation

1097
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,487
That might possibly help the virus

1098
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
Can we track these things like can we

1099
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,375
Can we take a person who's got sick of Ebola in Sudan

1100
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
I compared to person sick of Ebola in the Congo competitive person sick of Ebola in Niger and wherever

1101
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,359
Can we do that and see whether it's changing yes

1102
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,639
And it has been done

1103
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
Steven Geier

1104
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
And his

1105
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,343
Colleagues published a paper in science in early September which involve doing exactly that and one of the things they say

1106
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,183
Francis David is that since this virus has been in US during this outbreak

1107
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
It's been changing twice as fast

1108
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,815
As it has previously when it's living in his animal hiding place

1109
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
Yeah so it has had more opportunities

1110
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
To replicate in more different people that hasn't just been in 300 people it's been in 9,000 people now.

1111
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,615
What is the more opportunities you have to have a

1112
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,919
Good mutation from your point of view

1113
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:36,575
Is it that this is suddenly this disease has gotten an enormous number of opportunities and that is the answer

1114
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Operative word yeah

1115
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,439
Are there boundaries around that I mean like do we have any sense of

1116
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,303
How big leap it would be for this to suddenly be transmissible in the air

1117
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Yeah

1118
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
We know that for this

1119
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Spread through the air

1120
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,703
They're very special machinery

1121
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
You know

1122
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Grappling hook

1123
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,055
Proteins on the outside of

1124
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,151
A virus that help it catch hold of particular cells and enter them

1125
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199
An ebola doesn't have the right

1126
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
Grappling hooks to lay hold of

1127
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
Cells in the respiratory tract and get in them and then come

1128
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,647
Bursting out of them and be carried out word on your breath

1129
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,439
To get to that point

1130
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
Would require

1131
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,815
A number of mutations Each of which has infinitesimally

1132
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:24,191
Unlikely and when you is that apply mutation that it would be startling like a what to a what

1133
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
Been saying that

1134
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,799
It would be like mutations

1135
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
That

1136
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,847
Allowed a giraffe

1137
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Fly

1138
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
But they're rather scenarios that are a little more probable

1139
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,039
For instance it might mutate and adapt in such a way

1140
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
That it kills fewer people

1141
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,647
Or kills them more slowly

1142
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,975
And leave people infectious for a longer period of time

1143
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,279
Maybe people are walking around

1144
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,071
4

1145
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,935
Three or four weeks with an occasional vomiting episodes but there not dying

1146
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
That would

1147
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
Potentially give Ebola

1148
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Greater opportunity

1149
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
To spread among more people

1150
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
What

1151
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,455
This is not a fair question to ask you but what should we be

1152
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Doing

1153
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,599
I think the most important thing we should be doing is not letting

1154
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:18,719
The public health vs. civil civil liberties issues in the US distract us

1155
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
From West Africa

1156
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,863
Is the case count gets we talked about this is the case count gets higher it has more opportunities

1157
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
To mutate

1158
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,215
And therefore more opportunities to adapt

1159
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,263
So we need to end this outbreak

1160
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
In West Africa

1161
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
Before this virus learns too much about us

1162
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:58,399
Thanks again to David quammen his book is Ebola

1163
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
The natural and human history of a deadly virus

1164
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
I'll be back

1165
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
And just mama

1166
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
My name is Brandon Novak and I'm calling for

1167
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
Reykjavik Iceland

1168
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
We're about half

1169
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,943
What country believes in elves

1170
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,807
Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation

1171
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
And by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

1172

1174
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,767
More information about Sloan at

1175
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
Www. Sloan

1177
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,287
Aaron Neville at one of my proudest moments of being a dad

1178
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
Yeah having this morning

1179
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
A little bit in

1180
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
Wedding socializes enough well

1181
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
We were taking him to daycare

1182
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,087
And where it gets he's taking his shoes off in this little boy whose

1183
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
Only there two days a week and he's not a

1184
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
Testing well

1185
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,951
Every time his mother drops

1186
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,767
It's a little late cry him offer

1187
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Swelling

1188
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,095
So meal sit down on this

1189
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
I'll see to take a

1190
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
She's off

1191
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Mother of this kid puts

1192
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
Little boy next to a meal

1193
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
He is

1194
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
Crying

1195
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Trot

1196
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
Tibet

1197
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
What happened to

1198
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Emil turns this little boy

1199
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Looks at him

1200
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Sticks out his hand

1201
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Incest

1202
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,815
Yeah cuz it's like they're at their out in their own societies you know

1203
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:37,215
Yeah okay so let's do the introductions I'm Jared I'm Robert this is Radiolab on the show patient

1204
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
Zero patience

1205
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
Exactly

1206
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,847
Let's focus instead on invention

1207
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
On the people

1208
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Who bring new ideas into the wall

1209
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
Yeah the zeros behind the ideas

1210
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,767
Contributing writer at the New York Times magazine

1211
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,583
Her first high-five is actually about

1212
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
V

1213
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
First high five

1214
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
Ever

1215
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
Ever

1216
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,007
One morning a few years ago 2007

1217
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,359
Four 2008 John turn down his computer open up his email and found or press release

1218
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,687
Movies about the true Undisputed inventor of the high five

1219
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,991
Coming you know outline Lisa press release from

1220
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,831
National High Five Day which is a kind of a joke holiday

1221
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:30,719
That was invented by a group of high school friends I think and they told the story they told the story of Le Mans

1222
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:37,119
College basketball player Murray State in Kentucky

1223
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:43,519
Is released when something like that deletes his father fought in Vietnam that's part of the 1st Battalion 5th Infantry

1224
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,055
Is nicknamed the five

1225
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,895
And they've used to greet each other by holding up their hand and saying five

1226
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
As a kind of prideful

1227
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:57,343
And when Lamont was younger they would also to hang out at the house in Kentucky and you can keep all their names straight so when they walk in

1228
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,647
In the door and go 5 he would just hurt not going to hand

1229
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
Lego hi-five I like high like hello five hello five, you know he has small hands he likes to put the

1230
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:13,471
I'm up against the big hands of the Five Guys and it was years later that he started playing college basketball at Murray State

1231
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,871
Started high-fiving all seem really never stopped high-fiving was just something he did when he went around playing away games other team

1232
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
He's picked it up and it's already spread out so

1233
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,759
He was sort of both the inventor of the high five in the kind of Johnny Apple

1234
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
High five at the same time

1235
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,879
And within a few weeks of John getting his press release the story was

1236
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Everywhere

1237
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,767
Antiviral he wound up sort of all over the Internet there was some local newspapers who you know picked it up

1238
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
You know Marie states only became very proud of the fact that they were there

1239
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,935
The home of the high five if you can sort of party institutional lower in the athletic department

1240
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,983
Can you read this

1241
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
I thought

1242
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,567
How's that

1243
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Sad

1244
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,711
Because I knew the story of Glenn Burke

1245
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Turns out John had already been poking around and

1246
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
This question who invented the

1247
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,647
I-5 and he'd stumbled on this photograph

1248
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
But black and white picture

1249
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,303
Two baseball players facing each other afros

1250
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Cute smiles

1251
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,911
And their hands are in the air right about to connect

1252
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
Which one of these is Glen Burton

1253
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,495
Burke's the guy in the warm-up jacket

1254
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,287
I think he's even got his hat on backwards

1255
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,359
Glenn Burke was a center fielder for the LA Dodgers

1256
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
The 70s

1257
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,175
Big guy he says he had 17 in

1258
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
I'll take his word for the

1259
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
You're the guy in the picture is Dusty Baker he's an outfielder

1260
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,575
You can tell

1261
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
In the picture

1262
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,159
Just been the way the glenister throwing his whole body forward the

1263
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
He's the one initiating the gesture

1264
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
I mean this is the guy who was

1265
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
You know the soul of the Dodgers

1266
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,583
He just had that type of I'm charisma

1267
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,887
This is Luther Burke Davis Glen sister

1268
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,167
Woodglen it was like

1269
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,055
But he's always be on the stage often said he should have been a comedian

1270
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
In the club as he used

1271
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
To do Richard Pryor

1272
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,895
Stand-up routines

1273
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,711
Search for memories you just genuinely love people

1274
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,783
So much so she says that in the year that picture was taken

1275
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,159
The Dodgers made him that they should have public face of the team he was there an ambassador of Goodwill

1276
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,999
He's the guy they said that to all the Press event you like meet the youngsters on cats

1277
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
Here's the story about this picture

1278
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,071
What was the date

1279
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,351
October 5th

1280
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,959
Politically enough 1977

1281
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
Phillies game four bases are loaded Dusty Baker steps to the plate and

1282
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Grand Slam Crowd Goes Nuts

1283
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:40,159
Are you coming to the play really high up in Baker

1284
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,975
Before you know it Bergen Baker

1285
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Smacking

1286
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Bam there was

1287
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:52,447
The sportscasters that would you know announcing the game said they had never seen that done in sports before

1288
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,543
And from there on the Dodgers started high-fiving and everyone else started by 5

1289
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,319
It all began with that one moment the platonic Hi-Fi right there

1290
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,111
Unfortunately

1291
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:14,975
That moment that was actually supposed to be getting in and also almost the end of

1292
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
Berks career wasn't good

1293
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,583
He's actually really good even in his rookie season

1294
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,911
He was being talked about as the next Willie Mays by the Dodgers organization

1295
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
But

1296
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,471
He was gay

1297
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
And he

1298
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
Try to keep that a secret while he was playing

1299
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,735
A Dusty Baker actually had kept trying to set him up with his wife's cousins and the birth never want you to never liked any of them and they

1300
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
These are really good looking women apparently

1301
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,415
So there are rumors circulating the rumors reached the front office of of the

1302
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:48,255
The LA Dodgers and and one day Burke was called in by management

1303
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,839
And they offered him $75,000

1304
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,863
To get married

1305
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,679
Why is 75000 to get married

1306
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,287
Just like a mop or something like that they didn't regularly offer their players

1307
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,127
Money to get to get married in and Burkes response apparently was

1308
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,687
He said I suppose you mean to a woman

1309
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
Shortly after that

1310
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
The Dodgers traded into the Oakland A's

1311
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,367
Pro player who everyone acknowledge was completely inferior

1312
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,999
That was confusing for us and I know it had to be confusing for him it was shocking everyone no one understood why

1313
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
He was traded

1314
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Was cuz he was gay

1315
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Yeah

1316
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,143
Yashow baseball this all American sport

1317
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
But

1318
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
You know Lizzy was still going to be able to play ball

1319
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,823
Jodeci.

1320
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,871
Doesn't get very much playing time

1321
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
And when he did get on the field

1322
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,759
It wasn't very pleasant just get heckled a lot you know some people in the bleachers and

1323
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
An even worse according to a couple of different people his coach

1324
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Billy Martin

1325
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
What often introduce Glenbrook this way

1326
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
This is Glenbrook the faggot

1327
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Really

1328
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,535
Yeah and so Glenbrook retires

1329
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,839
Don't like 26 or

1330
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,655
Yes he was young within a year of his rookie

1331
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Just walks

1332
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
God that's like

1333
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
Aborted carrier

1334
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,823
Exactly from their hands up in the Castro District

1335
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
In San Francisco

1336
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,639
Is the big gay neighborhood and things go

1337
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
Okay for a while then one day when he's crossing the street three teenage girls and their mothers car come barreling down the road

1338
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
And they hitting

1339
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,391
And broke his leg in three places

1340
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,719
And that kind of ended everything that happened

1341
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,535
He starts taking painkillers

1342
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
One thing leads

1343
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Another

1344
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,167
He gets hooked on crack can't hold a job because broke

1345
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
End up living on the streets

1346
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,775
And in 1994

1347
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,823
Burke is diagnosed with

1348
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,175
With HIV or Aids I can say to that point

1349
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,015
Last time she didn't sleep well at night

1350
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
And we will sit up and talk

1351
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
Put on music in

1352
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,719
I danced and he move his arms around cuz he was in the bed

1353
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
He was bedridden

1354
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,863
So you took care of him till he died

1355
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
Yeah

1356
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,215
Glenbrook died in 1995

1357
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
But what he's left with

1358
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,823
At this point is he's left with

1359
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
The original high five

1360
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
That's his claim yes

1361
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
That defined

1362
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
To some people that lie

1363
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Is that the end

1364
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,503
And he and he believed

1365
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
A reporter in Houston

1366
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:24,927
You know if it was true about the high five in and he said yeah I think about the feeling you get when you give someone a high five

1367
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
I had that feeling before everybody else did

1368
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
So what did you do when you got this

1369
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
So I called National High Five Day

1370
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,471
Because I wanted to talk to Lamont

1371
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Even though I was sad

1372
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,079
It seems like okay here's another person's

1373
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Prideful

1374
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Accomplishment

1375
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,663
Let's get his story

1376
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Hello eventually

1377
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
You get this kind of phone

1378
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
My name is Greg Harrell Edge

1379
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:54,111
Greg is one of the founders and he and John got to talking and John asks him

1380
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,183
Sensible first question the Lamont sleep story

1381
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
True he figured was Buddy night

1382
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Don't you at least ask

1383
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Reporter

1384
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,583
And there was a pause and he said

1385
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
No frankly

1386
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,983
We've been waiting for someone to ask we thought no one would ever ask it's not true it's just something

1387
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,383
We can meet up we wanted to see if the media would would run with it and made the whole thing and then they just went to go cast

1388
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
There we set that we picked

1389
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
Murray State

1390
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:26,111
That's just kind of a great Sunday school at pops up in the NCAA tournament every few years and they came across this guy Lamont's

1391
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
YMCA well

1392
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
It was pretty close to rant

1393
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:33,791
They then told me they had received an email from Le Mans litzas wipes

1394
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:38,399
His wife emailed us and said some of the details that you have or are flat-out wrong

1395
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
Some of the things you said are right though

1396
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,775
But Lamont thinks he probably did invent the high five

1397
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,359
What about Glenn I was kind of like

1398
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,199
Kana a bit Blown Away

1399
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
You know

1400
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,759
You know here was this guy who is

1401
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
Proud of this and these guys

1402
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
Just kind of drifted away from

1403
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
Do you feel a little guilty

1404
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,951
Did I mean like okay to high-five it's kind of a

1405
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
The silly thing on the other hand

1406
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Is life the way he died

1407
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
I'm lucky Rob. We do feel we do feel

1408
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,167
We wish that we had done things slightly different

1409
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,959
In putting together this sort of

1410
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
Collegiate prank

1411
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,567
But we didn't really know Glenn Burke at that time

1412
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,871
Greg said they hadn't heard of the Glenbrook

1413
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
Story when they pulled this

1414
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Now that they know it

1415
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
They really feel bad

1416
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,551
Sector now organizing a charity event they're calling the national High 5 ortho

1417
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,623
Which will raise money for charity including one chosen by

1418
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
Glenbrooks

1419
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:36,767
Sister Luther very proud anytime I see somebody do a high-five he just really makes me happy

1420
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
And that seemed like a good end of the story

1421
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,839
But

1422
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:45,471
No because then John told us that if you really honestly want to get to the bottom of who invented the high five

1423
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,311
We we didn't think we want to but now there were in it what the hell where you got to go

1424
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,847
Beyond Glenbrook

1425
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,527
I've wanted you to believe

1426
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,855
Glenbrook died believing that the high five was his legacy

1427
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,719
Add more or less the same moment that he invented it a guy named Eric Smith

1428
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,023
A basketball player for the Louisville Cardinals

1429
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
Was that practice

1430
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,375
And a guy named Wiley Brown went up to Derek Smith

1431
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,935
And was going to give him just a ordinary low five

1432
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
Derek Smith looking in the eye

1433
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,847
This is what Wiley Brown told me to look him in the eye and said no up high

1434
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:32,063
That yours Lewisville team they were they were known as the doctors of dunk neither high-flying team they played Above the Rim

1435
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,647
Who played in the 1980 NCAA finals

1436
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,719
I haven't seen it but apparently the broadcaster refer tax

1437
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
The high five handshake

1438
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,071
Handshake

1439
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:49,727
He felt compelled to explain it to America and it did at the moment the Derek Smith did it did an asteroid fall on his head

1440
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Well

1441
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,871
In 1996 I believe in in the 90s he had an undiagnosed heart condition

1442
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,943
And he just died all the sudden donut on a cruise ship

1443
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
What does

1444
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
And

1445
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:06,111
He said explicitly the Wiley Brown this is something I'm going to be remembered for

1446
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:11,743
You know our kids and our grandkids are going to talk about this and in fact their kids and grandkids do talk about and they're probably very proud

1447
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:18,911
But we ran into this one

1448
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,471
Volleyball in the 1960s years

1449
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Before Glenn Burke and Eric Smith

1450
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,055
She said with her girls everyone did it

1451
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,639
All the time so I do believe that it was volleyball that first started

1452
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:35,039
She says they would high five more on a player screwed up about celebration

1453
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:40,159
Do you need a high five course it's more when you're down so happy

1454
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,183
So women's volleyball

1455
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
There you go

1456
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
No slip out Infinity

1457
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:50,143
Because then our producer of The Levy also discovered that in the movie Breathless

1458
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,031
19:55 in exactly 1 hour 18 minutes into the film you will see to Frenchman

1459
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,823
Do a very distinct

1460
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,895
Who sang right there

1461
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,087
Is anusol like an indication to you

1462
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
It's maybe

1463
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
It's one of those things it

1464
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,951
Probably is there the dawn of man

1465
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,863
Because it might give us pleasure from evolutionary

1466
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,727
I think this has the feeling of something that was born and who in this room wants Lindbergh to be the original

1467
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,287
Trader and Mia Mimi

1468
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,359
It's a better story every time

1469
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
We look for the original at anything

1470
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
Disease

1471
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Engagement

1472
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Chester

1473
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
We find more than one

1474
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
So what are you doing

1475
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,623
I think you know what you do is you just choose you say which one is the better story

1476
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:47,487
What does go with the best type I forget the first the best and I think we could do that

1477
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
Glen

1478
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
Glenn Burke

1479
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,583
Invented the high five

1480
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
