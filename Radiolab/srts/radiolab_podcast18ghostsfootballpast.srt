00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
What's up everybody this is Jad Radiolab

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
Spry podcast here tomorrow is the

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
The game

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Go Eagles

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
And

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
Whether you like football or not

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
Whether you like it or not

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
One of the biggest

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Sporting events

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
In the world

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
And it's a game that in many ways his

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Is always been wrapped up

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
In what America is

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
This is what it isn't

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
It's a

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
What we thought we do just as a corrective measure is

20
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Is Bring Back

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
Do we put together a couple years ago

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
About the origin

23
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
It's kind of Amazing Stories

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
It looks like we're all going to be sitting there watching

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Tom Brady

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Probably

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,160
Hopefully not win another Superbowl and we'll be watching Timberlands

28
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,184
Do the halftime thing

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
It's right at all no one will be talking about the people

30
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Without whom the game would be nothing

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
So this is an honor of them

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
Just the way that we got to from

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Journalist and author Sally Jenkins

34
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
From her book the real Olive

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
I mean football

36
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,640
Football is as old as some of the Celtic civilization semeniuk

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Can trace

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,992
Primal games of you know Danish Invaders

39
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,624
Kicking skulls around the shores of England I mean

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Put up organized football is really a creation of

41
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,536
Of the 1860s and 70s in this country it's a post Civil War

42
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
Creation comes along

43
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
Just really a couple of years after he had the last

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
Great conquering armies

45
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Settle the West

46
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,872
Basically says you had these kids whose parents fought in the Civil War and then some of them is gone west

47
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,760
To fight the Lakota the Cheyenne Arapaho the Apaches and now those washer winding down

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,600
Which oddly enough created kind of an issue for young men at the

49
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,976
If your young students a back east at a fancy school like Harvard how are you going to prove

50
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Your own

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Your older brother

52
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
Your father he may be fought at Gettysburg Battle Little Bighorn

53
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
What the hell have you done

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
The American frontier experience was over

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,288
There was a feeling among a lot of intellectuals that

56
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
.com

57
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,152
American men were losing their masculinity they were being

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Feminized innocence Sao

59
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Korean story of David Adams

60
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
You just heard

61
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Those kids were desperate for opportunities

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
To man up there was a cult of Manliness around this time says David

63
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
Fancy a bunch of violent Sports takeoff and in particular

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Frye purses

65
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
You see these kids at Harvard Yale

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Getting together in

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Knocking the snot out of each other in this game that's kind of like rugby but just

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
More finely

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
The game used to be

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Basically

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Brutality

72
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
The origin football was such a

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
Game writer Chuck Klosterman 4him historian. Conrad

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
3 towns to get five yards and basically all the teams did

75
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
Was Liam into each other and try to move the ball incrementally it was almost as if every play

76
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Play the entire game

77
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,152
With a goal-line stand in the Middle Ages use when discussing football scores

78
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
Is military it's the idea of taking land and giving them

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Will the origin of football that was even Ampla

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
There were formations and strategies and that kind of thing but it was

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Cure

82
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Like right out of Napoleon's

83
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
Military Playbook me where you you concentrate your Force

84
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
Sia showed my shoulder neck to your shoulder neck to his shoulder I think it's a lie

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
All your man in them Pierce The Other Guys Army that was the basic idea

86
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Piles of guys

87
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Yeah and inside those files

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
There's all kinds of things go on in those scrubs I mean just kicking his fighting is gouging High couching in track

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
Kicking and

90
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
Wowhead wrenching and

91
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
I have to work

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
To imagine that big

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Because I think of Harvard meal now and I think

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,440
Take off like a Pencil Neck Geek

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
Well at the time they were the I mean they're all these wonderful stories about these

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
Chops that they would eat for dinner I mean they were

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
Drinking milk by the gallon and a great

98
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
Power of the time physically as well as intellectually

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Then Along Comes A School

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
My little school

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
In 1879 in the middle of nowhere

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
That

103
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
If you're a football fan

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
The fan of American history

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Kind of changed

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
Where was Carlo Carlo was in Pennsylvania

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,487
Very close to Gettysburg so so so tell me about what what is the

108
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,607
This wind is it formed and what was it they are the Carlisle Indian School is formed by a former of

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
But actually he was an active military off

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,495
At the time named Richard Henry Pratt bagai shock of white hair

111
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Large nose

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
Gallantly quite gallantly in the Civil War

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
And then he had actually served out west in Oklahoma territory

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
He had fought American Indians himself

115
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
It was after winning a lot of those fights

116
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Too many of those fights really

117
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
We're talking about 1870s now that Pratt

118
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
How to change your heart and he

119
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
He suddenly became concerned

120
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
About the very people you just been fighting the fact of the matter is that

121
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
Indians weren't very very desperate situation

122
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
Are the Bison we're almost there

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
Extinct that they were being pushed onto reservations

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
And population

125
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Fallen 2

126
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
All Time Low

127
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Pratt and a lot of other

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to happen

129
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Fast or Indians would literally become extinct they would in fact become

130
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
The Vanishing race

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Ancel Pratt

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
He comes to Washington with an idea

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
His idea was started boarding school specifically for American Indian children

134
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
It was kind of a radical experiment children will be taken removed

135
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
For several years at a time

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
They would be

137
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
Stripped of their

138
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,479
I was called her Savage Heritage and they would be civilized

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
IE they would be white attire

140
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
It was it was forcible assimilation

141
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Pratt head of a slogan

142
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Kill the Indian

143
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Save the man

144
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
That's Barbara Landis

145
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Probiotic

146
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
Will one of the Carlyle to talk with her and her colleague Kara Curtis

147
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
And they told us it Pratt basically made that pitch

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Save the man

149
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,823
Not just to Congress by directly to American Indian families all over the country I want your son

150
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
Is that my house isn't worth your children because

151
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,271
White people are going to keep coming and coming they want to settle in your lands they want to take your land

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
And you need to learn how to

153
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Deal with these people

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
So we need to teach your children how to speak English to communicate with the white vans

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
When the white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the Black Hills

156
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
You won't fall for it again

157
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
And it was a convincing argument

158
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Well do you know back in those days

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
You're talking about survival over here

160
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Do you mind introducing yourself

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Hey my name is Joe American Horse

162
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,687
79 years old and the grandson of Chief American Horse

163
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,527
Joe lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota East Lakota

164
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
He told us the story about his grandfather

165
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
I was a famous Lakota chief

166
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
In the 1890s is Grandpa's lead a delegation of American Indians to

167
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Washington

168
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
Well he went to Washington DC

169
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,215
And if he was down there but he's a lot of people down there just as his grandpa had this moment where he was just

170
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Standby how many white people

171
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
His face was there like ants

172
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,127
Come to the area so

173
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
He had the idea of a

174
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
Trying to send his kids to school so they can

175
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
Intermingle or whatever

176
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
Basically Joe says his grandpa just had this realization

177
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Recant

178
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
We can't go back

179
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Got to go forward

180
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
And it seemed to him Carlisle

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Was the way for

182
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,191
Who are we going now

183
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,519
Baskets were admitted here's how it would work they would come in

184
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
And it immediately have their picture taken

185
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
On arrival

186
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
Then they be given an Extreme Makeover

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Which would also be photographed

188
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
This is Tom torlino

189
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,791
Barber showed us a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old today 1882

190
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
This is one of your ride so you he's got kind of dark-skinned high cheekbones hearing

191
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,823
He's wearing elaborate necklace looks like it might be made of bone and he's wrapped in a blanket

192
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
And then I hear he is in a suit with clean cut hair the second picture his hair is very short not long

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
No blanket

194
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
It's wearing a three-piece suit sitting there with spread collar and parted hair

195
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Snapchat you have

196
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Indian

197
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Tom Wightman

198
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Alex and Sophie

199
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Joe American Horse

200
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,703
His family's all that transformation firsthand and Sophie was there in Carlisle for 5 years

201
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,567
When she came back and she looks like a white woman to know she had that real tiny waist and

202
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Vomiting everything

203
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
And

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
You can speak Lakota

205
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
She forgot

206
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Haha

207
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
We just think about the

208
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Disrespect

209
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
We spoke with one guy oppressor Eric Anderson who teaches at Haskell is us apart Potawatomi just a mess

210
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Imagine the parents

211
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
First time they see their kid

212
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
Kids parents are seeing their students marched around in

213
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Essentially the uniform

214
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Of

215
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
What had not

216
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
Very long before for many of the tribes

217
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Ben

218
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
The uniform of the enemy

219
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
At the very least

220
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
I think that would be

221
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Startling

222
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Did a case

223
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
According to Sally Jenkins after the kids were

224
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Cropped and redressed

225
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Brentwood running through a bunch of

226
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
Drill sanding Carlisle was a little Military Academy

227
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
And the Indian kids were so unhealthy at first they have been put on an unfamiliar diet they had been sleeping indoors

228
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
For the first time in their lives and a lot of them are getting sick

229
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Movie know that Hindi 39-year history

230
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
The school

231
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
At least

232
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
200 kids died

233
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
A disease

234
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
4Health or even homes

235
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Hand soap

236
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Was constantly trying to get the kids outside

237
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
And

238
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
At a certain point he hired some teachers

239
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
Sally thinks that one of those hires

240
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
Probably one of the first dormitory Masters

241
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
This guy who had formerly taught at at Ivy Leagues

242
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
School he showed the Carlisle Indian kids

243
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
This game that the kids at Harbor playing

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Have you thought it would toughen him up

245
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
No it's but suddenly

246
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
They're playing football

247
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
No keep in mind this is at a point in 1882 where

248
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Football's barely a thing

249
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Not so many schools had teams

250
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
It wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then they were volunteer coaches who tended to be students or ex-students for the Carlisle

251
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,951
Kids self-organized level the field start to play they even start to scrimmage some kids across town

252
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
And it one of those games

253
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Call you Barbara

254
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,887
Staci Matlock who is upon a student at Carlisle later became a Pawnee chief

255
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
He broke his leg

256
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Playing football in Pratt that's it

257
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Football

258
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
Is in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids in football was doing the opposite

259
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
But

260
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Showtime later

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,367
Set David Adams approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came into Pratt's office they said we want to play football

262
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Do you know what they said exactly we don't have

263
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
We don't have the exact words

264
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Buy Pratt says at one point

265
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
He says while they stood around my desk

266
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,447
I'm quoting here around my desk there black eyes intensely watching

267
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,079
This is the order gave practically all the arguments in favor

268
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
About contending

269
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
An outside football

270
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
And ended up

271
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Requesting the removal of the Embargo

272
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
According to his Memoir Pratt was

273
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,903
Bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the peel

274
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
So we said

275
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Okay you can play

276
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
If you do these two things what he says

277
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Never slept

278
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
People who are looking

279
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Okay

280
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America

281
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,383
And that early Point American football

282
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Team was yell

283
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,527
Which brings us to October 24th 1896

284
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,367
It's a r off all day in New York New York

285
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Yes at the old Polo Grounds

286
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Apparently there was about four thousand people in the stands including a handful of newspaper men New York newspaper men

287
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Give me a big story

288
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
How did they publicize it what did they say

289
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
They represent specifically the Perfection of mod

290
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,015
American Life

291
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
On the other side

292
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
The real Sun

293
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
Origin playing the Redskins history and story of War developed

294
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
By education and if you read the newspaper stories are written as they're written in this kind of blood curdling

295
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,383
Shot through with Indian cliches you know from the Redskins

296
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
Right right Cody's David Adams in one paper

297
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Indian fashion

298
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,719
I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker in the early 1880s PR contact with an American Indian

299
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Was in a wild west show

300
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
It was theater

301
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
And here comes a football game

302
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,935
And all of these American Indian kids run onto the field and there's literally an instance

303
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,287
What are the first games with someone in the audience says will they look just like our boys

304
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Because of course

305
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
That's a pratt wanted

306
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
Now one thing it was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlyle players was that they were physically outmatched

307
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Dell Rapids

308
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
Shaklee 20 lb Spider-Man impression going in as it'll be an absolute smear job

309
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
But they released the odds are heavily against them

310
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
But

311
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
3 minutes into the game

312
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
EBay big pile up

313
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Squirting out

314
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Carla guy picks it up

315
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
And runs

316
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
The entire length of the field 63 yards

317
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,671
Scores a touchdown

318
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Now

319
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:59,839
Nobody had scored on Yale and seven games they were Furious so what they do is they use their bulk

320
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
To slowly

321
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Push

322
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
The pile down the field

323
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Twice

324
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
To take leave

325
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
And with three minutes left

326
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
Jealous up 12 to 6 Carlisle has the ball

327
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Carlisle running back charges the pile in gets clobbered falls backwards

328
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
And just as he's about to hit the earth he laterals the ball

329
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
To a teammate who grabs it runs around the scrum the entire length of the field

330
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game

331
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
But

332
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Called back

333
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Bye

334
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
A referee

335
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Who was the Yale man

336
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
Why the call was that the referee claimed that a whistle had blown

337
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
The play dead

338
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
Well they were they were Furious

339
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Yes there was bullying them

340
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
And hooting

341
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,119
Everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of Justice we're going to walk out of

342
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
We are leaving this game

343
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
But according to David

344
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
At the last moment

345
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,591
Runs down from the stand coming onto the fields at Wayside ways I don't forget rule number one

346
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
A gentleman

347
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Pratt did not want

348
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
This game to end

349
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Because of

350
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Their tempers even though they've been wrong

351
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
Bye-bye that call

352
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
So the Cowboys

353
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Finish the game

354
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
And when they walk off the field

355
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
They get a standing ovation

356
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
Carlisle wins incredible respect and renown

357
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
In the aftermath of the game in fact one of the newspaper men

358
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
After another Carlisle Yale game or something similar

359
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
Wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11 yell men but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a Yale rep

360
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Yes

361
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
After the Yale game of 1896

362
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Pratt

363
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Is committed

364
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,399
Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school

365
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15

366
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Years at the Carlisle school which is to

367
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Prove the value

368
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
Are these American Indian kids against their white peers

369
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
D'Abruzzo value or civilized

370
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
To civilize them but also to prove that given education and equal opportunity

371
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
They were the equal of there

372
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
How's their white peers

373
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,023
He was before all of his forcible assimilation methods which were

374
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
Remain extremely cruel

375
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
And destructive

376
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
I truly believed

377
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
In the concept of of racial equality

378
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
The complicatedness

379
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
Pratt ahold Carlisle idea

380
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,479
Kep smacking ass in the face as we were putting the show together it mean on the one hand they were clearly students who felt

381
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
The Carlyle was prison

382
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
Is that Barbara Landis

383
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
When she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former

384
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Carlisle Indians

385
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
She said the kids will even set fire to the building

386
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,839
It's a yes M did burn down which is kind of typical on Indian campuses

387
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,423
Fires in burning building why

388
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Int form of resistance

389
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
On the other hand

390
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
When will you start looking around for original archival recordings of

391
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
See the earliest Carlisle players pretty much the only recording me to find

392
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
If you're making it

393
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,927
With this oral history with a guy named

394
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,863
Albert exendine in the early 70s

395
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Justice

396
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
B99

397
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
You are 15 years old

398
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,383
Can't really play you too much of this cuz the audio quality is really bad but in the interview Brad comes up

399
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Stratosphere

400
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,295
And xidan talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude

401
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Father of indian education

402
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415
Call the father of Indian education

403
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
Man so he's a tough figure Pratt he's got very mixed Legacy I mean I like to say Pratt was his country

404
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Whatever you think of him he was his country

405
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Sookie sookie 1896 he gets

406
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
The Berkeley

407
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
UCF football score PR yes

408
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
What happens next

409
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
He begins looking around for coaches full-time coaches

410
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
Just to come in and coached

411
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
The team

412
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
And he whines up

413
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
With Cornell grad

414
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Name Pop Warner

415
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
Glenn Pop Warner

416
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Is this part right here

417
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Just to give you a visual

418
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
Kerasotes pictures

419
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,687
If Mike did go ahead Einstein's hair up Pops a little bit of a of an outlier

420
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
East Texas roads

421
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
He's a bit of a rogue

422
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
Can be kind of vulgar party a little bit

423
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,511
And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion

424
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,375
When you get to the Carlyle because Pop Warner looks at his Squad and he realizes that

425
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
Sure they're fast they got heart but they're underweight and they're small

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,079
Wasteful yeah well they might occasionally for Setai with it where they yell if they

427
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
You know

428
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Have killed themselves

429
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Physically

430
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,991
They weren't going to beat the ivy League's on any kind of consistent basis without

431
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Without doing something different

432
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,879
And dumped it was a very fine line between innovation

433
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
And cheating

434
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
In Pop Warner start 6

435
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,815
Exploding that line absolutely as hard as he can

436
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
And he comes up with

437
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
The trick play

438
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
For example

439
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
1903 Pop Warner devices the hidden ball trick what was that

440
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,383
The hidden ball trick is the quarterback takes the ball

441
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
And actually

442
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
Behind the Chute Parliament

443
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,295
Tucks it under another guy's sweater

444
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
While the big pile of man is struggling in the mud in the center of the field not knowing quite where the football is but believing it's summer

445
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
Summer in the middle of the pile there's this kid who squirts around the end but the football hidden under his jersey and he's 30 yards downfield beef

446
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
Before anybody realizes it how does it keep the ball from falling out of his jersey

447
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
The Jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out a cheating pocket native cheating

448
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,224
Pocket without legal because I got to go together legitimate touchdown

449
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Was it legal you ask

450
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Pop Warner would have said

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,952
There was nothing in the rulebook against it another thing he does which actually worked brilliantly

452
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Is a

453
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Piso's

454
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,072
Footballs on to the front of their

455
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Jerseys

456
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
Switch for really bulky sweaters at the time he sews leather football-shaped patches onto the front of their jerseys

457
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
In order to try to disguise who's got the ball

458
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Sane

459
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,296
Betches Bachelorette

460
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
But

461
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Harvard

462
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
Did not take this line. Harvard retaliates by painting the footballs the same color as their

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,144
Jersey's it's maroon everywhere so when they basically what you can't see

464
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,776
American football is essentially a rule-breaking experience

465
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
As opposed

466
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
British football

467
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Didn't have referees

468
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
At least initially a British football ran on the underside

469
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
But with American football

470
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
The rest were there practice

471
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
In the beginning and she says it was largely a response

472
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
The brutality the game but also to the kind of rule band

473
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
That you saw from Pop Warner in the coral island

474
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,304
Everytime Pop Warner came up with an innovation the next year there was a rule against

475
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,144
So immediately I really would get together and pass a rule and say okay no more

476
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,520
NFL rulebook really virgins in an American football and it's thanks to Pop Warner

477
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Sleight of hand

478
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
In pop Warner's Greatest Latest

479
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
And maybe

480
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
The Carlisle Indians most soaring moment and I mean that literally

481
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Happened

482
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
At a moment when the game almost

483
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Disappeared

484
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Nest cam

485
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
Start of message

486
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
Yes this is David Adam Strange and I got an email message asking me to read credit text

487
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science

488
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,992
Technology in the modern world more information about Sloan

489
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
At www.

490
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Sloan. Org okay there it is

AdvoCare

492
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
And this message

493
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,048
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

494
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
And I'm here because I need your help

495
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
And I request

496
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,032
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

497
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,872
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling

498
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
Tiny moments of brilliance

499
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,272
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

500
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,600
It just means you bring back and say whoa

501
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Maybe it was the moment that I

502
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,488
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

503
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Do you

504
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

505
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,912
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

506
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,776
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

507
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
We're interested in the

508
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Epic moments where

509
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
Kid does something super smart

510
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

511
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
If you have a story

512
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
T-shirt with us

513
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Go to radiolab.org

514
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
Flash brilliance

515
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,392
And record a short audio message

516
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
And that's radiolab.org

517
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Brilliance

518
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Thank you so much

519
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
Amgen abumrad and Robert krulwich

520
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,456
Is Radiolab and getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian School and the

521
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Birth of the

522
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Football

523
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,904
What are the most important moments in the story I happens at a time when football it was right on the edge

524
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Spearing

525
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Timeout 1905

526
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
This was

527
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
The most violent year in football

528
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,728
19 people died on the football 19

529
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
19

530
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
That's crazy

531
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,896
Cuz what would happen is that Carla will try and do these things that are open up the game

532
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,760
The iveys would consistently respond by making the game more about Brute Force more about violence

533
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,088
And suddenly all the major programs

534
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
We're spooked

535
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Columbia polls

536
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
Are there football team

537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,536
Harvard even think about doing that and so and this is kind of odd Into The Fray steps

538
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
President of the United States of America

539
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Teddy Roosevelt

540
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
The conrad beijing

541
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
He's like football he like the

542
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
The manly aspects of it's a tough aspects of it

543
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
But nobody like people dying

544
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
And then there was his

545
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
Skip gets his son

546
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
What's playing

547
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
And and getting beat up pretty badly

548
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
As well

549
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Broke his nose

550
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Plated eyebrow

551
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
The one game you got knocked out cold

552
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
So after the violence of 05

553
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
The present

554
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
Calls the president of all these colleges in Saint

555
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Washington

556
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
And according to David Adams he basically tells

557
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
That the rules had to be Rewritten

558
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
It had it become

559
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
A little bit more safe at least

560
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Or it would be bad

561
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
And out of that we see a couple of rules

562
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,312
First school to side in order to loosen up the

563
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
The pile

564
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
They're going to

565
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Tinker with the

566
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,968
Down yardage ratio

567
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
3 Downs of game 5 yards

568
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
3 Downs

569
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
10 yards

570
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Renounce

571
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Forward

572
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Couple years later

573
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
But the second rule

574
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
Just may be the most important first

575
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Is for the first time

576
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
They legalize the ability

577
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
To move the ball

578
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Through

579
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Free-floating

580
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
It surrounds us all

581
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,336
Okay where do we go to the next today soak if I could if I could place you in a moment

582
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Before this you'd like to hit

583
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
I believe

584
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,480
November 23rd 1907

585
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:37,088
Yes the big moment K can you set the scene

586
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,208
From the standpoint of broader American history things have gone airborne

587
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
You mean Wilbur and Orville Wright 1960

588
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
There are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world in France everyone is experimenting with line machines things

589
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Things are going up in the air

590
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
But not so fast with football because

591
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,064
When the rule committee had made that rule about for passing they'd also hedged a little bit saying

592
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
If you throw forward pass through receiver doesn't catch it

593
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
You are penalized 15 yards which back in the day with a monster amount so nobody threw the ball was too rich

594
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:22,400
Back story goes as soon as that rule got passed Pop Warner goes back to his garage

595
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
Show me the garage with a ball

596
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,800
And he starts experimenting and what would be the most efficient way

597
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Costas

598
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,688
People have to understand that the footballs knows days are not the footballs we have today with the nice

599
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,760
Oblate spheroid or whatever they call it

600
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
With a nice points and thinks he's a rugby ball

601
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
Citic imagine that deflated basketball

602
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,928
They're thicker in the middle they're not as well shaped

603
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
They're really tough to get your hand on

604
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
It's all right

605
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
And in 1906

606
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,680
In Albert exendine Zorro history we talked about this in 1906

607
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
He says called all the players together

608
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
He tells them

609
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
You would have to learn

610
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,456
Carla ball

611
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Spiral the ball

612
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Cuz if you throw the ball in the spiral it gets

613
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
10 times less Air drag

614
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
And if you throw it and over and plus it's easier

615
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,816
They start experimenting with it a little bit in in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense

616
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Which gets us to that game

617
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
November 23rd 1907 Carlyle place the University of Chicago last game of the season were in Chicago

618
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,384
And the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation V best

619
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Will Carlos good at this point though

620
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah but Chicago

621
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Stagg field

622
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,344
And they're 27000 people in the stands

623
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:51,744
Well what happened was the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative

624
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
Forward passing by Justice

625
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,656
Knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage

626
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
Until Carlisle's greatest receiver Albert exendine our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minutes ball

627
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
Snap Chicago players wood

628
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,688
Hit him and try to throw him down or knocking out of bounds

629
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
So

630
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,088
Pop Warner said the exendine here's what we're going to do next time they hit you out of bounds

631
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Sneak around the bench and get back on the field

632
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,976
By some accounts with X and idea but

633
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
On the next play

634
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,120
I would like to dine at expected ends up out of bounds

635
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
But it keeps running

636
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,544
He runs around the back of the bench spectators

637
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
Maybe around the van and comes back on the field

638
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Reddit that moment

639
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle

640
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Lex Luthor vicious spiders

641
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
Can I have your recently shitbag

642
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,720
This is Sally's description of that moment from her book the real All-American

643
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,560
For a moment it was a frozen scene in a stage drama

644
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,168
The ball hung in the air a tantalizing possibility

645
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Could exendine reach it

646
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Woody catch it

647
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
Or drop it Defenders will then stare down field

648
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
Spectators watching from the stands

649
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
Redhead died in their Collective throats the spiraling ball

650
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Defy physics

651
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
What made it stay up

652
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
When will it come down

653
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,928
In that long moment 27000 spectators

654
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
Mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms

655
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,376
May have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion

656
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
I have noticed something they never had before

657
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,312
Set a ball traveling through space traces of profoundly elegant path

658
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
They may have realized something else

659
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
That it was beautiful

660
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
The ball struck is human target

661
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Action done caught the pass all alone

662
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
And trotted over the Chicago line

663
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
The stadium exploded

664
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Sound in motion it was the game break it the rest was just anticlimax

665
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
The final score was 18244 Carlisle

666
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
But very next year the ivy league pass is a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back on

667
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
That's what a real company

668
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,352
Description of the ball in the air

669
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Is

670
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Timeless

671
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,264
Anyway that's exactly why football is still beautiful

672
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
For the time that's that's that's when

673
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes to sport that you watched

674
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Oh wow this is

675
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
This is the fee can we get out

676
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
After we spent an entire day looking at pictures of

677
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
You know Albert exendine in

678
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,288
Pride Pop Warner and doulas Lone Wolf

679
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Lino and all these

680
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,432
Carlisle players Barbara and Carol took us to the field where they practice

681
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,736
Answer this is the Carlyle

682
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Indian School football field

683
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
Covered in snow

684
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,720
410 degrees out here really really bright sun coming off this now

685
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
And sit empty

686
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
And we just kind of walked around and

687
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Try to imagine all the stuff

688
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
We just seen in photos

689
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
He was a little bit like walking among ghosts

690
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
That's the sound of the flag blowing in the back

691
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Understanding on that feel the end

692
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Having the

693
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Thought that I couldn't quite art

694
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Calculate

695
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,936
The later of Eric Anderson a professor from Haskell

696
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Remember the Potawatomi Nation

697
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Surprise finger on it

698
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
He said she said that like there's a lot of room on a football field

699
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Minutes from 4

700
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Anger

701
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
And war and violence is also room

702
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Pride

703
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Kind of coming together that's not a pratt coming together where one side gets erased but it is it coming

704
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
Together there is a middle ground

705
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
Clearly it's more than a game

706
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,168
The stakes are higher than that

707
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
You know

708
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,056
Will we as Indian people be accepted

709
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
On our own terms

710
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Also

711
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
In our ability

712
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
To meet you

713
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Halfway

714
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Will we be accepted

715
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Through

716
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
This as the vehicle

717
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,328
It's clearly more than the game

718
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
A lot of people to think of this episode I we had original music made for us for that episode from Morgan Oak

719
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
Cocaine you can hear him right here playing the banjo that's Morgan Oakland music.

720
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Come check them out

721
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,888
Also add original music from Austin musician Shakey Graves

722
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,288
India Albert exendine take that we played as from the research division of the Oklahoma Historical Society

723
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,384
Cumberland County Historical Society in the US Army Heritage and education center

724
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Where you can go and see

725
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,016
Tons of photos from both archives or you can come to us on our website radiolab.org we have

726
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Ton of old archival

727
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Football picks

728
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Nunavut

729
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
