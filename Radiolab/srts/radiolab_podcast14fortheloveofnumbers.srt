Like this

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
This is Alex Bellos

00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
Okay he's a writer he's written a lot about sports a particular Brazilian soccer but also mathur he likes

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
And

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
When I sweat my face my butt

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Here's looking at Euclid

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
Irritate me because

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
My bicep that have a favorite number

21
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
You don't have a favorite number

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
No I think it's stupid

23
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,368
I did think it was stupid

24
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,136
I just didn't have

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,744
Where when why would the question annoying to me it's the most normal question you could ask

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,376
But this is my number this is this is he's talking about a math book to math enthusiasts what's your favorite number is

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Like sort of a

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,008
It's like it's too silly or maybe it's like they making fun of them once

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
I think I was bit tired it was like

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
What's your favorite number

31
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
Turning it back at the post in the old days

32
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
And they said

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Oh 12

34
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
You weren't asking me because you were kind of taking the piss out of the 👄

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Actually really wanted to know

36
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696

37
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
Antidepressant

00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm in my mind 7

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
This is interesting and I can remember about who he is going to favorite number

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
At least half the people put their hands up

42
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
In a wave

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,456
UK from being a smoker when you stop smoking to be I went from being

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Agnostic

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,856
Obsessed with favorite website favorite number

46
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
I know just asking people to hit the question I put it out of that

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
And I helped them out on my blog and I had within the first few weeks I sleep over 30,000 people

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
How high

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
From all over the world

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
My name is sattar from Dubai Aaron skit

00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Sydney Australia my favorite number is definitely 8:30

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,504
29:11 of the reasons why reasons for is because my favorite card is there

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Spades

54
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
It's commonly called the death card my birth date

55
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
414

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
59 Saum 5 from 9

57
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,584
For my favorite number is 100 because it has two zeros

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Okay here's what's fascinating about this least of me first of all

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
The volume of

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Response he got about

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
30000 submissions

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
All over the planet

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
We put out a call in our app

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Which are the voices you listen to

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Hiiraan

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
We got 30000

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
No

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,160
I clearly people want to talk about their favorite numbers and about the reasons which are

69
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
From the

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
The number 5

71
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Was always a friend

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Feels Like Home and Family

73
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
It's kind of hole and balance people talked about it any motion

74
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
Really warm is

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Home Instead office just inviting

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Is this a hole in

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Emotional landscape

78
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,664
Sitting here under the number 2 nothing to do the number

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
They are it was there from the very

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
Where do numbers come who invented

81
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Well it depends what you mean by number

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,792
If my numbers mean this idea that we can tell the difference between two things and three things

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Well then we've had that ever since

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
The humans existed and

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
You can test on animals

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
But if you're talking about symbol

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
And worth

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
Abstractions to designate specific numbers

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
This is probably only about 5000 years old

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
And was an invention of the Sumerians

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
Iraq and Alex's from the moment they came up with

92
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Lantana

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
Extra layers

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,392
Utterly unknown number e stock price

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,720
Like I just take the Sumerian word for one

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
Apologies for my accident in Sumerian

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,423
Mycenaeans been very rough

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Guess

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Which is GES

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Japan

101
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Or have you

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Say that that's the word for one and that is also the word and the word for two

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,623
Mend meaning of the word for woman and one can anybody speculate but there

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
Why one is mad

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
It was women it could be

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
Could be they had some sort of Adam and Eve

107
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Notion in mind like me first

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
You second

109
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Could be

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
I'll distinguishing feature is

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
We have one of

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
What makes up a mine

113
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
And that woman has

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Two breasts

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,663
Whatever they were thinking they were not the only ones to be thinking along

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
You go forward three thousand years

117
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
3000 years later you get to

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Pythagorean

119
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Yes it is repeated

120
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
The one is male to female

121
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Thanks

122
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
By saying that

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Old numbers

124
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Masculine

125
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Even numbers

126
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
What's feminine even tried to justify besides little to do that do the calculation

127
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
When you add even to odd

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Say 3 + 2

129
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
You get all

130
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
5

131
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Which means that when you add

132
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Man swimming to get man said man

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Is coming stronger

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
Shenzhen women

135
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
By that logic odd plus odd

136
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Makes even

137
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,159
What is that two males make a female I mean it the whole thought is

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
A little far-fetched to me

139
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
So that is Steve Stroker

140
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,119
Professor of math at Cornell regular on our show friend of Radiolab

141
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Thinking about

142
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,383
But here's what's weird is it you'll go 5000 years after the Sumerians it right up to the present time when Alex does

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Is this worldwide survey

144
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
What's your favorite number

145
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
You something

146
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,599
Beauty familiar I will just read you for example

147
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
Some of the adjectives

148
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
In reasons why people

149
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Preferred the number one

150
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Strong strong

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
Independent

152
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Honest Brave

153
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Brave

154
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Pioneering

155
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Lonely lonely

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Cowboys lose your tablet words

157
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
A picture of the number one

158
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,479
A man in a really nicely tailored Italian suit he's got dark hair

159
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
I don't know why

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Marcello mastroianni

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
John Wayne

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
2

163
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Kolaches

164
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Wise

165
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Pretty

166
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
Soft nurturing

167
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Call Rodger

168
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Very personal

169
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Unintimidated

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Friendly sympathetic

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Complimentary

172
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
Easy-to-understand flexible

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Makes more sense

174
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
Become feminine

175
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Estereotipo

176
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
These are both men and women

177
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Contributing these descriptors for these two not number

178
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah yeah that was really striking to me and it made me think

179
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
We could always offer Pythagoras in the Sumerians and all the candidates

180
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
People saying well one is male and Taurus female

181
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,303
It's some fragments of that remain

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
What does raises not like

183
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
A scientific study

184
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Well actually

185
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
The movie look

186
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
There's kind of some science

187
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Behind it

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
In fact there's a guy

189
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Understudy

190
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
A place you know

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
James Wilkie assistant professor of the University of Notre Dame so James what they do

192
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
Take a baby that's just been born to be a few weeks old

193
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Impossible to say

194
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
Just for the face whether it's a boy or girl

195
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
I'll see you together 50s

196
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,583
They show people pictures of you androgynous little babies and buried over in the side

197
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
We would hardly notice

198
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
The heartstrings of

199
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
4 5 digit numbers

200
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
Numbers having to either all even or all odd

201
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
Right and James guy say don't worry about it

202
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
They they're their there for the storage

203
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
These are tracking numbers

204
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
Go ahead and ignore these just focus on the babies in the

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Pictures and tell a male or female

206
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Just look at the face and tell us whether to Mahler if he had it turns out that if a baby is next to all digits

207
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
You're more likely

208
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
Say that it's a boy

209
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
That if the baby is next

210
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Even digit

211
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Really

212
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,447
Whip with a how much more likely by a lot or buy a teeny bit

213
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Statistically significant amount not allowed

214
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
Do you yourself assign any gender to other one do you find odd

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Other than one male

216
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,527
And some no not at all

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
No no

218
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
They were a bit different

219
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Feel different

220
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
So he decided to invest

221
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Just to see if there's anything behind it

222
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Yeah why not

223
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
Which led him a note to a guy named Greg

224
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Roland okay

225
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,935
Okay this is Robert producer working with Robert

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
Can you just tell if you have a peculiar job I guess

227
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,871
Ashley's peculiar to me like what what do you do well I found it

228
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Put the semiotic Alliance

229
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Which is a business

230
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
It is a consultant

231
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
See ya the Greg is

232
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Hey very good money by some of the biggest brands in the world Coca-Cola for by BM to give them advice about how

233
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
How the Browns will go down we

234
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
Look at people's emotional response

235
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,815
Is to coccia symbols and ideas on the basis of this we can help

236
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Companies with packaging habit

237
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,983
Appetizing and what that means is he's helping companies harness the symbolic power of numbers

238
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
I think one of the most exciting

239
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,127
Encounters with mathematics for me was with KFC

240
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
With the 11 herbs and spices

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,255
11 which is kabbalistic and it's in his secrecy

242
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:13,375
Such a strange number for I thought the Colonel Sanders was in his experimental kitchen

243
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Understand you just happened

244
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
He said

245
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,103
Colonel Sanders was in his kitchen and he was just fiddling around he came up with 11

246
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Herbs

247
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,711
Because it hurts here and spice well that's one version of the truth but

248
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
The symbolic tree

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
It's far more interesting and potent

250
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
11 has an enormous

251
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Mystical potential simply because it's not

252
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,535
10 or 12:05 is not a sensible number what's wrong with 10

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
If I say

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,447
With my 10 herbs and spices with 10 you implying that you have a decimal.

255
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
It's going to hop it very hard to engage people emotionally

256
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
With with Tenten feels order

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Feels

258
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Heidi rational

259
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
Racism and something to do with the fact you have only

260
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
10 fingers are looking

261
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
And a 7-Eleven just is that extra water

262
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
That has

263
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Made Colonel Sanders

264
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
Uncopyable and the same thing might be happening with 501 jeans like

265
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
The why is it 501j

266
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
And not

267
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
5 of 1

268
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Again it's just the one Beyond

269
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
The place you would expect to get

270
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
But way to say what if you don't want

271
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
What if you want a product

272
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Where you get plates safe

273
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Well

274
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,943
Then you can stick with multiples of 10 which is really useful when you're trying to be

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,503
Practical or scientific absolute

276
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
Free sample

277
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
We're winning the war against it take the acne cream oxy 10

278
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
You and your face I know you're not entirely comfortable

279
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
The tender is obviously you know that's where we get to a solution that's where all fingers are has run out

280
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
So there is a sense of completion there

281
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,591
Censored we go through the process and we're going to come out okay

282
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,735
Equus sy11 that is interesting cuz you're you're a barking into the infinite

283
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
I'm at that point you're going to be on the human finger account

284
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
11

285
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Herbs and spices

286
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Triton

287
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Now

288
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Did you say that as if you want to taste the thing I do like I used to

289
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,639
Is it did the 11 is the 11 number 11 some tickle you in anyway yes

290
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,247
Definitely would not buy it with 10 herbs and spices that sounds very solid and

291
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Stalinist

292
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Really

293
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
No I'm yanking I'm yanking I'm yanking your Wishbone

294
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
I don't mean it no come on

295
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,887
I got to go to Steve like the idea that 11 is Mystical because it's one more than 10

296
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Although with 10 if you get

297
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
It is boring

298
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
I agree you're just a fact

299
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Big companies with large checkbooks

300
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Call Greg up all the time

301
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
Stupid thing about numbers is it because they are so rational

302
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
ISO abstract

303
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Adult very reason

304
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Boston Subway Bazaar

305
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,879
I think human beings have it absolutely needs to invest

306
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Emotion love hate fear who vested non-rational

307
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
Into things which seem almost obscenely rational

308
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
My magic number

309
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Is number eight

310
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
I turned

311
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
8

312
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
Teen on October 18th 1988 number for because I've won

313
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,039
Swimming race in Maine for as a child

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Because to me it recalls to mind

315
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
The Trinity know how are you feeling about all this

316
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
Steph one thing that you pretty interesting to Alex as you'd expect if you were asked

317
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
The world to give you a favor

318
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
The number that be a huge difference

319
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
From one culture

320
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
The next 13 is an unlucky number you don't have a 13th

321
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Flooring America

322
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,079
In Korea they didn't have a fourth floor cuz it's unlucky for over there

323
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
But here's something

324
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,735
The entire planet all the continents and everyone in all the continents

325
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
Came to kind of consensus around 1

326
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Yeah so tell me

327
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Alex

328
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
What was

329
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
The worlds

330
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Favorite number

331
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
I hope you got some good with a drum roll coming up movies

332
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
787 my favorite number is 7 number is number 7

333
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Much the same thing

334
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
It's like a pixel 3

335
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
Acai places that nobody was a big win for 7:30 % ahead of 3

336
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Feel is the favorite number

337
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
But why is it the peep

338
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
People's favorite number

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
And when did that begin and I have one

340
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Oh great I love hearing reason holes in your head

341
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Years

342
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
2 + 21

343
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Narcissist

344
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Looking for

345
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Yai 607

346
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Seven Hills

347
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
There's no way that can

348
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Well then look up at the night sky and be a Mesopotamians you don't have a telescope what do you see the sun

349
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
On the moon at 5 Planet 7

350
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Turn all night looking at 7

351
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
That's not what you hear

352
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,367
Number 7 just looks beautiful what you hear from people is about how big

353
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Beautiful

354
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
I like the way it looks when I write it was good-looking number

355
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
Sounds beautiful sons perfect people came in

356
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Sound

357
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
I get on that train I think 7 comes out of your mouth real nice

358
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Set

359
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
I just don't feel like the number 7

360
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Belongs to me

361
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
May I guess

362
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
It even sounds good in Arabic

363
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Yeah

364
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Hebrew Sheva

365
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Really similar

366
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,295
Sit this makes me feel a little

367
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Sad

368
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
Not to get silly on you but

369
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
There's a certain pleasure that people are getting that I'm not getting

370
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Prime numbers

371
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Ever cuz

372
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
I feel like

373
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
Like someone says 8 is curvy

374
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Artemis

375
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Feels

376
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
You're talking about the shape of the way that we draw them

377
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
The number 8 as a numeral

378
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
That has nothing to do with the number 8

379
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,175
It's the way I see you say 8 to me I see

380
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
I don't see eight apples I see that curd I see the two circles one on top of another resting Comfort makes me that makes me sad

381
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
That makes me feel like you're missing the reality of the number 8 which is

382
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
The date has intrinsic

383
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
Property that's really dry speak

384
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
At 8

385
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
8 is a

386
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
I mean

387
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Like 10 okay 10 to me

388
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
Is much more like when you go to the bowling alley

389
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
And the Ten Pins are lined up in that triangle pattern

390
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
You know what I'm talking about there's the one and the two than the 304

391
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
That is a gorgeous way to think about 10

392
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
10 is about this magnificent symmetry that can make a triangle

393
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
But seven is a disaster as a mathematical

394
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Object

395
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
I mean

396
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
It doesn't have nice symmetry

397
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,279
If I tried to put bowling pins down with 7 it's it's ugly however you arrange it

398
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Tumi

399
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,655
So it makes me feel left out that I can't have the same fun

400
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
That other people are having

401
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,847
Okay but if you ask Alex why is 7 the world's favorite number

402
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
He says

403
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
Because seven is arithmetic

404
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Glee unique

405
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Is the only digit

406
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
The first 10 numbers

407
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
Can either be multiplied

408
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
O divided

409
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Within the group

410
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,535
So 1 2 3 4 5 we can double them and they stay under temp in the group

411
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
6

412
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
What's left

413
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
I have 6 8 and 10

414
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
As you can

415
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
And the ones laugh

416
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
7 + 9

417
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
And then you can divide by 3

418
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
So

419
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
7

420
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Is unique

421
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,687
Do you think that there's enough arithmetic in everybody

422
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
I without having worked it out as painfully as you just did

423
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
People will

424
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
Still fine there's something unusual about 7

425
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Mathematica

426
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,511
Not about memories not about culture not about shave just about the method self

427
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
You can't separate the math world of those things the weight we

428
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,911
Understand numbers is to do with a rhythmic

429
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
And it's the arithmetic is being absorbed by culture

430
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
The greatest example of that

431
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
Is the predominant

432
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Ab7

433
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
As the most

434
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,967
Special religious mystical number. There is

435
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
So you thinks it's not so much

436
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
That they culture has gotten in the math still around at the math actually was there first and then Dad got into the culture

437
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Alright you making me feel better

438
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
Would you like to thank somebody I would I like to thank Steve Stroh gas once again for joining us whenever we call her

439
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
I like to thank Alex Bellos

440
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,343
The book is called The Grapes of math how life reflects numbers and numbers

441
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,463
Hey we should go again I'm Jedi

442
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
Thanks for listening

443
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
Christine Quintana from Vancouver BC

444
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Radio

00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Is the port in part by the National Science Foundation

446
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
By the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

447
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151

Technology in the modern world

450
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
More information about Sloan

451
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Www.
