1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,600
Hi I'm Robert and I'm left if not he's Radiolab and today we're going to do something completely upside down

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:31,744
And inside out yes if it's a sports story sort of would like none you've ever heard and therefore

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,608
We found a reporter who is a sports reporter like none you've ever heard I've been to a gym light

6
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Mike Pesca is the host of the gist

7
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,544
Podcast by slate formerly of NPR still sometimes Roost NPR

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
And now he's here telling a story.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,808
So this is Morning Edition from NPR news

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
I'm Renee Montagne

11
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,648
Who's covering the 2012 Olympics for NPR

12
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Good morning

13
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
And the games of London

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
The stories of the Olympics

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
You try to find your own stories that are obscure but if there's a big store you chase it Sonos Olympics

16
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
What were the most notable at

17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
In the first

18
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Tweak of the gates

19
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
Well if history of the basscon

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Michael Phelps breaking the all-time record obviously.

21
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,600
I never knew that a bolt

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,184
And his record-setting quest in the hundred would be huge

23
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Brewery

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
But

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,448
Tennis badminton story pops up

26
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
And everyone rushes to figure out what the heck

27
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Going on with Dad Minton

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
2012 London Olympics badminton

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Tournament

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
It took

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,416
This somewhat obscure Sport and it morphed it into this Bizzaro thotics

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
About

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Competition

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Integrity and

35
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
What it means to win quotes

36
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Mostly

37
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
I think that

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Although to be fair

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Mike

40
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
He jumped on the story for

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Very personal recent as a New Yorker I say a lot of words and their mispronouncing the NPR audience

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
Jump on them but I always can say the n in badminton and get a lot of

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,832
Claudette so I'm attracted to badminton badminton

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Into some

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,744
Hand wear at wintertime chastising a playful cat

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
And then also

47
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
You know you probably think of badminton as this

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Backyard

49
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Fun

50
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Silly games but

51
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
According to Mike no this is anything but

52
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,176
It has nothing to do with the badminton you play in your backyard

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,296
It's much faster than you think it would possibly look

54
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,904
Flying all over the court stretching reaches diving

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,976
On a scale of the competitors is you know

56
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Readily apparent

57
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:22,240
And perhaps not as impressive a thing as a tennis ball but it looks a lot like tennis

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
And there's a lot of

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Tension

60
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,408
Severe pressure and there's a lot of grunting

61
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,296
I need totally seems like every bit of our legitimate and highly-skilled

62
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Sports

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Okay so

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
So Robert so you haven't seen

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
But I would like to show you something

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Senad

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Okay

68
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
This is the game that is at the center of the

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
This whole story

70
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Women's doubles

71
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Badminton

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
It is not a metal round it's in the group place

73
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Staged

74
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
The huge crowd are like the

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Place is packed

76
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Chili's too

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,911
Teams come out you got China yellow

78
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Same here,

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Versus

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
Korea purple and white

81
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
And what's

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Task if I had here

83
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Alright so here we go game on this is the first sir

84
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
Rampant Korean serve

85
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
So the Korean player

86
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
Flicks her wrist

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
DeFalco's over the net

88
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
China returns

89
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Right into the net that was the whole thing

90
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,119
Cuz I was just

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Second serve

92
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Chinese return

93
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
So that service is turned over now the Chinese are so

94
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
China Korea China

95
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,415
What does not exactly single and I've got to tell you

96
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
This next

97
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
The Korean player serves it

98
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Yeah

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,655
It's sales over the net and then it goes goes goes goes goes and the

100
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Chinese player

101
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
Clearly he's right there he has it

102
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
She then whines up justice

103
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,175
White big like you could see it's like she has this deep ingrained muscle memory from years of doing it

104
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
She wants up she's about to hit it and then she stopped

105
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
And the shocks

106
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Trunks under the floor

107
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Inbounds

108
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Queen Taqueria

109
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
And then

110
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Tellingly

111
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
She looks

112
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Back corner of the

113
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
The court where coach

114
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
They both are

115
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
This is a fix

116
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Spell fixing this

117
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Like this is

118
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
But different plenty of occasions were one side wants to lose and then hard to lose

119
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,919
Any more important thing is it ain't hard to get away with it usually you wouldn't even

120
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Notice

121
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
You know it's a difference between a couple serves

122
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
I over the line a couple balls into the net

123
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
In this case as the match goes on you start to realize

124
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
Seemed to be trying to lose to

125
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Well it's actually a strategy

126
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,615
Because the wizard tournament is laid out both these teams

127
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Are going to be moving on to the metal ramp

128
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
But

129
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Whoever wins

130
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,623
This game is going to have to play another Chinese team a really strong team icing

131
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,743
And whoever loses is going to play a way easier Danish.

132
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
So boots

133
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Teams

134
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Are hoping

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Toulouse

136
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Yeah and it is the rare instance

137
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Where you at Boost

138
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
Sides incentivised to lose

139
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
That you get something that should be scored by Spike Jones

140
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
A little bit of a prisoner's dilemma right

141
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
At either side could lose but when both want to lose it because this

142
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
Surreal waiting game

143
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
Right now who's going to crack first

144
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
And squirrel point and so

145
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
You got the best players in the world

146
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
Start hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds that's on purpose

147
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Hitting the shuttlecock into the net

148
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
They're hitting it straight into the ground all by tripping over their own shoelaces purposefully until what you get

149
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,647
Is up all into the net

150
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Durable badminton and it just devolves into this absurd repetitive

151
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Crazy making

152
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Louis Vuitton

153
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Is not sleeping spice

154
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
So obvious

155
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
I mean this

156
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Not this

157
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
Is not sport this is kind of a sport because

158
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
And this is why I really love it

159
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,807
At a certain point these two teams have to start competing with each other

160
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Toulouse

161
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Let me play you this point

162
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Tilt

163
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,767
China serves at Korea it back but it's going way out of bounds

164
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,399
Now in a normal World China would obviously let that fall so that they can take a point but they lunge

165
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Save it

166
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Right there getting it back

167
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
North Korea then they are like no no you know what we're pretty sure we wanted in the opposite direction

168
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Even further out of bounds

169
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
Tenille Traina goes to save it once again but they don't get there in time so the point goes to China which China actual

170
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
He didn't want the Koreans wanted those

171
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
So what are you saying then

172
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Invented a whole new sport which is

173
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,863
The exact opposite of badminton it is it is photo negative Batman

174
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
But then

175
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
Towards the end of the first sat

176
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Outcomes a referee

177
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,503
Hello toaster speaking thorsten Baron was the head Olympic badminton referee who got the

178
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
And I also heard these Spectators pool so I went to watch

179
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
It it looks

180
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
Pretty old for this was not right

181
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
In the past and

182
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Chosen that they were

183
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Not playing seriously

184
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
And they will making a very serious mistake and that they played stupid and set now who playing with Ryan

185
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Krohn Conservatory

186
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,175
We were actually able to get in touch with

187
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
Three of the four players in that match

188
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Both Korean players

189
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
End

190
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Kim Hunter

191
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,023
And also one of the Chinese players

192
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,703
Do you want and once you lie told me they were trying to lose in that match what to expect

193
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
South Korea would they do the same thing

194
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Has the mail song

195
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
And as for the Koreans

196
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
Junction and said that they too

197
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
We're trying to lose at least During certain moments in the game

198
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,343
But when the crowd started to do

199
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
Her partner Kim ha-na said that's how a surprise in

200
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Embarrassed

201
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
We just wanted to get out of the Courts

202
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
As soon as possible

203
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,727
So person walks off the court they window court again and then the

204
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Second

205
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Serve

206
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
After twisting wants out the court

207
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Nothing but net

208
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
So for the next few points

209
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,247
It does not get much better

210
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Hopewell

211
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
So beset comes to an end

212
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Korean Society

213
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
And while the players are waiting on the sidelines

214
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
You come again horse then comes back onto the court he walks up to the players and he pulls out of his

215
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,519
The players this black card

216
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
The black car which means disqualification

217
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Is

218
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
Absolutely extraordinary

219
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
He has given Bose

220
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Teams

221
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
A black card

222
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
I'm ready

223
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Turbie show displays have written

224
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
2 quarts

225
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,791
It was now that they should play or they would be in

226
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Deep

227
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Sorry but maybe I shouldn't affect the back

228
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,615
Was out and I would like told them in 63 in very clear words and very seriously

229
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
In order to help themselves

230
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
They better

231
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Play now

232
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Shenanigans

233
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,255
I told her there and them and we are we so come get her

234
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Richest play

235
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
And do our best

236
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Second set starts

237
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
Pretty quick China

238
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:33,151
Size-change salad

239
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
But then as the points kept coming you started to notice like they were playing very slowly.

240
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:46,207
They were not getting the poor very hot

241
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Shelby said that booth

242
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Team Stephen change the basic

243
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Fact or still trying to lose

244
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
How to say is exactly what it looks like when you watch it

245
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
It's for the rest of the match

246
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
You get a bunch of these points were like we're just built

247
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
Wabbit super high you know as if to say hey

248
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Smash it down on us take your point

249
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,831
Or they will you know hit it out of bounds and then facepalm

250
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Just

251
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,927
You'll practice their swing after they missed one just did

252
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
Two seats aob on my mechanics are off I just got to just practice

253
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
This is a few more time

254
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
Because it's like we've entered a whole third iteration of this game where it's like they're not just trying to lose

255
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
They're trying to

256
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,847
Cover up that you're trying to lose but you're kind of look like you're trying to win

257
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,991
I don't think you're seeing anybody here

258
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
So finally after 20 long minutes

259
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Of this

260
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
The

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Korean team

262
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Loses

263
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
The match

264
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
By winning

265
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
Tonight has left me with a great and nasty taste in the mouth tonight does not support

266
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
It was a disgrace

267
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Good night

268
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Community

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
So all four players

270
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Walks off the court

271
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
And

272
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
Kim ha-na Pleasant

273
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
Winning it all in Aaron's

274
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Somewhere in the audience

275
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Saturday

276
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
And afterwards they ask her

277
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
What

278
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
What happened then

279
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
Why do you have to get the booze from the audience's

280
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
And etcetera and I will I was

281
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
I was

282
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Sad and feel felt defeated so

283
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
I didn't even want to talk to my mom so I remember

284
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
I just went to the

285
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Hotel in

286
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Head thrust

287
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Shut down

288
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Kill me.

289
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
And the next morning at 8

290
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Order for pests in fact work

291
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
Disqualified according to the disciplinary regulations of

292
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
The badminton World Federation which has a rule on the books

293
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
State you can beat

294
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Disqualified

295
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
For failing to use your best effort

296
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,119
And the same evening they were on the train home they were just thrown out of the Olympic

297
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
Text scandal at the

298
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Is Holton

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
Players everyone was talking about some losers

300
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Shuffle Council guy now

301
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
Tippy toppy in the shuttlecock into the net

302
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
Was just

303
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Sac that the

304
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
They were

305
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
Committing suicide in that tournament

306
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,583
Look at that time the punishment

307
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
Hit me quite hard I was very sad

308
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
And I felt

309
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Helpless

310
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
Tune your own phone numbers perplexed and didn't know

311
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919

312
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Scryed

Just didn't sound like

314
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,647
Get any better but they're still more after the break

315
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

327

And I'm here because I need your

328
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
And I request

329
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids

330
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
Parents uncles teachers

331
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,183
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

332
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Brilliance

333
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Basically I want to hear about this

334
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Times when a kid you know did something

335
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
It just means you lean back and say

336
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Well

337
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Maybe it was the moment that I

338
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
Kids started reading back

339
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Do you

340
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

341
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
And you suddenly noticed they were doing

342
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
Or maybe the kids in math class you notice their writing used

343
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Stick in the margin of their geometry

344
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
We're interested in the

345
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,207
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart

346
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
It doesn't have anything to do with it

347
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535

We're back I'm Robert krulwich this is Radio app

357
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,839
Korean and Chinese women's badminton team had just been disqualified

358
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Kicked out of the Olympics

359
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
So what so then what happened to the

360
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
Play The Players like root what happened to all four of them did

361
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
Keep playing badminton professionally after this

362
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,407
Jung kyung Hoon from Korea even went on to win the bronze in Rio

363
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
But at the time this

364
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Was a

365
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Brutal punishment

366
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
For all of them

367
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Well but you know later

368
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
They did something wrong just wasn't right

369
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,207
You know I don't even I question whether it's

370
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Even on acid

371
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
I think it's ethical

372
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
It away what they did

373
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
How so

374
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
Is the definition of ethics in Sports 2

375
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Twin Shore

376
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Without using yes

377
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Does that mean to win every

378
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Point

379
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
No not necessarily you know in baseball there's a thing called the intentional water in football

380
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
Call a team will take a safety

381
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Instead of

382
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Pumping and letting the other team score a touchdown

383
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
What is a calculation where

384
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Appoint

385
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,071
Cure there is not as important as the whole in the whole is the game

386
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Pan out a little more

387
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,495
I think an individual game is off and we're not going to put our good starter here

388
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
We're going to manage the lineup

389
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
50 goal is to win the championship

390
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
Anything to remember about these players is

391
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
If what we want

392
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Is players who are

393
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
Hypercompetitive them actually want to win at all costs

394
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
That's exactly why they were losing so badly

395
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
Because they wanted to win the overall championship at all cost

396
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
At the badminton Federation had a set of rules that open guarantee that this would happen

397
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Stupid to have an event

398
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
What people are trying to lose to get that event is a sporting event

399
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
It's a especially at the Apex

400
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
Near the only time people care about Badness it seems really Chuck Klosterman we called him in

401
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Because he writes a lot about sports and also because

402
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
He wrote the ethicist column for the New York Times magazine

403
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
No is this a

404
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Some kind of tragedy well it's not

405
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,303
I guess unless badminton is really important to you than it probably is

406
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
In this case I think

407
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
The thing that people got really upset about is this

408
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,727
Is this idea of the Olympic ideal

409
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Athletes

410
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,735
Gloria the song

411
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
To transcend the it in the way that Isaac

412
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,927
Super Bass what you're sending your Humanity but then also as like this representative of your country and

413
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
I think it did poke a lot of

414
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
People like a lot of people did seemingly get

415
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Kind of upset about

416
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
Yeah I mean

417
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
For some reason it is disturbing to

418
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
To see

419
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Athens Family camper

420
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Adjusted

421
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
It seems to

422
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Kind of like

423
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Happened some

424
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Like I somehow

425
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Yes

426
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Like like like I don't know if

427
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,623
Not trying in a sporting event is moral question but it feels that way when you see it happen

428
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Chicken what do you think about sports is that we watch these adults

429
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Playing multimillion-dollar games

430
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Same games that

431
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
With a 6 year old and 7 year old place

432
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
So when you have a 7 year old kid

433
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
You would say

434
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
It doesn't matter if you win or lose doesn't matter what happens

435
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
Just play hard

436
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
You don't have to succeed

437
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
It's the trying that matters

438
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,943
So when you see people at the highest level not trying

439
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
There's it's almost

440
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
It's sort of

441
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
Rex the entire idea of why we play sports at all you know why if you're at a playground in two kids racing

442
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
The playground to see who can get to the swing faster whatever like

443
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,072
Biological thing maybe we are biologically driven to compete

444
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,192
So that's the Baseline expectation of what we have of these badminton players that they will try to compete

445
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,544
But it seems to me there's an opportunity here for True athleticism in a kind of

446
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,664
Topsy Turvy website and reverse it and see if you can do that as well as you do the other one

447
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
I mean

448
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,784
Sports only work one way though they don't work both ways

449
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
I mean it would be it would be like going to your wife

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
I'm saying like Okay you say you really love me

451
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Prove it

452
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
By hating me in a creative way

453
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Piano

454
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
Bang your fist against the keys

455
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
In a way that I will be

456
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:08,384
You know I will be sickened by matters of the heart put it back on the field

457
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
What would be the most radical

458
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
Solution that you could be mad

459
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
If your desire was

460
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
Vincent Lee and astonishingly athletically

461
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
I suppose if they were both trying to do it in the most convincing way it would be

462
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:30,656
That was not really the case here they never confronted how do you lose on purpose if the other side's all

463
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Also trying to lose on purpose

464
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
I'm trying to think there are some sports oh in football licey in American football with they both sides one

465
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,760
You can't make the other team score but you can score a safety on yourself

466
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
Do the quarterback would get the ball and start running towards his own end zone

467
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
And then there be a jailbreak

468
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,512
By the defense to tackle the quarterback

469
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
You could hit the batter

470
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
That would be that would be an interesting game what about darts better aiming at the dartboard to turn around Amy at europol

471
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
Think about the implications

472
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,344
Will Ferrell movie I guess that's what I've been thinking

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
This is what we need you got to go out there a little

474
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Other team

475
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
You can hear more of Mike Pesca on his podcast

476
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
Just more of Chuck Klosterman

477
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,944
In his latest book but what if we're wrong

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Big thanks to all the players

479
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
To talk to us and to those

480
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064

And in addition

488
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
A special thanks to Grecia Polly Grecia was on the

489
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Indonesian badminton team in the same Olympics

490
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
And an hour after the match we featured

491
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,312
She faced off against a different Korean team

492
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
All4

493
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Players in that match were also.

494
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Disqualified for not using their best ever

495
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
First to win

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,248
She really helped us

497
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Understand

498
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
What it was like

499
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
To be in that

500
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928

And the

504
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
When's the game

505
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
At this point

I'm going to do this it's possible that even if it's the fifth time I said David Cavell wrong

509
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
But I'm going to do it once

510
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
And I got to deal with an intro of myself

And this message

525
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Here's an idea

526
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
There's an old riddle and it goes like this

527
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
A king talks to his two sons to print

528
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Zenni says here's what we're gonna do

529
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
Did you get those horses out of

530
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,352
Here's what I want you to I want to jump on your horse

531
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
What is a ride to the city

532
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
Ever horse gets a City Gate

533
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
You're going to inhale

534
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Maybe crazy

535
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
So the Two Princes look at each other

536
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
They both think

537
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
And then they jump on a horse

538
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Disney ride fast as they can

539
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Why

540
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
2

541
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,136
To reading it was at the very last minute jump off

542
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
I've been wait until the other one

543
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
I don't know are they are they planning on

544
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Just removing a section of the gate and then just

545
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
Smashing it up against the other horse

546
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Yeah

547
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
No thanks

548
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
What is the

549
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
They jumped on each other's home

550
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
They dropped on the other brother

551
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:27,200
Of course meme about that on the other
