Yes perhaps the two most prominent things I've done I was on the stuff of The Economist for many years

11
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,224
I then went from there to the bank of England where I was Deputy Governor

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,112
Taking imagine Rupert is a very knowledgeable guy absolutely

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Exchange rates

Commodity prices and haha

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Super successful guy

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,656
He's been living with his one big cavernous

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,752

About sign

19
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
I'm going to say nothing I mean like

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
Kid no clue about how the natural world around him work

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
In any way

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Literally

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Princeton

24
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
The periodic table

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
I never heard of the periodic table

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
In the last year

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
And when one day his wife

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,720
Told him he was a mammal had no idea

29
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,840
I told she was using it as a term of abuse

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
The cable many many times

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Oh that's Radioactive

32
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
When describing something he felt was bad or dangerous

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Without

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
What I meant by that

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Appraised

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,968
I guess like what was it like to be a very important person in the very important circles

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
But have this Gap

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
Well I'll tell you what I became good at bluffing

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
I was on the board of

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Number of Mining Company

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
And I hope none of my colleagues

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
From those companies a listening

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Part of being on the board met yet read all these geologist reports

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Intelligence reports

45
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
And then we would have board

46
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Discussions about a lisp

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,824
And I would sit there striking my chin in the way I hoped would look like a wise

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Jeff

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
But I didn't really have a clue what people were talking about that you didn't have

50
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
This is where it all began of course

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,392
I come from Zimbabwe and I went to school there

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
It was a boarding school the kind of school where you eat wear uniforms you play cricket

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
And for some reason if

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Extra clever

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Instead of sitting any signs at all you said he Greek

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Greek Couture

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
So it's not as they did me a huge amount of favor

58
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
So he'd always thought soon as I have time

59
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
That's what I'm doing now I'm studying science

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
For the first time the age of 71

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,136
And he's really going for it he's got a tutor for 3 hours a week

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Studying physics

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Biology and

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
The favourite

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
I have been really absorbed by Kem

66
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
I guess you are married

67
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
To a scientist is that

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Crab I am case of what is is that influencing your studies at all or

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,360
The Desert Sun point I would put this right coupled with another agreement that she would be a very helpful

70
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
Shoot it to me it was indeed she's proving to be

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
But I think there's a danger now that she's going to rather wish this she'd never encouraged me to do this cuz I

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,440
I know I never stop singing while have you noticed this

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Something it was Polly the periodic table

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
When I first discovered

75
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
I couldn't believe how elegant it was how come

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
Preston beautifully defined it or was

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
But I am

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
Very very devoted to it the end you have a copy of it close by most of the day

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
Very committed this is amazing then there are other things

80
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
Principle of electricity and how it lights up bulbs and how it then moves on in

81
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Casual around the house

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Who comes out at the other end and

83
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Things like

84
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Speed and velocity

85
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Italian accelerator

86
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
I'm cells and you talking about plants and you took about animals something as simple as that gossip water I've got

87
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Put on the table by me now

88
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
I know look at it

89
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
With a huge amount of respect

90
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
And I think my card if any I could have a look with microscope ice and see those little

91
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Molecules

92
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Agenda

93
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Single

94
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Atoms of

95
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
Oxygen and how they will join.

96
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Together

97
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Be such a delight

98
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
I can see why your wives like rolling her eyes would

99
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
Buford go to bed

100
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
It sounds very much to me like you falling in love

Yeah it does it feels like that is so refreshing wonderful and exciting and you know you can

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Really believe it

103
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
It's like one day having a

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
Miracles laser surgery on your eyes Sunday

105
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Turn from being color-blind to

106
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,791
Being fully functional and seeing the richness of the world around you

107
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
I'm thinking my God in there I was

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
In that one dimensional

109
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Color

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
I know I got all of this

111
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
To Revel in

112
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
I picture you in a musical sort of like swinging

113
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Your briefcase is about as

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
No jump home from work and dance around

00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Lamppost

116
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,671
That would be nice I wouldn't recommend my dancing but anyway I

117
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
I do like the image

118
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Thanks Annie

119
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Speaking of reveling

120
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,495
And reveling in reveling in the Wonder getting back to basics

121
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,823
You'll like asking the questions you never get a chance to ask

122
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
That's what we're going to do this is one in a series of all of us are curious about

123
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
This that and the other

124
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
And some of the visitors and the Vets has and the others won't go away

125
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
I want to go to the

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,207
Show either

127
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Investigative thing right

128
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Feels like okay let's make a space for this that and the other

129
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
So we did we decided to just devote a few shows

130
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Small questions

131
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
Ask my our people that wouldn't go away so what the heck would just answer

132
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,151
Yeah and it may be in the process you get back to that repair Therrien

133
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
State of renewal

134
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Of wonder

135
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
All right so you ready Baba k i Am

136
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183
We're going to start things off with hello hello hello interrogatory duet

137
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
Producers Molly Webster this is Molly

138
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
Ariana

139
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
We had with this research

140
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
All right well my name is Oriana Aragon and I'm an assistant professor here

141
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Clemson University ok

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
She studies human behavior and emotion

143
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
So maybe you can just tell me like what made you first run into this

144
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Question

145
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Well

146
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
It was

147
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,743
Summer 2011 orellana was a grad student

148
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
Yale at the time and one night she was just sitting around watching late-night television

149
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Conan O'Brien

150
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,615
Before Leslie Bibb very beautiful talented woman you're very talented and and lovely ad

151
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Actress was on

152
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
And she was talking about having encounter this

153
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
Cute puppy woman

154
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
I was just at that

155
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Hair salon

156
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Little dog

157
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Ugly dog

158
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
It was like a Maltese

159
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Apache

160
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Tok

161
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,863
Like this little curly hair and she must have straightened with a flat iron

162
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
And then she put one ponytail holder and then another ponytail holder

163
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
The kind of look like a water ox

164
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Yeah

165
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
And then

166
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Rihanna says

167
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
Leslie did something that just sort of

168
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Struck her she started like

169
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
Gritting your teeth scrunching her face

170
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Squeezing our hands I just walked

171
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
Dog is making me so mad

172
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm going to punch it it's so cute you know she's like it's so cute you just want to smash it

173
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,167
I want to punch you make me so mad at me

174
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
And Oriana was just sitting there watching the show and she was like wow that's a strange reaction like Leslie saw this

175
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,991
Just wanted to kick it in the ass

176
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Which might seem odd

177
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,135
But is Oriana kept thinking about this moment she was like

178
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,815
Yeah we do this we do this sort of thing all the time I do that I totally do that sign out Ariana's new

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,935
When I see my baby

180
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Steve's like little body

181
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,823
My joints tense up in my hands my fingers start to curl

182
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
MIT start declensions

183
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,551
I just need to eat his face and I need to figure out what's going on here this sort of like a feeling with cuteness

184
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
What is it that we're doing and why do we do that

185
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
Back in 2011 orellana set out to answer those questions

186
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,631
And the conventional thinking of the time was that you know if this is there is an aggressive expression like gritting teeth

187
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
A clenched fist

188
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Or wanting to

189
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
Squeeze something must be representing some sort of

190
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Aggression

191
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Underneath that there's a little bit of violence

192
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
You want to hurt

193
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
That thing yes

194
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Which

195
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
Sure makes sense to me because I think my first thought is we were all cannibals at some point and I'd there

196
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
There's something in there coming through

197
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
And I'm in and it's not good in flights

198
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Society in that

199
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Is just

200
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
The urge

201
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Sneaking out

202
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
In some way

203
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
No I think it's a

204
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
Work is work is continued

205
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,823
For the last six years on this and I've found a lot I've understood a lot now about

206
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
What these Expressions communicate

207
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
And what they represent

208
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
So when Oriana first started researching this

209
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
One of the things she said figure out was

210
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
When we see something

211
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
Do we actually want to squeeze

212
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
Or is this just a

213
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Russian

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
Figure of speech I want to squeeze you

215
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
And so

216
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
She started doing these experiments where she would bring people into the lab and she would show them these pictures like a little baby duck

217
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
A little baby fluffy puppy and then give them bubble wrap

218
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,271
It's like really quiet Hall and throughout the entire semester

219
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,623
You could hear papapapapapapapa and for the really cute pics like baby

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
Ducklings you sure that's like they was just being ringing out she's above a rat that I identify with that

221
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,119
I was like bubble wrap would not cut it for me so Oriana was like okay

222
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,703
It looks like there's real aggression here but

223
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
I made it this isn't that much of a shocker

224
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
At the same time

225
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
There's actually nothing negative going on inside the

226
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
These people they were actually full of joy and happiness while they were

227
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Turn bubble wrap

228
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
So

229
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
It's not about

230
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,903
An actual latent aggression we're just we're just sort of

231
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
Expressing it this way but we don't mean it

232
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
That we're aggressive at all

233
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
But that's so

234
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Strange to have this sort of

235
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Weird

236
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Schism where you're at

237
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Happy on the inside but aggressive on the outside

238
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
It's actually not as weird as you would

239
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,639
No no Briana pointed out that in some ways it's so, and we don't even notice it

240
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
Happens all the time you see athletes for sports fans looks like absolute

241
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Fury

242
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Punching the air screaming or weeping

243
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
When something great happens

244
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
And that's another thing

245
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Think about you know

246
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Tears of joy you see brides and nuc

247
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Lottery winners

248
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
Or

249
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
You see people weeping at the off nature

250
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,599
Double complete rainbow think about all the times when

251
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
What happens on the outside the disk

252
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Play

253
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Doesn't match

254
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
What's going on on the inside

255
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,607
I saw it but I still feel like I'm at why why would you want to punch the cute puppy

256
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,959
We put the rainbow started to look at all this stuff

257
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
And having tested everything that I can think of everything that's in the literature there is a through-line to what these Express

258
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Represent and communicate

259
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
So according to Oriana

260
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
When you see tears like all kinds of Tears

261
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
Weather for winning the medal for looking at the beautiful sunset it's the same as tears at a funeral

262
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Greece communicate

263
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Wanting to stop

264
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Wanting to be

265
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Still

266
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Wanting to pause

267
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,983
And Oriana said that when it comes to these like Expressions cuz you know

268
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Now you see a cute puppy or you scored a goal or you act

269
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Actually want to fight somebody

270
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
That's about wanting to

271
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Go

272
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Wanting to move

273
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
Wanting to approach wanting to get close to

274
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
It's about

275
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Moving forward or momentum

276
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
That's funny cuz I like when I

277
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
See my baby at 4 in the morning when he

278
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Cat that wants to nurse

279
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
I'm exhaust

280
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
It's but it's not until like ice

281
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
See him in like his

282
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,959
Face lights up like you so excited to see me and if I want Alex mushroom and buy them right

283
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Like that

284
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
The thing that

285
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Get on going

286
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Pause moments

287
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Right cuz it's

288
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
That's definitely it is

289
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
It's a listener of those care behaviors

290
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
EXO

291
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
Just nice to know that in situations where like we may not know what's going on we may not be able

292
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Motel like

293
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
Read our own emotions are know how to respond to the world

294
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Most basic

295
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Bodily instincts

296
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Bailey

297
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Boil down to this

298
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Really

299
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Simple set of

300
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
Choices or like urges

301
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
You know what I think is I find myself thinking

302
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,615
In a way that I appreciate is

303
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
You know I'm not even going to get all these right but do you know what we like remember when like humans used to think of themselves

304
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Discomposed

305
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
Like fire water wind and somehow in this conversation I feel

306
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
You like all right all along it might not have been fire

307
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
It could have just been go yeah I know and maybe it wasn't water but it was

308
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Stop

309
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Yeah

310
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
That's why I'm telling you we need

311
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Self-help book

312
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Thank you Molly Webster thank you Ariana

Movies like you're welcome I'm I'm now disclaimer Molly which is

314
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
To say that Leslie Bibb is actually been on Conan

315
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
Number of times talking about how she wants to

316
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Punch

317
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,559
Dogs and and and and punch babies and in one she wants to slash Anjelica Huston face

318
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
All motivated by the same cute aggression Rihanna and her face is how she introduce yourself to an

319
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Anjelica Huston

320
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,311
So that's just to say that at the top of the Peace

321
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,455
Call happen if you got just turned around and walked away

322
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,551
Is what my as one might want to say at the top of this piece

323
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
While Oriana was in

324
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
Fired in 2011 by a Leslie and appearance

325
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
We use

326
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
A scene from 2018

327
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
Okay there was a black outfit in one

328
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
And a red outfit another got it

329
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Got it all right

330
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Okay have fun

331
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Hey Tracy

332
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Should we ask you how you

333
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Do Caillou got the idea to do this

334
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Wait. The right question

335
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,479
Start a timer but it is a question and it will do for right now

336
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Okay Tracy

337
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Facing the challenge of a completely blank

338
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,415
Page where any question at all might be legitimate

339
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
How did you land Upon This Way

340
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
So one of my friends my hair

341
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Is cat child I'm a reporter with code-switch a Tema and fear that covers racing culture and so I started tweeting one day

342
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,127
Cuz outside keep up with all my friends I just look at what they're tweeting and she was feeding how she's feeling very vulnerable right now cuz she's

343
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
Is breaking out a story that was going to involve Samson yes and so I want to know a little bit about

344
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
How did you meet Samson

345
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
I got Samson in 25

346
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
And

347
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
In 2015

348
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
This weird thing happened we're all of a sudden I became obsessed

349
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
With just wanting a dog

350
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
All of a sudden all I could do was

351
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Browse

352
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,775
These dog adoption websites in the DC area so there was like a lot of like

353
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,127
You know going to shelters and going to rescue groups in

354
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
Finally this rescue group that I think she's been in contact with email turned said

355
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,623
Want to come meet Samson and I clicked on his profile and he was really really adorable beagle mix

356
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
They had this a cute video on YouTube are you

357
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:11,839
Jumping around and he looks so happy and he's cramping in a field playing with other dogs

358
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
And the profile didn't really say much about him just said that he was a little shy he was a stray and South Carolina

359
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
And so I arranged to

360
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
You know go meet him up

361
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Adoption event

362
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
And

363
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
When my partner and I go to the event

364
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
We find Samson and

365
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
He is just as cute in person

366
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Except we noticed that he's

367
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Super super

368
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Scared

369
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Where he's like shaking and

370
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,327
He can't even stand on his own and the people at the adoption event at the house

371
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
The flap

372
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
So I don't know maybe that should have been a red flag for

373
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Who knows.

374
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
For me I was like I don't like

375
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Keep that going to come out

376
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
So I'm going to be the one to bring him out of his shell

377
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
And so

378
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
Samson was living with The Fosters

379
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Family and they wanted to do a home visit

380
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:07,647
So if I still came over with Samson to my apartment my little basement apartment in DC

381
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,743
And we gon this walk a little exploratory walk around the neighborhood

382
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,375
And while they're walking we passed by a man who is black and he's wearing a sweatshirt

383
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Scanza Foster turns to me and goes

384
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Oh

385
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
He doesn't like men in hoodies

386
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
So cat is thinking

387
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
And I'm thinking it was you sent me this

388
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,503
Are you saying that he's scared of guys in hoodies or are you saying that he's afraid of

389
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Black men

390
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Right

391
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
But

392
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
Samson was also afraid of me

393
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
And

394
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
Tell Philly badly wanted a dog and Samson seemed

395
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
You know just like

396
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Like he needed me

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
And I don't know maybe this is

398
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Patronizing

399
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Human

400
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
Adopt a dog think I don't know I don't know and so I decided my partner and I decided to adopt him

401
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
And

402
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
We loved him so much and we love him we love him

403
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Present tense

404
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
So

405
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,855
Cat her partner take sanzen-in and almost

406
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Immediately

407
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Cat would have a friend over who is black-market her friends who are brown

408
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,399
For a long time that he especially did not like what if I create an American friend when they would go outside

409
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
He just was afraid of anybody who was an American or you know like

410
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,407
Let them out but then it became this

411
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Clarify just one thing

412
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
You yourself are not white

413
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
I am I am Asian American and Chinese Americans you think that's maybe because you said he was afraid of you at first

414
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
Do you think that he maybe was afraid of you because you weren't like

415
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,583
I don't know he is so at he did like my partner more and my partner is white

416
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,191
In MCAT did put Santa in training in butt

417
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:01,823
That didn't seem to work so she was just left looking at this adorable little dog that she just taking in thinking

418
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
Is he racist

419
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
And I should be quick

420
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
This is like a question that a lot of people have

421
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
You know you know what's going on

422
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
This is not the first time I've heard like this morning my mom called me

423
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:24,096
This idea that dogs can be racist is racist

424
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
Chose all the time he's going to get really aggressive towards people with darker color skin

425
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
Huffington Post in Psychology today and actually what parks and

426
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
Jacksonville dog owners have you ever heard of this idea that a dog can like you're racist and they're a bunch of people who were like I have

427
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Oh yeah

428
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,464
Totally wants long time ago you know I heard stories about

429
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
Play somebody there like he doesn't like a white girl dogs that maybe didn't like white women you be bottom and just black women

430
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,008
Black men I guess all this is just a long ways that this is definitely you know

431
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
So my question is

432
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
Is it actually a thing now I'm rolling so this is going to be kind of

433
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
A fun conversation about race

434
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
Can I sat down with this woman sure

435
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,304
Sure I'm Alexandra Horowitz I

436
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,448
Study at the dog cognition lab and Barnard does research and dogs think about dogs. Dogs all things dogs

437
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Okay

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
So go to jump in Cattails Alexandra

439
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
That how she is taking Sampson in

440
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Barca seems to be

441
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Ina races

442
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,296
But like you know is that even possible I don't know can a dog be

443
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Recess

444
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
She was like

445
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Well

446
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Obviously

447
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
Dogs aren't racist

448
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
The way humans are racist

449
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,376
I mean racism is rooted in our history the history of our country and how we've dealt with different

450
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Groups of people

451
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
But dogs do not know about that

452
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
What the dog knows about comes

453
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
From

454
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Its own life

455
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
That dog's own life

456
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
But

457
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,968
Ancira talking through what dogs can do

458
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
We ended up having this conversation

459
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
About

460
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,624
The most basic elements of being a racist

461
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
Erase it erase it anything about it

462
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
You know step one is just

463
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,352
Putting people in these different groups in your head

464
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Can dogs

465
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Remember types of

466
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:40,544
People or just well I do think the dogs are sensitive to new things and differences

467
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
And one thing that Alexander told us that she's seen in her work is that dogs do seem to play differently with diff

468
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,040
Different breeds for instance they play better with ones that kind of look

469
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
Like them wait so dogs have a bye at the good they are purchased for there on time

470
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
They do and partly might be because they have the same kind of equipment the same length tail the same time

471
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Ear shape the same body size

472
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
So they understand each other's cues a little better might just be easier but that's what I'm saying is dogs notice difference

473
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Census in the world

474
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
And when it come to noticing differences between people

475
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
There's some at least anecdotal evidence that dogs can see can tell men and women apart

476
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
They can't see differences in skin color

477
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
Right cuz I are dogs colorblind solutely can see

478
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,976
Color differences

479
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
What is the world look like to a dog

480
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:38,144
Best approximation is that there's probably seeing something like the color spectrum when it's

481
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
Dusk and feels like yellow

482
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
Sense of worth in oranges

483
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Have disappeared or have been muted

484
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,200
Okay so the dog can see color yeah so it seems like it's possible that maybe dogs can tell the difference between skin

485
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,760
But then the next question is

486
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Can a dog

487
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Then

488
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,440
Make associations you know like light-skinned people like this and dark-skinned people are like this

489
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,792
And then carry that forward and all this other interactions whenever it meets another person

490
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Like that person

491
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Ingroup bias

492
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
And can it do that with dark-skinned people in question

493
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Well

494
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
That's okay I actually did this

495
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,896
Did us-34 code-switch okay

496
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
It's rainy and afraid of that she

497
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
She found 20 Mori

498
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
Laurie Santos she is another dog cognition expert except this time she's at Yale

499
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Call and I'm like

500
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Hi I think my dog is ready

501
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
And she comes to the same thing as Alexandra

502
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,936
I think the word racist has a lot and it you know the history of race in America and all these

503
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
But in her work

504
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
She has been trying to answer

505
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
This is very basic

506
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
Can a dog show preferences for certain racial groups the Lorry designed a study a dog

507
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Dog version of a very famous human study known as an IAT which is the implicit association test

508
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
I don't think I've ever heard of this test

509
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,048
I don't know what it is okay so the implicit association test that is put up my heart rate right so basically that test

510
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,704
You can take it online it kind of feels like a computer game where you get these words and have to sort whether they are positive

511
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Dave or negative

512
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,520
And then you're also getting faces

513
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
Like to speak to the people and you have to sort weather Bay AR

514
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
Black or white

515
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:29,760
Basically they're kind of test to see if you would like associate certain groups of people with certain kind of negative or positive

516
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Images of thought

517
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Tracks yes yes

518
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
How on Earth would you give this to a dog

519
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Well

520
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,952
I think our dog is here right now so we can

521
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
Lori found with implicit bias research similar kinds of Studies have been done with human babies

522
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,424
He's just to see if they have racial preferences and since their babies

523
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
They can't use computers with words

524
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
Researchers use photos photos of different human faces

525
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
So

526
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Adidas for dogs

527
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Lori had this Pit Bull mix named Vader come in and what she does is she

528
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Bring the dog into this little room

529
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
And they have a dog sit

530
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
I live near the center of the room where there is a reason

531
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
And she

532
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Hatha Spa

533
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
And it kind of reminds me of like a little Puppet Theater

534
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Where

535
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
It's open on one side

536
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
And you can slide in different images

537
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
At the front that the dog will see

538
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
So the research assistant gets his box ready

539
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Life in a picture

540
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
And then

541
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,720
Gold office cover to show Vader a picture of a black person

542
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Just a straight face

543
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Yeah kind of headshot

544
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
And then

545
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
They said the same picture to Vader over and over

546
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Over again

547
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
You seem straight face

548
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Black person

549
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
But then

550
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,528
The researcher shows Vader this picture of a

551
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Smiling

552
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Happy looking German Shepherd

553
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
And then

554
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Black person

555
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
Smiling German Shepherd

556
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
It's all very randomized

557
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
So sometimes it is

558
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,032
Black person black person then smiling dog

559
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,872
The boy

560
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,016
What is it that they're looking for here they only showed black faces and happy dogs

561
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
And you don't

562
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
When data comes it again the Lively show him other kinds of combinations

563
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
White faces angry dogs

564
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,512
Angry dogs and then if you know

565
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
So on

566
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,120
And what they're looking for and in this is the same thing they're looking for when they

567
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Did the test on babies

568
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,240
Is to see whether the dog is attentive and focused

569
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,568
Or bored and unfocused

570
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
Basically how is the dog reacting to

571
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
These two different pictures being put together

572
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
The way Lori but it was

573
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,808
You know if a dog shows like a pro white bias then

574
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,672
They should find the categories of white faces look happy dogs easier to process

575
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
And therefore more boring

576
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,768
So they might like Look Away more or

577
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,632
They might not be able to stay focused boredom implies that that dog might have a preference for white people

578
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,776
But then if they see a black face a happy dog and they stay really focused on it and they're not bored

579
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,384
That could possibly mean that maybe they're surprised that these two things go together

580
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
And maybe that's evidence of a little bit of prejudice

581
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
So so what is Lori learned

582
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
Will Dad here it is

583
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
The big news

584
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,208
And it's too soon to tell it's still too early to tell

585
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
Yeah I mean we're really at such an early stages it's really hard to say I guess one thing we have learned is that

586
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:03,008
Are so many people are interested in the results of the study your people really want to know the answer to the question of how dogs

587
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
CDC categories

588
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
And that's been really compelling just to realize

589
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
How fascinated people are with this question

590
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,528
How often do you get the is my dog racist question

591
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,136
Shure again Alexandra Horowitz you know because we see dogs as mirrors of ourselves

592
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Our dog

593
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Books as mirrors of ourselves

594
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
And

595
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
They are

596
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
Because regardless of what a dog

597
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
Can see or not see

598
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,680
Or whether they associate negative feelings with

599
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Different faces

600
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,032
The one thing that dogs are very very good at

601
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,872
And in this is something that both Lori and Alexandra made a plaintiff

602
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Is

603
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
Paying attention to us

604
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
And more specifically

605
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
How we behave

606
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,416
For instance remember this idea that thoughts and tell men and women apart well she was like

607
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
Probably has nothing to do with what men and women look like but instead it's how we behave men and women.

608
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Deal with dogs a little bit different

609
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
On the whole

610
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
You should bring treats

611
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:12,128
Women are more effusive

612
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
More likely to talk to dogs

613
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,064
In a higher pitch voice women might be more likely to crouch down

614
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,928
To a dog instead of kind of coming right up to a dog so these are obviously generalizations

615
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,744
I think a dog is very sensitive to

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,888
Does behavioral differences in Alexandria says the person who dogs are the most sensitive to

617
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,216
Who sponsored their King the closest amount of attention to

618
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Is you

619
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
You the guardian

620
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
You the owner

621
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
We have

622
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
To be sensitive

623
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
When we feel

624
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Tents

625
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
I wonder if

626
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
You know I suspected this thing

627
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Became dislike

628
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
Sort of funny but not really funny thing that I always wondered

629
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
And somehow convey

630
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
Confirmed it or made it happen to spy

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
You know

632
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Just the anxiety of

633
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Oh my gosh is my dog actually

634
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Is he racist

635
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
Well so if for instance and I don't want to

636
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
Put behaviors in your

637
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,408
I don't want to say you're doing something or not but if you tense up

638
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
When you see your dog's going to have a reaction

639
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
To somebody

640
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,624
And your Dogs Unleashed sure they're at some level in your control

641
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
Then the dog will feed off of that

642
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
Cat do you think that that's something you do do you think that your

643
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
That you have almost as pre reaction

644
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,680
To Samson's reaction that might sell Samson to react

645
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
Nothing no I don't know

646
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Could be a situation where

647
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
This has become such a running joke among

648
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Our friends you know

649
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
That are friends who

650
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
You know many of our friends are people of color they come over and they're already like all this

651
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
This finds like this stupid.

652
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
This dog

653
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
You going to bark at me he might bite

654
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
I don't want to touch him really yeah I do

655
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
And so maybe that like

656
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
Maybe a host of things reinforce to Sampson

657
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
I may be cancerous

658
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
But like there is a potential that

659
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
I have created this world

660
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
My dog

661
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
Now sees the construct of race through me

662
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
Just because I have taught them to him through my

663
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,944
Like that all nonverbal cues of

664
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
A lot

665
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Esta

666
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
If only we could talk to dogs

667
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Understand

668
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,208
If you had 5 minutes apart not going to make it harder if you had

669
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
2 1/2 minutes to talk to Sampson what am I

670
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
What questions would be so hard to do but

671
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,472
Like I would want to know about his history but that would obviously take up way too much time cuz I feel like

672
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
Being a southern boy he would have like a really hard time

673
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,128
So I think I would just spend those two and a half minutes being like

674
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
You are such a

675
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,272
Acute dog everybody in general regardless of race I don't even know if you can tell the difference between

676
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
People they would love you

677
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
And

678
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,952
He loves attention so much and you know like when he does get settled into a situation he can be such a

679
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
A cute and I like

680
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
Devour he always wants at some scratches

681
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
Sam said if you were this nice

682
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Every single person you met on the street

683
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,728
And you just didn't let fear dominate you

684
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
People would love you so much

685
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Watch

686
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
I know I wish I could give him that pep talk

687
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
I wish someone would give me that

688
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
Good boy okay

689
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,824
Good job

690
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Kaiser Tracy hunt thanks also to Cat Chow from NPR code switch you can find a live

691
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:08,672
Link to her original story at radiolab.org thanks also to Samson

692
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Tolerant dogs everywhere

693
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Natural waist

694
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
K9

695
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
Chandelure

696
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,592
Inattentively pooping in public

697
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
What a title

698
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Speaking with dogs

699
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Another beat

700
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Ruffle here Raphael Kroger

701
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
I read for Harper's magazine

702
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,368
Has had a long-standing question when it was answered

703
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
By a German scientist

704
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Highest gross

705
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
In that scientific paper he just

706
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
So

707
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
This began for

708
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
The author of the paper must

709
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
The same way that it began for me it was an idle curiosity

710
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Paucity

711
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
He was

712
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Raising

713
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
3 kids

714
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
He would take them to the park

715
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
Their children and families around

716
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
But there was also

717
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Assertive

718
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Crisis level

719
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Dog poop

720
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
He sees people letting their dogs

721
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Poop

722
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
And then

723
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Just walk away

724
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
And he starts to wonder

725
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
How can you

726
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Just leave.

727
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
How can you

728
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
Do something so

729
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,168
So specifically antisocial

730
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
As leaving

731
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Feces

732
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
On the sidewalk

733
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
What's with these people

734
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
What's what's going on in people's heads

735
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
And so

736
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
On the way to work in the morning

737
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
He would

738
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
Follow people at a certain distance

739
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
Without talking to them and take notes

740
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
You have to study there in front of you I have the sitting in front of me

741
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
And I quote

742
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
Neighbors watch

743
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Poop falling out of the dog

744
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
What it means

745
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
Poop in public huge pile of excrement on the ground and on the way back I'll go owners look away from their poop

746
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
In the afternoon he does

747
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
The same thing through the medium of poop

748
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
The earlier science

749
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
I had my God the fact that those previous studies

750
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Great

751
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,296
In the previous studies on this

752
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Russia size

753
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,648
The typical distinction is between people who pick up

754
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
The poop and

755
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
People who

756
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Just leave the

757
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Wet

758
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
Babe categorized as

759
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
Responsible and irresponsible

760
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Dog owners

761
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
But

762
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
After he's observed these people for a while

763
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
You start to recognize

764
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
But there was

765
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
Something more complicated

766
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Intriguing

767
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
And

768
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
Battle going on

769
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,296
The 101 of the behaviors he observes

770
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Is

771
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
People bagging the poop going to that trouble and then just leaving

772
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
Scooping the poop up

773
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Putting it into an envelope

774
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Plastic envelope

775
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
And then they

776
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Don't throw it away yes

777
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
People will bagging the Bandit

778
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
Sometimes right next to

779
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
Garbage cans that are not overflowing

780
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
And then

781
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
D'Amore

782
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Intriguing

783
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
Version he observes his people baguette

784
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
And then display it

785
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
Prominent Place sometimes hung on a fence

786
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Sometimes

787
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,832
Hanging in bushes are ship trees

788
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
Switches be actual vernacular term

789
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,512
Yeah actually my favorite mysterious example and got the paper points to

790
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
People

791
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Hanging the bags

792
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
Poop on construction fencing

793
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,704
With flashing lights on it so that at night

794
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
It creates a kind of disco

795
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
For the Pooh

796
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Nuts.com

797
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
She describes a

798
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
And

799
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:46,016
What the author reason to this is that it's a kind of Middle Ground

800
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Between

801
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
Responsible and irresponsible

802
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Action

803
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Maybe you bagged

804
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
The poop to begin with

805
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
It's because someone's watching you you want to be

806
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Seen as

807
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
A good citizen

808
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
But

809
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Then later

810
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
It switches

811
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
2

812
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
A

813
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Form of rebellion

814
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
Against the unnatural constraints

815
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Civilization

816
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,528
And so leaving the poop returns humans to Nature in a way

817
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Humans can no longer

818
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Run around

819
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Pooping freely in the wilderness

820
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
So

821
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
The dog

822
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
Becomes a kind of proxy

823
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Through which this

824
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Aggressive mischievous

825
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
Atavistic desire can be played out

826
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,568
So I want to drop my pants and just poop on the street but my dog does it

827
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Good for me

828
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
Something like that yes

829
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,664
Is that mean

830
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,760
When you see a man or woman with a dog who poops on the street

831
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
You should be getting those cheat just pooped

832
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Well

833
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
It's

834
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
At the very least

835
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
If you decide to get into it and

836
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Tell somebody pick up your poop

837
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,352
The U is ambiguous

838
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Weird

839
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
I'm honestly speechless by that

840
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Robert I did Nazi that coming

841
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
Well I will just walked in and an end

842
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
And left it there for us

843
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
And then it was picked up by

844
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Adler who

845
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
Back and put it

846
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
On display

847
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,912
As sometimes happens of course it's time introduced

848
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
And I guess

849
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
Time to take

850
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Yes but you got to take a break

851
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
We're back a few more questions

852
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
And answers coming up right after

853
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
This is Chelsea Gibson

863
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

864
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
And I'm here because I need your

865
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
And I request

866
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:52,640
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

867
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,711
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

868
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Brilliance

869
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Basically I want to hear about this

870
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
Times when a kid you know did something

871
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
It just means you lean back and say

872
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Well

873
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
How did they do that

874
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Maybe it was the moment that I

875
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

876
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
To you

877
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

878
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,727
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

879
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,055
Or maybe the kids in math class you notice their writing used

880
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
Taking the margin of their geometry

881
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,735
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

882
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
It doesn't have anything to do with it

883
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
If you have a story

884
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831

Chad Robert Radiolab Cavalcade of questions and answers and the next

892
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,623
Comes from producer Pat Walters hello Emily are you there

893
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
I'm here

894
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,951
Alright a few months ago I called this

895
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Tree sign

896
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,327
My test and Emily Burns and I'm the science director with save the Redwoods League

897
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
I have so many questions about trees for you

898
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
But I really just had one

899
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
So I I read this

900
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,079
A little tiny article in the spring I think

901
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Which artifact in it that really shocked me

902
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
Ian the fact

903
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Was

904
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,991
That redwood trees have

905
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
12 *

906
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
As much

907
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
DNA as humans

908
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Is that true well it looks like it is turning out to be at eight times bigger than the human genome

909
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,631
Okay. So 12 is closed a little overestimated name is not a reliable source

910
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,471
But the idea that like these trees would have so much more DNA than I

911
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Just kind of like

912
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
Twisted my brain up in 7 different ways

913
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
It's pretty crazy

914
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:04,735
Cuz you usually think of genes that means something to do with complexity exactly so if your Mozart

915
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,879
Oh you're a Tall Tree like who's going to have the most genes

916
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
Don't like what is all that extra DNA even doing well I'm not a geneticist

917
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
Forest conservation

918
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
One thing Emily was able to tell me

919
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,215
Is that I was missing the forest for the trees

920
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
So to speak and why is that

921
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,383
Well family told me that Chris Treadwell it does have a very large genome there are

922
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,455
Tons of things that have way more DNA than us

923
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Anime bowling

924
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
You just got a new.

925
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,599
Like a rundown

926
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
So

927
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
An onion has five times as much

928
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,583
An onion apus salamanders with 40 times as much

929
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,983
Let's hear things like lungfish has a cockroach red meat Lobster

930
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,383
I love to just lies in the bottom of a cold seeing bolt at the top of the list arguably the

931
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,687
Prison with the most DNA in the world

932
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,503
With 50 times more DNA than a human

933
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,343
Is a tiny not so remarkable looking

934
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
Little Japanese

935
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Flower that's deeply strange

936
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:22,559
It's puzzling by the way is biologist Ryan Gregory professor at the University of Guelph

937
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:28,959
In Canada and my area of study is why certain salamanders have 40 times more DNA

938
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Then you and I do

939
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,823
Am I told me like no one knows exactly why that's the case

940
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,175
Well that's why I still have a job is because this is something we're trying to figure out what

941
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
According to Ryan

942
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Here's what we do now

943
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,879
So in your genome and I I say yours and I mean that in a mine too I'm not going to single you out take the human genome

944
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
Your genome is about

945
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
1 1/2 to 2% jeans

946
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
Only about 1 to 2% of your DNA is involved in making the stuff that makes

947
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Up you

948
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
That's the stuff we called jeans

949
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:05,823
Now there's another couple percent that we now think are there to turn those jeans on and off switch

950
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,711
Is important but the vast majority of your DNA is accumulated

951
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
Detritus could be a gene that sort of mutates into grades and no longer works in might be random

952
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
Redundant copies of other DNA example of might be

953
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,815
80 80 80 80 a million times

954
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
Became essentially stock

955
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,263
In the genome and so now they're passed on from parent to offspring but the key thing is that all these little random bits of

956
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
DNA

957
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,615
Turn a hanging around there not really doing anything

958
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:44,479
Which princess is how you can end up with a huge genome even though you're just a

959
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,807
The tree or frog or a worm or even single cell

960
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:52,671
That's right but if they're not doing anything to help me why well

961
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
They would be doing things to help themselves

962
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Help them

963
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Sounds a bit like

964
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
You think about

965
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
The bacteria in your gut

966
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
Most of them are probably just

967
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,775
There because you're a nice warm bag of nutrients that is a great place to live if you're bacterium

968
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,127
That would be kind of the same sort of thing that might be happening in the genome which is

969
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
But they're not like

970
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
Alive

971
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,991
Really right like there

972
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Where are they

973
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,159
Well I don't I don't know I think it depends a lot on your definition of a live so I mean are viruses alive

974
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,975
That that's a philosophical question that

975
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Is pretty difficult

976
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
But the shift that you have to

977
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,095
Kind of make

978
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
And thinking about the genome is less that its it's

979
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:39,007
It's basically the recipe for making you or the blueprint for

980
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,079
A human or any of those kinds of things and think of it

981
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,407
Almost more like a little ecosystem

982
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,247
A jungle with all kinds of different entities

983
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
Doing their own thing

984
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
But

985
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
The one thing that they all do

986
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Is used us

987
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
To make copies of themselves

988
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
So

989
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
In this vast

990
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Ecosystem

991
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,607
In some part of your DNA you get some

992
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Ancient fire

993
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
It just keeps

994
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Happy

995
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Little further down the line

996
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Another one

997
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
Do the same thing

998
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
And then in some other part of your DNA 80 80 80 80 80 80 80

999
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,087
Just copying itself again and again and again and again

1000
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,183
Almost everywhere you look you have these dumb bits and TNA just

1001
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,999
Copying themselves over and over again

1002
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,143
Building up yourselves with useless DNA looks like a hitchhiker that gets into your car you turn around suddenly

1003
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
Is it a Fred there's now Fred and Fred

1004
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:46,591
Yeah and then turn around again this Fred and Fred and Fred right I mean Fred and Fred and Fred and Fred and

1005
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,943
That's pretty much how you end up with these super huge dinos

1006
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Sometimes

1007
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Back and bi Pride

1008
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Okay so

1009
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
Brian told me about this particular sound

1010
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
Certain group of salamanders

1011
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Caballito glycemia

1012
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Is part of the

1013
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,559
Very large family of salamanders that live all over the Western half of

1014
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,143
North America

1015
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,495
A long long time ago something happened in the environment that made the salamanders get

1016
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Littler

1017
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Define

1018
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
Except for this one problem they have big genomes

1019
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
And the more DNA there is

1020
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
The bigger the cell is

1021
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
Saumur DNA

1022
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Hagerstown

1023
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
Because

1024
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
All the DNA have to go in the nucleus

1025
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Of every single cell

1026
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,927
So as the salmon start getting smaller and smaller and smaller

1027
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
Their bodies are getting smaller

1028
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
And their heads are getting smaller

1029
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Because they have these huge dinos

1030
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
They tend to have

1031
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,119
Ignorance

1032
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
And now you're trying to cram a whole bunch of big neurons

1033
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Into a tiny little skull

1034
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,543
Well you're not going to fit as many and so

1035
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Relative

1036
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
Two other salamanders

1037
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
That haven't been man tries

1038
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,991
Their Vision starts to degrade slightly their ability to

1039
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,551
Look around in the world and distinguish like

1040
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
What's an insect and what's a leaf

1041
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:07,487
Gets worse Conte I can't do the kind of visual predation that you normally

1042
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
See you in there was a relative

1043
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Instead they

1044
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
Shifted to

1045
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
Being lie in wait predators

1046
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
Basically but having a huge genome

1047
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Maybe salamanders get dumb

1048
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,711
And I couldn't help but think about you know all the extra stuff you accumulate so.

1049
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
It's almost hard to get in

1050
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
And close the door behind

1051
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,391
I like my partner and I have the storage closet that's just

1052
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,743
With crap a watering can the broom and a car battery

1053
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Pile of button-down shirt

1054
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
I want a little bit too small ones

1055
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,935
It's kind of boring how old is very uncomfortable

1056
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:53,055
A lot of it I don't even know why we happening there's like a three and a half foot tall roll

1057
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,639
Brown paper several unfinished art project rubric

1058
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,967
. right now on top of that is a flower pot or air conditioner

1059
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Oh there's another backpack

1060
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,391
Remember when I was in my twenties and like everything I own fit in a couple of suitcases I was light

1061
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
Agile free

1062
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
What now

1063
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Tupperware

1064
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
Bucket

1065
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Full of paint

1066
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
Charcoal infused fabric

1067
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,655
I have so much of this stuff at least you don't have

1068
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
A closet in which

1069
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
Shoes replicate

1070
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:26,079
Themselves over and over again

1071
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,687
And you don't want to complain and feel very lucky to have all these possession but

1072
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
Sometimes it's a pile up starts to feel like

1073
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
A bird it doesn't that feels like a bird like I feel like I'm going down the sound and it wrote just getting bigger

1074
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Dumber

1075
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Slower

1076
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
Bigger and Dumber

1077
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
Slower

1078
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
There are definitely

1079
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
Surprises

1080
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,703
But then I talk to science writer Carl Zimmer and he made me feel a little bit better about all the extra

1081
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
Junk

1082
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
In my closet

1083
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
In myself

1084
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,079
Literally none of us would be here

1085
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,407
If not for that one gene

1086
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,735
Because he says there's one little bit of DNA that

1087
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,783
Climbed out of the junk closet

1088
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
And made all of us

1089
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
What what is it

1090
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,439
Well you've actually heard about it before

1091
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
Really special about mammals is that

1092
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Female mammal

1093
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
Placental mammal

1094
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
Carrie young around inside

1095
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,031
David quammen told us about it in a little while ago called infective heredity and it's basically this

1096
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
Gene that makes a protein

1097
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
Which helps makes himself

1098
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,943
Elsie's very special layers of cells in placenta

1099
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Cells that let it

1100
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Grab onto

1101
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,367
The mother's uterus and pull nutrients in to feed

1102
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
The embryo has nutrients

1103
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
In

1104
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,487
It protects the fetus from the mother's immune system

1105
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,327
Now when we talk to David about it and how did we get that good idea

1106
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
We got that good idea from a virus

1107
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,191
We should have a maze that this Gene had come from a virus

1108
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,847
But what I learned from Carla is that this little Jean sat in the junk closet of our DNA for millions of

1109
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Years

1110
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
Doing nothing making little copies of

1111
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
It's not

1112
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Keeping me at all

1113
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,855
Until suddenly millions of years later there's a mutation and that little useless

1114
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,903
Strip of DNA got repurpose

1115
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Co-opted it

1116
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
It took on a new job

1117
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
For us

1118
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
That's amazing

1119
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,143
And now we evolve a dependence on it so that we have to have

1120
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
BS

1121
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
About it

1122
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Big boxes

1123
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
A picture frame

1124
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,359
Guitar case

1125
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,455
That's the motto of this room is like

1126
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
You never know

1127
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Whatever the hell this is

1128
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
What is this

1129
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
The peace of God

1130
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Traffic

1131
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Where's the traffic

1132
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
Do we bring it back

1133
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Pennsylvania

1134
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
What's in that extra room

1135
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,999
I know this feeling I know this feeling completely what's that like rummaging around for this don't like to let things go because I thought

1136
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:30,399
I think that they will always bounce back it's not like I just left in placental Revival at some point

1137
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
The bike

1138
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,031
I have tight pants that I waiting for me to get skinnier

1139
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,871
Sitting in the corner of the street about

1140
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,967
Optimism better than the way you carry

1141
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:48,831
Is actually one day going to come back and make you light and Airy and beautiful

1142
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,159
That is a perfect Segway to our next question Robert that's

1143
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,559
Which is it which is itself a imbued with the spirit of optimism hope and Reconciliation and it's very dark

1144
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,679
Crowded and ugly place yes

1145
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Hi karta hai

1146
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
Hello cover

1147
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,799
Hi guys how are you calling us from

1148
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:14,175
But I'm in the studio at wunc in Chapel Hill

1149
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
The flick Broadway

1150
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:21,855
Yes in a territory which usually s choose it

1151
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
Oh in a what are you

1152
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,207
Talking about your fervent hatred

1153
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
Top American songs

1154
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,399
I thought we were talking about the subway noise

1155
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,959
This has nothing to do with me

1156
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
It has a little to do with Broadway

1157
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Carter what is it maybe you should

1158
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
Did this Begin by

1159
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
Framing the question

1160
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
The Deep mystery

1161
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
A short

1162
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,183
The Deep Mysteries around this sound that I've been here

1163
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
Hearing in the subway

1164
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,791
Since I was a younger person probably since I was in Middle

1165
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
School

1166
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,375
To sound that you hear when you're standing on the platform

1167
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
And the train is just about to leave the station

1168
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
And

1169
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
And you sure these three pure Hi-Tone

1170
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,951
Yeah that's annoying oh my God. That is the New York sound yeah it's a very New York

1171
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Sound

1172
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
And

1173
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,583
If you're a fan of musicals

1174
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
You can only hear that sound as one thing

1175
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,615
That's totally unmistakable as the opening notes to like the most

1176
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,663
Famous song in West Side Story

1177
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Somewhere

1178
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Pretty sure that it

1179
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Truck music

1180
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,855
First few times that I heard it

1181
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,463
Die die die.

1182
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,839
There's a place for us and we just as soon as I heard it

1183
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,519
In the course of reporting this story I talked to a bunch of different New Yorkers my name is Julie town I'm a

1184
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,919
Writer and director for all curious about this sound is it supposed to be West Side Story is that intentional

1185
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,223
Ways to look around the subway car and wonder

1186
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,319
You guys

1187
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:34,975
Did you notice that that sounded just like somewhere from West Side Story. I almost wanted to stand up and make

1188
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,071
I got a feeling

1189
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
That's Jamie Bernstein

1190
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:44,959
Her dad is Leonard Bernstein who wrote the music for West Side Story

1191
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
I've talked to my brother and sister about it a lot

1192
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,823
All kinds of

1193
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
No friends

1194
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
We just randomly

1195
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Email me

1196
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
You noticed

1197
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
Map of subway plays the opening notes

1198
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,551
YouTube somewhere like people were really not

1199
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
How to sing it around New York

1200
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Okay so

1201
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,927
The question is there's a sound in the subway

1202
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,975
Right

1203
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
There's a sound in the subway

1204
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
Where does it originate

1205
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
From and is there anything

1206
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,191
Interesting and beautiful about

1207
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
Why it exists

1208
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
That's my question

1209
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,079
And do you have any I guess what makes that sound

1210
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
Is it the train that is singing this to me or is it the steel rails under the train that's what I thought it was

1211
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,575
I thought maybe it was it was you listening

1212
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Actually

1213
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
I thought it was a train coming

1214
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Rounding the

1215
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
The corner as its

1216
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
Coming in

1217
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
To the platform

1218
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,375
It's scraping its side against the incoming think

1219
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
And that's creating a

1220
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
Squeal

1221
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,471
It just so happened to always hit that pitch

1222
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
No

1223
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
But that's not it

1224
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,407
This isn't

1225
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Did you solve the mystery

1226
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
Well

1227
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295
Just going to have to listen and find out

1228
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,063
Okay

1229
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,879
So sarkari the blizzard been helping me

1230
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,951
Make a call to the MTA

1231
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,511
And they told us

1232
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,863
That we were supposed to hop on a train a train and go way uptown

1233
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
To this warehouse this big train Warehouse

1234
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,727
We were just told to find a guy named Sheldon

1235
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
Hello

1236
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,847
Car hits

1237
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:33,247
Show me this engineer who works for the MTA he's been there like 13 years

1238
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,319
And who's really excited

1239
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,415
It took us into this massive

1240
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,023
Train repair room oh my goodness

1241
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
And there were

1242
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
All of these

1243
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,167
Subway cars up on the lift

1244
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,567
Wow and they just kind of look like these like empty shells of train cars

1245
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,383
We're walking into the electronic component shop

1246
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,479
And then Sheldon pulled us into this room off to the side through these sort of

1247
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,623
Heavy doors electric electric control

1248
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,695
Houston by here so are you bringing us here because

1249
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
Part of what

1250
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,279
We're interested in has to do with an electric component

1251
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,631
He took us over to a corner

1252
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,935
The sun is generated by Beach

1253
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727

What is the sing this is the part of the train

1261
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:48,511
Honestly was a little hard to know because he just launched right into like engineering language

1262
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Back to the Future

1263
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
But yes

1264
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
It's part of the train

1265
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
It's a little box

1266
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
That sits next to the motor

1267
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
And from here on out

1268
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727

01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,695
To explain to you why it has the sound

1277
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Sheldon Cana Punta

1278
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
I'm so

1279
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
We had to reach out to someone for some help

1280
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
Oh yeah I could tell you

1281
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,423
Absolutely sorry and I called up

1282
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Jeff hackner

1283
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,727
Patrick professorville

1284
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,031
Electrical Computer Engineering at Cooper Union

1285
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,359
Where I fought for 25 years

1286
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
Who works at the end

1287
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,967
NTA and they referred to as a legend in

1288
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
Transit Circle

1289
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,343
I'm not sure I'm not sure who said that and

1290
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
How much they had to drink when they said that but

1291
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
But

1292
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
I've been involved for many years

1293
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
And Jeff broke down the

1294
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,815
The singing box for us like this

1295
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,911
You started by telling us how the Box even got into the trance to begin with

1296
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
Stand clear of the closing doors

1297
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:07,871
So what happened is about the year 2000

1298
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:12,223
Thousand around the time America was obsessed with

1299
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,271
Computer bugs go bald

1300
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,343
Stolen elections

1301
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Decided

1302
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,183
They needed to radically redesign the cars

1303
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,743
Bente was like we need a massive upgrade

1304
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:28,351
So they brought in all of these new train cars or 142s

1305
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,423
Call them the new tech train new technology train

1306
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,471
It was going to be a whole new era

1307
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,031
These trains were going to be more energy efficient

1308
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
But

1309
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
One big problem

1310
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
The newer train

1311
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,199
Those require alternating current

1312
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,759
The system is a direct current system

1313
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
The third rail is direct current

1314
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
In other words

1315
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,135
There's a power mismatch

1316
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
The new trains run on

1317
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
AC power

1318
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,023
The subway system could only provide

1319
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
DC power

1320
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
Wait they brought in trains

1321
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
It ran on the wrong kind of power

1322
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Yes

1323
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
When was AC when was DC

1324
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
What exactly is the difference between AC and DC again

1325
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
It's all based on the flow of invisible electricity when you have BC

1326
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,647
Power of the fluids long smooth but steady like a straight line with a C

1327
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Play pulsing kind of

1328
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
Find weight of a sinusoidal wave

1329
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,399
The same shape that governs

1330
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
The tides

1331
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
The phase of the moon

1332
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
The angle of the Sun

1333
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
Someone is smooth and what is Anjali

1334
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Exact

1335
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
Play an AC and DC don't play well together definitely not

1336
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,687
And they knew this when they introduce the new cars

1337
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,711
Yeah they knew

1338
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,991
The tracks have been

1339
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:49,759
Providing.

1340
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,783
DC power for like

1341
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,087
96 years so they weren't going to remake the

1342
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,879
The tracks cuz then you'd have to shut down

1343
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
The whole Subway for years

1344
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
But they needed to use

1345
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,023
AC for these new cars because there was so much more energy

1346
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
Efficient and so

1347
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
It was a disconnect

1348
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
The sharks in the

1349
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,775
The Jets anyways MTA had to figure out a way to take this kind of electricity

1350
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
And turn it into this

1351
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,919
Not interested

1352
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:24,319
The song is General where the singing box comes in threes module 8 strange DC

1353
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
To a safe place

1354
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,391
The box of Sheldon showed us

1355
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,719
That's what translates the electricity from one kinds the other

1356
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,047
And basically what these boxes do

1357
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
Is that when the train is cruising along

1358
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
Drawing and DC power from the third rail

1359
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:45,823
Power goes into that little box in the engine and inside that box

1360
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,943
Are these little transistors as switches

1361
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
Like like light switches

1362
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:58,879
The switches go on and off on and off on and off really fast and in the process take that DC current

1363
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,951
And I guess you could say like chop it up

1364
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
Where does the sound come in

1365
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,071
Okay so this is the part

1366
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
That I don't

1367
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Fully

1368
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
In my soul understand

1369
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,471
But it's Jeff explained it to us

1370
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,543
Flow of current in and out of these devices

1371
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,103
Creates mechanical stresses within them

1372
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,407
When you feed electricity into the box

1373
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,199
The transistors on the inside of the box

1374
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
Any inductors in the various things

1375
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
It gets sort of Jaws

1376
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
And when they do but act like little loudspeakers

1377
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,695
They're not designed as loud speakers

1378
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:39,327
But any of these devices when you flow alternating current flow through them will have

1379
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
Some tone

1380
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Admitted

1381
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:47,263
And it's the current interacting with these like physical parts

1382
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
Yeah that's what's making the sound

1383
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,407
Okay then a bunch of very complicated stuff happy

1384
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
But all you really need to know is that

1385
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
When you run current through the box

1386
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,087
The stuff on the inside of the Box gets stress

1387
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,367
Vibrate

1388
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
I guess

1389
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
And that creates

1390
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,463
High-pitched whining sound

1391
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
The changes

1392
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
Pitch depending on

1393
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
And that's

1394
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,351
Kind of the key to the melody

1395
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,679
The transistors chop up the electricity at different rates

1396
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Depending on how fast the train is

1397
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
It's going

1398
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
And the train has

1399
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
3 gears

1400
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,335
Well you can think of them like gears

1401
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
Gear one is when

1402
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
It starts out

1403
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,711
Twin sisters are doing their thing and this is the sound that comes out

1404
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:34,367
I meant the train shift to a higher gear as it accelerates and then this is the sound that comes out

1405
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:39,743
And then is a train settles into a Groove the transistors slow and then this is

1406
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
Sound that comes out

1407
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
Which gives you that Melody

1408
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,335
And now we get to the real Quest

1409
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
Sandwiches

1410
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
Is that a fluke

1411
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,479
Or could that Melody be intention

1412
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
So

1413
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
So

1414
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
We asked Sheldon from the MTA

1415
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,623
Do you think that those

1416
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,159
Notes are like

1417
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Just

1418
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,535
Coincidence like that's just the sound that it makes or like could they have been select

1419
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
No it's not

1420
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
It's not on purpose to keep

1421
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
To like to hear that song

1422
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,239
It's not to let us hear West Side Story in the subway

1423
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,335
But then we talked to Jeff hackner

1424
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
He told us

1425
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,687
The when you're designing a system like

1426
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,735
That singing box with the three gears

1427
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Each gear

1428
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,551
Does have its own settings

1429
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
Frequency of electricity

1430
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
And if you're the engineer you're setting that

1431
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
For each of the three gears

1432
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
And

1433
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,255
You're picking a frequency

1434
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
That

1435
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Is

1436
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Knocking overheat the equipment

1437
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
And at the same time is

1438
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Is fast enough

1439
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,239
That it's going to average out to this nice smooth sine wave

1440
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,543
I think it's interesting that you use the word

1441
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Kik

1442
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
What does a part of your kids

1443
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,639
Conspiracy Theory

1444
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,711
That that that somebody design these

1445
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
3 notes

1446
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,295
Guess what

1447
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,575
What I want to know is

1448
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
Whether or not

1449
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
Possible to

1450
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
To have that kind

1451
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Control

1452
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Choose the frequency

1453
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Yes

1454
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,535
Engineer codes

1455
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,863
Say I could pick a frequency between 1500

1456
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
3000

1457
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
I'm going to

1458
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
I'm going to

1459
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,031
Pick a DA in the 6th octave because I think that's funny

1460
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,663
What so that is totally possible or because you have a little bit of wiggle room within the design

1461
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,455
Interested

1462
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
So he sang

1463
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Possible

1464
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
But the engineer who designed the singing box

1465
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
Set the gears at

1466
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,367
At just the right frequency

1467
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
He's to make just the right size

1468
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
So what you saying

1469
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Yes

1470
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,999
Did you find

1471
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,071
The person who made the design choice

1472
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,399
Well you know we made a lot of calls

1473
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423
But

1474
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,263
Yeah we totally didn't Carter can you hear this high

1475
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,055
Yes hello can you hear me

1476
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,383
Yeah of course sorry my minutes to track down this

1477
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,455
My name is Matthew Vanessa Tavares

1478
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
French name

1479
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,831
We found him in Montreal my friends call me Madison my enemies call me mats

1480
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:18,463
Just go from Matt and he works for this Canadian manufacturer

1481
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,303
Which is the original equipment manufacturer for the so-called

1482
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,607
R142

1483
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,911
These days he's the head of Vehicle Arkansas

1484
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,495
Actor for all the different kinds of subway trains that Bombardier make

1485
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,311
What so he is the guy one of the guys

1486
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,871
Yeah back in about 2000 time

1487
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:41,247
I was young and cocky design engineer

1488
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
And for propulsion and breaking

1489
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:48,415
Matt told us he was part of the team that designs that are 142 and all the stuff that goes in

1490
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:54,815
Since I got all the equipment setup including the motors

1491
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
Single aspect of the design

1492
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
Including the singing box

1493
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,471
And when we asked him about the sound

1494
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,543
This is a very distinct sound that everybody talks

1495
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
Yeah I'm not only that he's a Musician musician way before I was an engineer

1496
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,831
Enough in a couple of hours I'm going to have to leave you if you're not bored to death by your story

1497
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:21,439
To practice with with a band were giving a concert in a couple of days in Montreal

1498
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:26,303
What's your van then what are you play actually replace very

1499
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Quirky

1500
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
Bizarre funny

1501
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,447
French song that you would not understand but

1502
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
Dirt bike funny

1503
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,919
Home visits

1504
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,943
His band

1505
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
Playing ACDC

1506
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
In French

1507
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
AC DC

1508
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,599
Very appropriate and some of the other stuff is

1509
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,391
Very musical theater e

1510
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:56,511
Which made us think what is this West Side Story stuff was intentional

1511
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,375
Do you have this musician turned engineer slipping in a little Easter egg

1512
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,655
A little gift

1513
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
All the New Yorkers

1514
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,519
The ride the subway every single day

1515
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,431
And in fact Matthew told us that after the Subways were unveiled

1516
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
People began to notice

1517
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Sound

1518
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Even wrote a white page

1519
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
Paper

1520
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,831
Where he came clean

1521
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,391
And here's a spoiler out of

1522
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
The punch

1523
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,975
Of this white paper was

1524
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
Choice of notes is a

1525
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,327
Pure coincidence

1526
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:36,447
I know II Des is this is this is a this is really

1527
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Spoiling your shirt

1528
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
I'm totally sure

1529
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,615
So they did choose the notes

1530
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
But not for any musical reason

1531
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,199
Write in fact

1532
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
Just a sort of

1533
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,503
Twist the knife a little bit

1534
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,807
She told us the first time I watch

1535
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,135
West Side Story was probably

1536
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,231
A couple of days ago and found it way too cheesy for me

1537
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:04,351
Yeah what about is it possible some of the other engineers in the room had

1538
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,655
You don't know one in that room recognized

1539
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,935
Those intervals

1540
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
I can

1541
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
Sure you

1542
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,543
That I'm on my deathbed

1543
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,591
I will continue saying that

1544
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
No one

1545
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,687
At the time really cared or reading you

1546
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,295
But even though my fantasy wasn't

1547
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Real

1548
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,879
I think what is what is real is the way it is received

1549
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
Gina Anselmo

1550
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,183
It's their weather by

1551
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
Buy incident or

1552
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
On purpose boat

1553
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,559
The way it's received as by all these people who

1554
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
Are either

1555
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,399
Unconsciously or consciously hearing this like

1556
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,983
More pleasant melody in the horrible you know

1557
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,519
Reaching for the subway

1558
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Truth is like

1559
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,103
Lovely reminiscent Melody that

1560
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,407
That's so many of us are familiar with

1561
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
And it's

1562
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
This

1563
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,271
Romantic Anthem to reconciling difference

1564
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,855
Wait remind me what is the story that they sing in that song Somewhere

1565
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
When at the end of the play

1566
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Tony and Maria

1567
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,487
Across the Great values of

1568
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
Culture index

1569
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,303
A love so Supreme

1570
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Stay With Me

1571
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,143
What's your name

1572
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
Whatever you want

1573
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,471
Just when Tony and Maria

1574
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
Are finally

1575
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,519
Together in Maria's

1576
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
Does bedroom

1577
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
Does Jamie Bernstein again and

1578
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Is everything around us

1579
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Always terrible

1580
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,711
Cool stuff is just happened they had the rumble and

1581
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
They're dealing with all the

1582
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Joshua tragedy

1583
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,111
I'm trying to

1584
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
To rise above it

1585
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
And so they sing this song

1586
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,071
Play

1587
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,935
And they imagine this place that doesn't yet

1588
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Exist for them

1589
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
They imagined

1590
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
The song

1591
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,871
That that doesn't fact raise them all above the horror in the

1592
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,479
Tragedy in the violence

1593
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Right it's it's it's

1594
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,087
The characters are all about

1595
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
Reconciling difference in finding this like

1596
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,439
Geographical space

1597
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
It's for like accepting

1598
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,047
It's an in finding loving and I don't know it's it's a very

1599
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,655
Romantic anthem for these like horrible Subways and such a lovely City

1600
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Address to

1601
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Meaning of that metal

1602
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,263
For the subway platform is this like democratizing space

1603
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Is everybody right there

1604
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
That is the place for all of us

1605
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
You know nnn

1606
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,175
You know just not to belabor the point

1607
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
But

1608
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
To belabor the point

1609
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
There's also

1610
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
This third level

1611
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,855
Hope you know that the generation of the noisettes

1612
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,159
Self it's sort of poetic

1613
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
The noise itself is

1614
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Created

1615
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Buy something

1616
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,023
I think that is reconciling

1617
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
Old system of wave into a new motor

1618
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
To be efficient

1619
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,959
And something in that in that translation process is creating me

1620
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,519
It's like a little West Side Story of electricity

1621
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:17,631
Now a truce

1622
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,495
Storyville true story a couple of years after we were using the same technology

1623
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,799
Are Ford the Long Island Railroad

1624
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
The M7

1625
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
From Long Island

1626
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,967
The attraction packages made by Mitsubishi Electronics

1627
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:38,623
And that the guys from Melco Mitsubishi Electronics Corporation I'd figured out that this thing could sing

1628
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:44,255
And the demonstration they always do with their inverter is that the they make it sing

1629
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:48,863
The odd to the Joy you know what man

1630
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399
Wow

1631
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,831
Alright well thank you so much the car Hodge and two sarkari for helping Carter producing reports at store

1632
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:47,231
And Temecula for putting the whole thing together and to the folks at NPR's code

1633
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:52,607
That's what you let us work with cash offer story about Samson and Andre Berman and Amy Brown

1634
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
Yes you say it to them before I say to them

1635
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
Okay cuz I have the advantage of

1636
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:05,407
I will remember the email address what you will never do

1637
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:09,759
Let's see where this let me do the first part everybody listening to this show

1638
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:15,135
Cuz probably at some point but I have a question to something has entered my head

1639
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,975
And I can't get it out cuz I don't know the answer when I want to know the answer

1640
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
Anime we've been embarrassed to ask
