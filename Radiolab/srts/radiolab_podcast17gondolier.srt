1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Hey I'm Jad abumrad I'm Robert Radiolab today we have the story of just how hard it can be to be who you are

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
Actually are

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,720
But it seems like the entire world is doing its best to make you who you actually

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,304
Aren't I guess I could admit this could be too many details but

7
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
Story starts for us

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
With reporter David Conrad

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,496
So for me it was back in late 2014

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
I was living in Philadelphia as a grad student

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
It's time David was

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
Applying for jobs

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,504
And one of the jobs he's applying for was at a radio show that was doing the series about International women's issues

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,576
And so I had this on my mind and I was taking a bus

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,184
Southern University and I just overheard somebody talking about their recent trip to Venice

16
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Of course

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,120
The classic tourist thing to do when you go to Venice is to take a ride on the canal boats the gondolas

18
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,960
And go down the canal maybe someone sends you a famous song

19
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Very romantic

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
In case

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
Person sitting on the bus next to David was telling their friend

22
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
That they had

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
Taking a gondola ride with this

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
First ever woman Gondolier Venice

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,184
Yeah it really cooking around me realize like how how does it become a we

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,328
How are you I'm Kristen Kristen Clark also a journalist radio producer

27
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
And she and David are partners and collaborator

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
I mean this is it was interesting is like

29
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
We realize how big a deal it is to be female Gondolier is like

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,408
900 year old tradition and it's always

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Father son father son father son or like uncle nephew down the line

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,416
Now nobody's there no ladies Evernote 900 years

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Think about that for a sec

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
Almost a thousand years of all men men men men men men and then one day

35
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
You get a woman write as a headline

36
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Woman breaks

37
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,472
To 900 year old glass ceiling I thought that sounds like a good pet

38
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,872
It sounds like God kissed you on the lips exactly it sounded it sounded like the perfect

39
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Empowerment story I guess it's all over

40
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,624
What from the Guardians of the New York Times to the financial times to the Cedar Rapids Gazette

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,256
Time music made it all the way to Cedar Rapids newspapers in Germany and in China and Australia

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,352
They all all the Articles laid out the same basic story

43
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
It was this Algerian woman from Germany

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Name Alexei

45
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,336
Tulip in Venice 20 years ago got around a gondoliers Association that never wanted to see a woman become a Gondolier

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
And eventually became the first ever female Gondolier Venice

47
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
The whole thing of course parking this giant gender War

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
But

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
That was sort of it

50
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,136
Pretty much the headline in the picture was the story

51
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,464
Many of the Articles didn't actually have all that many quotes from Alex

52
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
And so for me it sounded like a great

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Simple opportunity to go back and tell a deeper story

54
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Hell-bent on getting into this club

55
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,824
Just so clearly does not want them to

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
We evil Alex just

57
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,968
We're we're interested in your story were wondering if you might be willing to spend a few days with us this summer

58
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,320
And I was hoping it would just be like yes I'm happy to meet with you for a couple hours

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
And that would have been great but

60
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
We got an email back right away that said

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
If you come do the story you have to spend a week with me a week and then there are these questions about like who

62
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
We were as journalist what our purpose was and

63
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
A bunch of Demands you have to stay in the city you can't stay in like one of the suburbs and margary even though it's cheaper that you have to be in

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
In the city jerseys found at this time at a vision for things

65
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
I mean the message was definitely I want to tell a different story

66
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Did you have any idea what that meant

67
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
No idea

68
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
But we had that

69
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Echo I had that come into my head

70
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
So we flew to the Venice Airport. Took a bus to city center

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Stepped off the bus

72
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
And you can smell the salt in the air from

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
Come from the Grand Canal and it was

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Kind of rain a little bit was around midnight

75
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
We're kind of you know getting our bearings grabbing our bags and we

76
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
We look up

77
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Across the parking lot

78
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
There's Alex

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Standing under a Lamppost just leaning against it with a cigarette

80
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Smoke

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
Kind of curling up into the light of the streetlamp

82
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Short hair dark

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
It was slick back

84
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Do you think you were in a Fellini movie

85
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Honestly I didn't know what to think

86
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
This person

87
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Was legit under a lamp

88
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Smoking

89
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Absolute Alex

90
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
Taller than I expected

91
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
The strong build

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
Afisa was a little weathered like someone who works outside all day on the water

93
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Quite late so when you called I just finished school

94
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
How was your flight

95
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
Moscow first

96
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
And since it was late

97
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
We made a plan with Alex to meet up at 5:45 p.m. the next day

98
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
On the steps of Latin DJ Opera House

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:47,391
Okay beautiful Opera House

100
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
I loved all the mess in the

101
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,375
So anyway the the plan was to go out on a gondola ride which was one of Alex's demands in the first email

102
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
So we walk around the corner to where there gondolas Park

103
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Hand

104
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Taobao is like Shining

105
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
So the gauntlet was made for three people

106
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Narrow jet black

107
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
750

108
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Allison had about 12 years

109
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,167
What's up already quite a bit when I got it had a name

110
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
Can you choose it

111
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
All right

112
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Sup

113
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
She wants to come in

114
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Roku stick

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
So we climb into the boat

116
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Perfect

117
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
And Alex stands at the back

118
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
Holding you are and

119
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
We're down sitting in the in the lower seats kind of just like pointing the microphone up

120
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
If I take photographs every once in awhile

121
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
He came here to study it first

122
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
It's not what I said

123
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
And

124
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
It was pretty much immediately cleared

125
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
I mean

126
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
But it was not going to be an easy interview

127
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,487
You came here when you said I know I know that was wondering right right

128
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,351
Yeah we had a notebook full of questions and things that we had pulled from all these articles and read

129
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
That pretty quickly became useless

130
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
Whenever I asked about being the first female Gondolier and they're the first woman in 900

131
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
4 years to do this

132
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Star

133
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Such an over and over

134
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
Nova Nova

135
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Why won't you repeat things already

136
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Done

137
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
This is very frequent journalism problem you become boring to the person you're interviewing you just start flailing

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
1

139
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
What are you do

140
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
You know we just thought maybe we should just be

141
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Quiet probably

142
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
We are about to

143
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,679
We moved away from the tourist centers of the city and into the smaller canals

144
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
As we go around these tight turns

145
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
Alex would sing out for the other boats know that we were coming

146
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
So here are the Crossway this is why I shut off my direction

147
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
In order to

148
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Avoid accidents because

149
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Is it going to be is it going to arrive

150
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
You know we going to these beautiful archways

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Pakenham Gardens

152
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
Necessarily need ice in order to

153
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Appreciate

154
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Econo Lodge

155
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Every channel has a different song

156
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
Singing

157
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Flying face

158
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Song

159
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Is a beautiful entry

160
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Pittsfield

161
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
At one point a gondola cut through this rectangle of light

162
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Shining from an open kitchen door

163
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
It was nice I mean the side of Venice was

164
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Unexpected and really beautiful but

165
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
The whole time we were sitting on their notepads in

166
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
We're definitely quietly panicking

167
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
Well you know

168
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
Didn't know this at the time but you know I was like maybe you're a little too young and I think

169
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Alex

170
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Testing us

171
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
It may be a little bit too

172
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
You don't have enough experience Maybe

173
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
That was my concern but I like the

174
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
I like the enthusiasm

175
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
And I like the

176
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
There was an honesty which I like

177
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Did you ever figure out what you were being

178
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,119
Sussed out for what was going on there for sure not on the boat

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,215
But we we actually made plans to go out to dinner that night

180
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
Considering how the boat ride we thought at this point we should return to square one

181
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
And leave the record at home

182
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
Alright then just trying to have a conversation anyway we sit down outside and very few people are in the restaurant where were the only tape

183
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
People outside they had to open when we got there too we should say we met Alex's girlfriend right now we're making

184
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
How to making small talk

185
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
And

186
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Yeah it turns out

187
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Turns out Alex's girlfriend is over

188
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
Photographer and she done this photo essay about

189
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
And the photos are really striking

190
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
Like one of them Alex is just like drowning under the water there's one that's just like Alex's back is to

191
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
Set the camera at this trip to muscular back like looking out the window over the city of Venice

192
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
Venice's loan Defender

193
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Kind of like superhero style

194
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
So where is Alex girlfriend

195
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Can you tell me a little bit more about what inspired you to take these photos and you know like small talk friendly stuff and

196
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
She kind of looks like

197
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
You know it's just it's so strange

198
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
You know we thought

199
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
We thought it was so clear

200
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,759
Wait like the photos were so like they emphasized every masculine quality on Alex's body

201
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
We

202
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,671
You know an artist statement you know we used all of the mail forms in Italian

203
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Little Lake Louise which means

204
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
He instead of Les which means she but everybody at the photo exhibit was like oh must have been a typo or you made a mess

205
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,495
Mistake and she's like which is funny because I'm Italian so I should know and I was like

206
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
Pro pronouns

207
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Louis

208
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Key Alex

209
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
She used he

210
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Key Alex is a key

211
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Is Alex Translate

212
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Oh my gosh Alex is a transgender man

213
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Wow

214
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
What did you

215
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
That means you in that moment

216
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
What I thought that meant

217
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Was

218
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Alex was

219
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Probably born in the body

220
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,239
That he didn't identify with

221
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Mine was

222
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Hey I didn't think transgender I didn't think

223
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Alex is the guy of course

224
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Alex at the guy I wasn't I wasn't that surprised

225
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
I would say that like flipping into heat not a thing

226
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Like like it was like Alex is

227
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Alex is a he

228
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Alex is he

229
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
He is sitting at the table with us

230
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Alex and his girlfriend

231
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Very quickly it was like him

232
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
I'm looking at him

233
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,239
And then I start thinking about the story that we had come here to tell

234
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
That was about all of the women things that she had done her her her her woman here

235
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,759
Hero heroine first female in 900 years International symbol of female power

236
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
You start thinking about that and then it's like

237
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Those things are really hard to square in your head

238
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
This real person

239
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Is

240
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,351
Also the stories and how did that happen

241
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,215
What is it been like for 20 years to be inside of that story

242
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
When you're actually a man

243
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
After who knows

244
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,831
How many articles have been written about Alex this the first time that he is

245
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Publicly telling his story

246
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
As a man and so we should probably just stop for a second

247
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
And talk about pronouns

248
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
Because this is really important for many transgender people

249
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
In moments when Alex

250
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
Publicly understood as a woman and was getting

251
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Price for it

252
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
We've decided without permission

253
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,591
To only use his name or his title of first female Gondolier

254
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
While some of the people interviewed for the story were unaware that Alex is transgender and do use female pronouns

255
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
Or do you refer to him as a woman we

256
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
When were talking about him we

257
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Will only use male pronoun

258
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
So after that dinner we made plans for the next day

259
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,751
On his motorboat he would just take us to a quiet spot and we would

260
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
What's the agreement on the water on the water

261
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Shut up

262
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Stop it Basta

263
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Okay

264
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
A lot of false starts

265
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
Guadalupe baby I can

266
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Ask

267
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
As if it has anyone ever asked

268
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
What

269
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Pronoun you prefer

270
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
No never

271
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Never have

272
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Ever

273
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
So after getting some of the basics out of the way

274
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
Alex kind of started at the beginning

275
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Well you know

276
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
It's a long story

277
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
I was born twist in De

278
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,855
Zoos in Germany Alex tells us he was born with a female body

279
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,951
But at a pretty early age knew himself to be a little boy

280
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
I knew you were ready before I went to school

281
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
Whiskey yes I was standing on the toilet to pee inside

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
Alex is it you know for him even when he was three that there should just be something on his body

283
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
That wasn't there I was praying for a penis every night

284
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:22,271
My my parents knew about it his parents were actually both doctors

285
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
But they

286
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
They will not

287
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Supportive

288
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
You know I heard them you know they were talking about

289
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
All the weird

290
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Stuff I did

291
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
How you rip your arms off of his Barbies

292
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
Cutting them like in always black

293
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Pennsylvania

294
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
Trying them

295
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
By the way Alex dressed himself

296
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Little pencil

297
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
Bay suit for for boys

298
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
And you know what's up

299
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Of course very aggressive

300
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
As a child

301
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
Lot of fights

302
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
I was quite the Wyland

303
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
As I catch

304
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
So now I can up about this but you know

305
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
If it was a drama at home

306
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
It was a drama

307
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
The constant

308
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
Try of my

309
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Mother

310
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
2

311
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Get this

312
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Behavior out of me

313
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Alex's pretty early on

314
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Apparel

315
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
Basically gave up on him

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,967
Ignore me as much as a good time which was

317
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Saving me because I

318
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Could wear whatever I wanted

319
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Do whatever I wanted

320
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
A little brother was born in

321
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
That was a shock

322
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
That was a terrible shock because

323
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
Basically it confirmed

324
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
That my mother wanted

325
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Desperately

326
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
A boy

327
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
But she didn't accept me as her son

328
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
That's what it was

329
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
Alex said basically you know that was the first time he saw what like

330
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,671
It should look like basically when a parent loves their kid

331
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
So when he was 15 he ran away from home

332
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
Pembroke and the number if you have a huge

333
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,455
District Court employee where they have all the prostitutes

334
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
All the bad things and that's exactly

335
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
Well I win some people kind of took him under their wing got a job kind of figured out how to take care of himself

336
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
I got lucky

337
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
But I know also very unlucky

338
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Gay stories

339
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
But I got lucky

340
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Did he ever think about

341
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Transitioning to

342
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Male body

343
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
He says he thought about it at one point but

344
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,567
In the 80s when I was 15

345
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431
The opportunities you have had to become a man were very very

346
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:04,575
In particular if you wanted to go down the road of surgery I can remember for my family was

347
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,927
Constantly talks about how operations went wrong

348
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,999
How they went wrong and what went wrong answer

349
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
For me to go to the hospital to do an operation

350
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
And of course many transgender people don't end up having surgery

351
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
But anyway after homburg

352
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
At some point Alex fell into filmmaking and ended up in San Francisco working in in the filament

353
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
History and so 1996

354
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,087
He got involved in a production that sent him abroad to go scope out locations for a film that was going to be shot in Venice

355
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
The shows up in Venice in 1896

356
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
He's not a kid at this point originally he's just supposed to say a few days

357
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,031
Kind of just enough time to do some research and scope things out but somewhere along the way

358
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,871
He sees these guys rolling their boats down the canal and

359
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Reasons Heat

360
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
Can't entirely explained

361
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
He's just

362
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
Transfixed by this kind of

363
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,511
Bored and I was fascinated by The Rolling star

364
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
That you will forward to you

365
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Actually see where you going

366
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,983
So was just fascinated and I just wanted to try it out myself

367
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Eventually

368
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Alexandra Bachelor meeting a Gondolier

369
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
And asks like

370
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Do you think I could do this and

371
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Actually ended up down at the gondola station isn't a princess

372
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,623
Did they ask you to they ask you why you wanted to study I remember the first day

373
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
I was introduced by the

374
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
The head boss of the group Okay so

375
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
Alex she's going to be all mascot

376
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,191
Because this all Alex's a woman and there never been a woman Gondolier muscles them sought

377
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
For sure

378
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
This was like kind of a joke

379
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
There was a very old man

380
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,407
Who is the latest hit now we have a Gondolier with tits

381
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
For the first several months

382
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,879
Alex says he basically just picked up after the guys you wear the Busboys for everybody so you needed to

383
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
To clean that potent

384
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
To ship out the water

385
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
Like 10 20 *

386
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
A day

387
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
He says it's really backbreaking grueling work

388
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,448
Somebody that everybody everybody sees as a woman you think this would be like the worst place on Earth

389
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,592
But you know actually first those first months in the city just kind of with the boys dirty jokes

390
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
I saw this is great

391
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Alex Newell the gondoliers nicknames walked and talked and acted like them and Kirsten the same way and

392
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,512
He says he felt like he was part of this tradition of new learning from these old guys work mentors to him

393
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,120
Really like maybe the best time of my my life

394
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
It was like he was home

395
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,872
And then the the trouble began

396
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
It started with a journalist

397
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Reporter Consuelo Turin

398
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
We met in the noisy Cafe with a translator

399
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
She was a cub reporter in Venice working for a very politically Progressive newspaper and

400
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
She Was Out

401
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
Looking for her big story and she runs into our

402
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
How did they encounter each other

403
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,224
She was like

404
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
Whoa it's obviously did this is struck her attention

405
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
Araminta santalo here

406
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
It looked at her like there was this woman rolling among men

407
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
In Lake Stevens.

408
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,840
Cotton blend right in the mega

409
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,168
Unusual addition to tennis

410
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
So she looks like a whole morning and basically just

411
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,664
What's Alex's Behavior

412
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:21,344
Alec didn't want to talk so I can talk about it later basically I'm just a student they're teaching me

413
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
Don't make this into a thing

414
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
Recognize that you don't want to talk to me that you're apprehensive and that this might be difficult and I get this my TV

415
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Can damage your reputation with the other Gondolier's

416
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,848
But this is an important story

417
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
Your Pioneer I can't ignore you and so Consuelo said the two options

418
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm going to write the story no matter what so you can either talk to me and we can do the story together or I can write what I think

419
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Leadville Co

420
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,144
You know I said he can't go out now and she said it will

421
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Edible

422
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
And why wasn't Consuelo

423
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Persuaded that she should wait

424
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
They will join this coming from all over the place

425
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
I think the story was going to get out there and somebody was going to write it

426
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,736
And Alex never started stopped and was like listen

427
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Consuelo whoever

428
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Let me just tell you the real

429
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,672
The way out of this is to speak and yet he stays quiet right

430
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Would you ever since why

431
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
I mean

432
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:35,840
Just like some blank data points that might be helpful in understanding kind of where we were

433
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,888
So we're talking 1987

434
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Just to give you like a corollary thing

435
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,872
Where we were in our discourse around LGBT issues was like Ellen DeGeneres I think that year

436
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
This is this is so hard but

437
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
Came out on her show

438
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
I think I've realized

439
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
That I am

440
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
I can't even say the word

441
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
Why can't I say the word like shortly after was canceled

442
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Caitlyn Jenner was just a few years ago like we we didn't even really have a grip on what transgender was that wasn't a conversation that we were have

443
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Having in public

444
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
Can you imagine what it would be like to be like guys guys guys don't worry though I'm actually a man

445
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848
That wouldn't have gone over so well with the dudes at the gondola station

446
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
So what ended up happening after

447
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Consuelo in Allen

448
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Add to Showdown about the article

449
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:30,880
Well couple days later Alex is on the way to the gondola station I found it in the

450
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Newspaper

451
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Stop

452
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
The headline

453
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,704
A woman is challenging the gondoliers

454
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
So I was like I was on my God

455
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Going to be hell

456
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
So it's in the newspaper stand Alex shows up at the Gondolier station of course is a big hello

457
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
Big unfriendly hello hello

458
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
We do everything

459
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
Teach you well and you know

460
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,608
Alex has one of the gondoliers stopped talking to him they wouldn't even let him watch their boats and then the

461
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
The ones who said

462
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
I told you in the beginning told you she's just going to blab to the Press

463
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,920
The whole thing you know what's like a little Stone becoming like that huge

464
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Huge sink

465
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:34,368
By the way this is right this is coming right before Alex is about to take the very first exam

466
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,976
There's actually a series of exams and it gets a little complicated but eventually

467
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
Anybody who wants to be a Gondolier has to take this rolling test

468
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
And by all accounts

469
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Alex was

470
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Good

471
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:51,520
Let me talk to the guy who is ahead of the gondoliers association at that time

472
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,872
This guy phobia Scarpa was like

473
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Is it more

474
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Google the other manga

475
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
And this is the head of the guild

476
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,696
We also talked to this legendary rower named Franco kreia

477
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Alex is better than most of the guys

478
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
Alex takes the test

479
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
And I failed the

480
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Exempt

481
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
Which wouldn't have been

482
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,176
That by itself would have been such a big deal cuz a whole bunch of people fail the first exam but the thing was

483
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,760
There was a feeling that like something deeply unfair was happening

484
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,904
She had analog recording to Consuelo a lot of people started to think

485
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Maybe the fix was in

486
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
So what other boys there

487
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Field

488
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
Who are better than other boys who did not fail suspiciously pretty much all the people that passed

489
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,496
Four sons of gondoliers are from Gondolier families cuz if that's the right last name

490
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Then I got angry I got a lawyer

491
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Alex. This is going to be attention to how corrupt the license practices how crap this Association is I wanted that they exist

492
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,160
Repeat it for everybody and this

493
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
We let everyone retake the test that will basically be admitting that we favor certain families over other families

494
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,376
That was exactly what I want but it's not what they wanted

495
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
They said we don't want the bad press of this

496
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
But then this is another moment

497
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
According to Alex where his story just gets

498
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Hijacked

499
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,872
Myeloid negotiated without my permission

500
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
According to Alex without

501
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,528
Telling him the lawyer together with the gondoliers association dug up this old law that says

502
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,904
Cuz Alex is a woman I mean he's not he's a man but they thought he was a woman and

503
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
Is law says that as a woman

504
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,304
He had the right to take the test again this time with women judges in the boat

505
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
When she came back and said okay here's what we're going to do

506
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Do you remember what you said

507
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Boston

508
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
I was so very upset

509
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,592
That was not what I wanted nothing to do with man or woman

510
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Do you think she

511
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,504
Was your champion because she identified with you yeah for sure I was not my so it's faster

512
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
But

513
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,624
Unfortunately for Alex as soon as the lawyer did that

514
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
It became everyone's story

515
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Oh yeah because

516
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
Is there rain with it

517
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,424
In the next 2 months every paper in town was writing about it

518
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Show me statistics, then the story went global

519
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
Happy to become Banks first woman on the sink first female Gondolier

520
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,832
Build Gondolier blames chauvinism

521
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,416
And then things escalate into a full-blown gender battle

522
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
The gondoliers record super pissed because of all the stress that they're getting we talked to a couple of he likes Gondolier guys

523
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
She didn't

524
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
Disaster

525
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,056
Alex is it 1.6. So bad

526
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
That was one of them was saying you're not going to wait for you in a smaller than the street with a knife

527
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
2 Yuan

528
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
So I grabbed the guy I said where's your knife I'm here

529
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
Get it out

530
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Can do it

531
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,232
That was one episode how many Oz's

532
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
So on the one side Alex said he has Gondolier's wanting him

533
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
On the other than feminism kicked in and Alex said he had all these women

534
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Need to see them

535
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,896
Do you want me to lie because they thought he was a she read in the paper that she had

536
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Try to

537
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Take the test and had failed

538
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
And head cold fowl saying that the venetians remain and the United States system wouldn't let women become Gandhi

539
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
Is this is Jane Capital she was active in the community of Venetian women rowers of the time

540
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:03,680
Women gondoliers at that time but there's a whole community of female rowers they have teams

541
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,032
Isn't a race being doing Venetian Ryan for over 20 years

542
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,592
And being a female rower in Venice

543
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
Who is very difficult Elena this woman roar I was talking to

544
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
Was like I'm routinely when I'm out on the water like old men yell at me and say

545
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
In the kitchen

546
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:31,584
Cooking or cleaning your house why are you here

547
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
You're just a side dish table told me when it comes to racing there's a big discrepancy in the prize money

548
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
Getting like

549
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
Full times as much prize money

550
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
As the women

551
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
We are now trying to

552
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
Convince the city of Venice who gives prices

553
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
We are

554
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Make men

555
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
We are not less than them busting their ass to try to be taken seriously in the sport

556
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,536
We are here we can do this when I saw this press about Alex fighting the gondoliers

557
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
They reached out I sent one of the other considered as down to speak to her when I come to

558
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,568
Bob and come and work with us and help us out help us teach people who got your back but she wasn't injured

559
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
No

560
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,712
Because Alex there are two problems first of all that you cannot compare

561
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,784
The golden robots with racing Ross

562
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
They're two different styles of rowing and second of all

563
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,208
Listens I got was it was kind of like I don't want to roll with you you guys all wear matching white skirts

564
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Like not my thing

565
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
Say I remember there was a lot of

566
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
Resentment

567
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,472
Be one of us in this battle for equality

568
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,544
They see me and then they are convinced

569
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
The times feminist

570
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
But I am one of them and I'm not

571
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
And all of this comes to a head

572
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
In October 2004 when Alex has to retake the test

573
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
And this time with champion women rowers in the boat

574
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Judging them

575
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
There was a lot of pressure

576
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Everything about the test is supposed to be a secret location of the test the path that Alex is going to row of at no clue

577
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
We going to go

578
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
Suspiciously as Alex stepped into the boat

579
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
He noticed that there was a huge crowd wind up all the way down the canal and then difference

580
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
And they're shouting and yelling screaming what kinds of

581
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,392
Swear words in all kinds of go home and

582
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
Canada messenger hate

583
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:41,632
Female rowers in the boat glaring it and there's press lined up along the entire way

584
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
Every everybody has a Bus full of people

585
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
It feels like I'm going to in a ring

586
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,688
I tried to block it all out because I needed to do it next them

587
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
I wanted to do a good performance

588
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
I wasn't able

589
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
It was

590
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
He'll it one of the worst

591
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
Birthdays of my entire life

592
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
I really don't

593
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
I don't wish that to know

594
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Texas real house

595
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728
Hello this is David from Berlin Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan foundation in hunting public

596
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
Understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world more information about slowly www.ops.org

597
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,992
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

598
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:06,112
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

599
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

600
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those

601
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
When a kid you know did something

602
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

603
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

604
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,856
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

605
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

606
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

607
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
If you have a story please share it with us

608
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,848
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

609
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,456
Again that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

610
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I remember Publix this is radio app and return now to a story from Kristen Clark and Dave

611
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Conrad about Alex Haley

612
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
Transgender man who became somehow the first female Gondolier in 923 years

613
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
And that's an international feminist hero sensation and so we now find Alex being painted by everybody

614
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Korean town in colors that he doesn't particularly agree with yeah and what's interesting is

615
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
How easy it is

616
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
To do that to someone Okay so

617
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
I'll tell you as we were doing the interviewing in the reporting I'm like I'm feeling like I have a good grip on Alex Asta

618
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,776
I'm feeling like I know what it feels like to be inside of a narrative it feels really achy and so I feel like

619
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
I'm kind of getting it and I'm like understanding the full Alex and like it's about all of these other things that have nothing to do with j

620
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,992
Gender so Alex's story isn't about gender at all

621
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,392
An end for me that made sense because I was like in my life gender has been a box like even even when you're in the right

622
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
Even when you're in the right box

623
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,792
Gender is a box and it can feel shity to be in that box since I was like yeah let's

624
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:28,192
Bust open those boxes together we're going to show you were going to show people who you are Alex

625
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
We would have these moments where I would be like

626
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
Wait a second

627
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Like one night when we were in Venice

628
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:44,320
We're like trying to park our boat on the way to a restaurant and end like this guy is like trying to parallel park is by

629
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
About and Alex's kind of sitting there like chuckling at him

630
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:57,376
And so the two of them are like me or joking about it and then Alex says like he drives like a woman

631
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
I know it's like you know and the kind of rolled my eyes at it

632
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
But then later at the dinner

633
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
He was like he was like

634
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
You don't like

635
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,736
I don't really think that like a real woman could do this job

636
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
Minions like all like Macho about it too much a thing

637
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Remember this

638
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
Of course you are very right

639
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
A woman can do everything but

640
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
This job

641
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728
Just going to be very tough because

642
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
It's a real cool

643
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Community

644
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Images very cool

645
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,296
But when you said that but when you said that I got so I was like I'm so frustrated

646
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,344
And it was because

647
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
Think I was attached to the idea of like

648
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
It being equal

649
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,768
You know I mean I was I was just like super confused like

650
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
I don't know I just

651
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
I just want to know what you think

652
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
I'll admit in the moment I asked

653
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,592
Clumsy question

654
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,920
Do you feel bruised because you seem to be almost like

655
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,272
Prodding me you know I having fun and winking at David and do you feel like

656
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,856
You're fundamentally on a different team from me

657
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,184
Okay

658
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
I am on David's team

659
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
But you can't see that

660
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,448
Because he's you identify as me

661
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,032
But that does not that I can help that

662
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:46,688
How can I explain it to you let's put it this way when I'm in a group of woman

663
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
For example and they start to talk

664
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
I feel uncomfortable

665
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
The check thing says

666
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
I caught a chicken check

667
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
It's not really my cup of

668
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
TN.

669
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,048
I like it you can amuse me

670
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
But

671
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
The minute

672
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,704
They think that I am one of them it doesn't amuse me anymore

673
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
And if you uncomfortable

674
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
Like I don't I'm a man

675
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
I'm a little alien there

676
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Cuz they think I am one of them and I'm not

677
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
When I'm with the boys

678
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Comfortable

679
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
If it is a nice

680
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,440
Voice which I liked and we have the same type of humor and you know the same

681
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
Stupid jokes about women

682
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
For Alex

683
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144
I think it was really striking is it whatever it is that makes him feel comfortable being seen as a man but not as a woman

684
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,752
It runs very deep for me there is a difference between men and women

685
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
Not everybody or even every transgender person would feel this way but the way that he sees it if there were no differences

686
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:55,808
But is there would be no but no wish to do Transition and there would be no transexuality

687
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,392
It's like that if if it would be the same

688
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Yeah

689
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,656
I see you were singing is like a gender doesn't matter kind of Icon and he was

690
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Saying

691
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Actually it does match

692
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Yeah

693
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
Obsessed with simpler question when

694
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,640
When does he actually become the first female Gondolier

695
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
Also Alex couldn't get one of these

696
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
400 or so special Gondolier's licenses because he failed

697
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,624
Protest in 2005

698
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
I open up my own business

699
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
He figured out that

700
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,280
If he Partners up with businesses in Town Lake hotels

701
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,680
He can actually real for them privately is the time I was looking at those olores and I found that it was false

702
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,008
Possible to open up my own business without having a license so I did

703
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
And so

704
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
For years he was just kind of doing this

705
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,223
Quietly then Alexandra

706
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Square Hotel

707
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Some of the gondoliers began to notice that Alex was throwing passengers without a license and of course they did

708
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
You can't do that

709
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,703
You have to be a member of this organization you have to have a specific license in order practice

710
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
I got some frets

711
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
Bubba fretzin

712
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,663
Damaging the gondola and six kinds of stupid little boys

713
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:32,063
So when they understood they cannot threaten me this way then they

714
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:38,719
Fish at City Hall to change the lot City Hall basically it's like you can't roll

715
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
You can't roll with Taurus in it without a without a license

716
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,215
Yeah it's a one-day Alex is out on his boat and he just gets pulled over

717
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
Basically told you're breaking this new law

718
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
And so I wanted to defend myself so we went on trial in

719
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
Court it was Alex is one lawyer City Hall in the gondoliers association there for lawyers for lawyers

720
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:11,999
I thought this was a lost case any already City Hall

721
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
Lust

722
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
City Hall fights back

723
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Case goes to the highest court in the land

724
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
The lost again

725
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,471
Influence of a quart

726
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,847
With me a little stranger from out of nowhere

727
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
Technically the decision just said hotels can provide for their customers away that they need you so if they want to hire a chauffeur

728
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,903
Who happens to Rowena Gondola they can do that but what that actually meant was it now for the first time

729
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Alex

730
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
Could be considered a Gondolier

731
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
There was a huge deal massive

732
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,711
Fix on Venice Gondola cartel

733
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:09,855
This is where we get all of those articles we read before we came to Venice

734
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
The story went all over the world

735
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,999
And and every single one the message was the same

736
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
We have our first woman Gondolier

737
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,575
I did that was something it was Unstoppable could not go in there and say excuse me

738
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,415
You know I'm not really identifying

739
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
No it was gone

740
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Okay

741
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
It was done

742
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,703
Alex at this point in 2007 doesn't have any other income except for being able to Market

743
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,055
Himself through hotels and eventually online in Seoul

744
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Of course I need to have a website people are actively seeking out this person who has broken the gender

745
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
Barrier and become the first female Gondolier in Venice so did would have been stupid to try to go

746
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
Against all this

747
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:21,535
Was already written so Alex decides to make his email his Facebook page and his wife

748
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
Website

749
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Call Prima gondoliera

750
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
Or the first female Gondolier

751
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
I'm wondering if

752
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
Trading website with that name

753
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,639
Did that feel like you taking control of that narrative

754
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,967
Always that narrative taking control of your decision on that website

755
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
Has nothing to do with what I want

756
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
It's a label

757
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,927
You know I cannot change the label who has seen on 20 years of History

758
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Shut up

759
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,631
Alex told us he was talking to his therapist one day at this

760
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:02,751
Transgender Center they have near Venice and she said you're like in the cage

761
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,079
This is like a cage for you you can't get really out of this

762
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
You know

763
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
It's the it's a difficult

764
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Situation

765
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
It's a very difficult situation

766
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
I'm tired

767
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
By the time we met Alex he been living almost 10 years like this you know just kind of

768
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,855
Between these two stories out to his

769
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Close friends but by day giving these tours as the first female Gondolier in Venice every few months every

770
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
New Taurus season these headlines would just regenerate first female Gondolier first female Gondolier first few

771
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
We left Venice that's kind of where we left him

772
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Hanging in the middle of that

773
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
Any impression that we got is

774
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
Maybe that's just going to be how it always is for him

775
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,415
But why we didn't see each other so

776
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
Fast forward six months

777
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
We get an email from Alex

778
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
He says he's in San Francisco

779
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,631
Happening in your life

780
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
He had some news

781
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:42,335
Well you know I don't remember what we were sitting with a stalking in Venice

782
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
And we were sitting on the Terrace

783
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
I remember the

784
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,295
I was already in a news about something coming

785
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,719
But I wasn't sure what it was

786
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
It was a very difficult yeah I was kind of depressed with

787
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
You know I'm not I'm not that depressed person usually so I was hanging out

788
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:19,199
I was not moving much it was hanging out on my on my cell phone and I was

789
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,807
Trying to think and I was

790
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,975
More and more everyday was telling me that I was she another he

791
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,863
I don't know why I got completely intolerant before I was like I don't care what they say to me

792
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,263
I care that they're nice and now I was last night I can't do this anymore

793
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,663
Alex was about to turn

794
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:54,783
And it turns out that part of what was happening

795
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,855
Was that he was beginning to go to the early stages

796
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Of menopause

797
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
I will

798
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
Hot was tired

799
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
Breaking out for nothing

800
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
After fighting with the gondoliers fighting with a feminist

801
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
This

802
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
Would like a final insult

803
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
So

804
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,567
I have this idea that humans might help

805
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Wiz how I feel

806
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
I start to take the

807
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,967
The testosterone that was on the 7th of November

808
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,759
Which of the six hours

809
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,599
I get V smile on my face and in the end

810
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Amelia yeah

811
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,975
Next thing you know I felt so good and the mood swings.

812
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
So I'm

813
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,119
No I'm like I knew me because I was looking in the mirror everyday Mall

814
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
What's this monster

815
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,727
He decided to fly to San Francisco meet with a doctor

816
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,103
Some people to wait like 2 years or 3 years before they start to do a surgery

817
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,711
I want to do it now because for me it was something like now or never

818
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:00,063
So now I'm here in San Francisco

819
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
Surgery on The Voice

820
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391

Busybody witches

825
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Confirming me

826
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:25,407
People see me as a first woman laundry means something for many people

827
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,735
It's not fair to them so you know I need to

828
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,271
I needed to say something

829
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,111
What changed on the Facebook side of change the name

830
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,927
No it's Alex I going to let loose

831
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
And

832
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:43,839
I did already a statement on my on my old website Services statement

833
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
It says

Colleagues and Friends

836
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,543
After holding myself back for three decades it's time for me to depart from my wrong body

837
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
I'm not changing who I am

838
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
I am becoming who I am

839
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,111
It is he back in Venice now yeah

Life

842
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
