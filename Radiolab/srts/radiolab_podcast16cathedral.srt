18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
They live in a small house in Loveland Colorado

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
They fell in love chatting online got married as soon as I turn 21

20
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Images of this house

21
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
The very next day

22
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
Response to my emails and then we'll head down

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
They had their first son Caleb

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Their second son Isaac

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Ryan was

26
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
Computer programmer and Amy take care of a cat

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
They were just living in a mess of diapers and toys

28
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,472
Going to church every Sunday and then

29
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
In 2009

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Agile

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
When Joel was born

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
How old are you

33
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,064
If I was 25 when Kayla was born and then Isaac was born I would have been like 20

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
7 - 28

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
I was 2800

36
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
Everything was normal sign

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
And then just a little before his first birthday

38
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
Amy noticed that his head was a little boy

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Tilted

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Decock to one side

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
A couple days later he starts throwing up

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Can't keep any food down

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,152
And so they do a bunch of tests and the doctor says listen your son has

44
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Elysian

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
The counselor

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
So they biopsy the tumor and then they come back with

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Snooze that it's something called in a trt

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
It's very very difficult to treat so when you have an atrt

49
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
You

50
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,120
Go through all the most intense chemotherapy and all the most intense radiation they throw the kitchen sink at it

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
And doing that you have about a 50% chance of surviving for 5 years

52
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
I double check this and it turns out the odds of survival are even Grimmer it's a 50% chance of snow

53
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Surviving just two years

54
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,320
When you hear this kind of news is there any part of you that's like

55
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
What are you doing

56
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Do the treatment I remember

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,024
Before his first surgery asking them a lot about likely have to have chemotherapy and thinking to myself cuz I can't

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
We can't we can't do this

59
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
This is crazy we can't do this

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
Botanas timer on and by the time we actually when I heard about that

61
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
That tumor

62
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,104
Then you're just thinking like 50% like that's half like we got a good shot that he gets through this

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,528
What do you think Isaac he's in the hospital so they're taking care of him

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,624
This is from a home video of jewels Brothers meeting him in the hospital

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Isaac is two and a half

66
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Looking kind of scared

67
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,816
Jaw is a little over a year old he's lying in a small red wagon

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Hooked up to an IV

69
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
Skinny and his head is perfectly round

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Food

71
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
His food goes to that too

72
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Yeah

73
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
So they start going through this treatment starts off with intense radiation and then just you know months of chemotherapy

74
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
I didn't know what that meant it means that you just hold the baby for 6 7 8 hours a day

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
You just lying in bed with them while they get these infusions

76
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,559
And so do you like this 8-hour pump and you took it up at night and it would be this

77
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
Like this white milky substance

78
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,215
That would provide all of his nutrition because he couldn't swallow very well

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
One day it was Amy chef

80
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
She was holding Joel is sitting in his room with him ever seen him a song and clapping

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
And he was clapping his hands

82
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
And then he was sort of like Babble singing along and so like for me it was just one of those moments that you felt like I'm always

83
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Remember this

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
Like sometimes you just have a moment and you going to remember this the rest of my life

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
A man that made me sad because I thought

86
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,375
Old like but the reason I think I'll remember this the rest of my life is because he could die

87
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,519
Until eventually I did just kind of decide like I think I need to be all in like

88
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,871
I think I need to love him like mad and I think we need to live our lives like he's going to live

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
That's what they did

90
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
4 year

91
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
And then in November 2010 just before Joel 2nd birthday

92
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,367
The doctors call them in and they say

93
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
We're really sorry

94
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Joe has another tumor

95
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,583
All these chemicals we've been pumping into him they didn't do anything and so it's time for us to stop

96
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,935
He will eventually die we're not sure but we thinking about 4 months

97
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
But as Shruti Hassan explaining the story

98
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
That definitely wasn't it

99
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Cuz there's this one night when situation was

100
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
You must had his worst

101
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,623
And something happened to stomach bug you throwing up got dehydrated

102
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
So Ryan spend the night with him in the hospital

103
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
I just remember I'm really wanting apple juice

104
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,327
Cuz I was one of his favorite things at the hospital but then I give it to him anytime

105
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,959
Throw it up again and he's crying and crying and his prize just got more frantic

106
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
An animal and there's nothing that Ryan can do

107
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
I just remember like I wanted to hold him and I couldn't put him down because he would get so upset and

108
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:20,159
Put him down Joel would start hitting his head against the wall of his crib eventually Ryan himself started

109
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,559
You said he was crying too and then in the early hours of the morning he lay down

110
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
And prayed

111
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
And I remember that's when he stopped crying and he fell asleep

112
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
I was just one of those

113
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Smooth few moments in life where

114
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Like it felt like an answer from God

115
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
And

116
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
It wasn't like I Heard a Voice or saw

117
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,415
You know a burning bush or anything like that but it was just it felt so much like

118
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Mercy

119
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
And Beyond just Shear relief Ryan had this

120
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Other thought

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Franklin

122
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
A weird thought

123
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,727
This whole ordeal reminded him of a video game

124
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,615
Like you have to get the baby to stop crying so you keep trying things give him choose bounce him talk to him

125
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
But the weird thing is

126
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
This awful game

127
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,295
None of those things actually work they're all like fake choices

128
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Brian thought

129
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
What if

130
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
I can make a game like this

131
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
Where you the player you don't really have control

132
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
And so he starts to think like

133
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
I wonder if I could make that

134
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,727
I can make that scene we could make the scene of Joel in desperation and then give him an option

135
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,079
Is that the thing is is there any active saving being a no

136
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
So he's going to make a video game where everything you do doesn't work baby still cries

137
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
I think he was just intrigued by that because it seemed

138
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Bizarre

139
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Yeah

140
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
I'll make

141
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Video game where you

142
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Can't do anything

143
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
Set prayers

144
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,839
High likelihood of being a popular game popularity

145
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
Not essential he wasn't even thinking that cuz he wasn't thinking oh this is a game that I will release it was almost like a thought

146
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
Experiment right in his brain where he's thinking

147
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
You know usually people come into a game trying to solve it

148
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
And I wonder how if I can make this game where they couldn't they would understand me

149
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
How I feel right now

150
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,903
I want to make a game about that day that Joel is dehydrated in the hospital

151
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,023
Facebook terrible that's not a game and no I don't want to play that like

152
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
Think of that word game men like

153
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
Something you do in your leisure time

154
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
You know and so who wants to spend their Leisure Time

155
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,335
Reliving the worst moment of a man's life so I said do not make that

156
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
That is horrible

157
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,967
He come to the idea so finally Amy said okay I'll give you 3 months

158
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
So

159
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,207
A few months later it's the game developers conference in San Francisco

160
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
Alongside Assassin's Creed 3

161
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
Battlefield 4 the new Oculus Rift VR headset

162
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Hi everybody my name is Ryan

163
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Bear

164
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Was Ryan

165
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,151
My son Joel had just turned one-year-old the day that we found the monster in his brain

166
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Ryan is standing in front of

167
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
A bunch of young Tech dudes

168
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
You're listening

169
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Half-heartedly

170
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Joel is alive and fighting his eighth tumor are doctors fight for him our family fights for him

171
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
And we serve a God that's the god of the living not the dead in the middle of all this pain and suffering and mud in her ass

172
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
The cancer is right in our family we have a drink of water

173
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
That's made of hope and love and light and we hope to share it with

174
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
Amy stayed home

175
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Reading because

176
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,247
They were almost out of money and she was worried that Ryan would come home

177
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Feeling crushed

178
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
But that's not what happened

179
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,951
Ryan got back and said it was amazing

180
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,327
This person introduced me to that person that person is just in that one there's two or three different people

181
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Who want to fund my game market for a game like this but different

182
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
So I want to be clear it

183
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
The world of these kinds of emotional games it's a small one

184
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
But

185
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,503
There are people there investors in there who are looking for games

186
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
They're doing something different

187
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Meaningful in some way

188
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
And so I think a few of them

189
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,231
Wade through the scene this dehydration scene

190
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
And they thought

191
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
Okay let's let's let's see what a full-fledged version of this will be

192
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
End

193
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
We're just

194
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,847
It's like a video game generation has grown up right like if you were born in the 80s

195
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
The seventies

196
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
But you played games for certain reasons when you're a kid and now we're grown up and we're having these different experiences like I'm child going through

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Cancer

198
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
You know the death of my father or

199
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
These things which suddenly you're like

200
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Why can't I tell the stories with video game

201
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,863
And what was Amy's reaction when she heard people wanted to fund the game

202
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,983
Because of your dehydration game that I told you to never make and he realizes like

203
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
You never played it like you never play this mean

204
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
So I put on the headphones

205
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
She finds herself

206
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Back in the house

207
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
You don't see Joe

208
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,831
You see an empty crib and you can hear him cry

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
You're playing as Ryan

210
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
Move your mouse around the screen

211
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
And options

212
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Appear

213
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
You can give him choose you can try to bounce him you can

214
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Walking to the bathroom

215
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
Look at the window but no matter what

216
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
You do

217
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Trying to fix worse and worse hold you please

218
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Stop

219
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
After five or six minutes of this

220
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
Brian sits in a chair

221
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Drops his head into a glass

222
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
And praise still here

223
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
And then

224
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
The crying stops

225
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
So I put on the headphones

226
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
And I just lost it and I was just

227
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,407
Is crying and crying and I knew Joel was okay and he was like right there like Jones right there with us and

228
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
And yet

229
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Brought me back to that space in a much

230
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
More

231
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Real way that I thought that a video game

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,791
Amy didn't need any more convincing she said okay let's do this

233
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Pull the rest of our savings and make this game

234
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
They named it that Dragon cancer

235
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
I'm just use the same teas that reply all using their podcast coming up

236
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,671
Ryan and Amy encounter what might be the world's biggest design problem

237
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,087
This is Riley Lawrence from Woodland Hills California

238

For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories

252
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those two

253
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
So did something

254
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

255
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,751
Kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

256
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:41,407
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

257
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

258
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

259
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,607
If you have a story please share it with us and go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record

263
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
A couple who have a key

264
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Who's fighting cancer

265
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,655
And the mom and dad have decided to express the experiences there going through interval things a video

266
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,775
You're so Amy and Ryan and their 6-person team they begin to build the scenes of the games

267
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Surreal

268
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Vignette

269
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Were you the player

270
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
You take on different characters and every senior

271
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Job Your Role basically is to

272
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
Can you take care of baby Joel

273
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Let's not go back to

274
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
The peace and two swords

275
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
The first scene is at the pond

276
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
You start off as a duck

277
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
You paddle two words a little boy it's Joel

278
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
Or the origami version of him

279
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,935
He doesn't have eyes or mouth but he has a voice

280
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
And that is actually Joel's laugh

281
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
As you hand them pieces of bread

282
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
A throws them in Stillwater

283
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
I know you try

284
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
Goldilocks 5-light

285
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,087
Yeah kid speaking Heroes Isaac Jones brother

286
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
But you can't talk

287
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
True

288
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Do you want to talk

289
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Nano

290
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
Don't got sick right after eating one

291
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
Volume down a little bit buddy

292
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
There's other vignettes

293
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Like

294
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,479
There's one time in a hospital when to keep juul entertained

295
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
Ryan blew up surgical gloves like balloons it's this for Justine where you see Joel

296
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
Loading into the nighttime sky towards the moon holding on to these

297
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
Surgical balloons

298
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,143
And then you see these black birds appear from the corner

299
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Doctor cancer

300
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
And a pop the balloons on my one

301
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
And throughout these scenes

302
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,479
You play Minigames you discover rooms listen to voicemails from Annie there's even little levels you can beat

303
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
But the cancer is always around the edges of this world

304
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Barney and black

305
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
I'm Creepin in

306
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
At one point you'll arrive here

307
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
The waiting room where doctors tell Amy and Ryan the jewels cancer is terminal as they break the news

308
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,751
Rain start pouring into the room

309
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
And Ryan slowly starts to slip under the water

310
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Monday

311
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,951
We're very good at 8

312
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
We're very good at managing cake and masking symptoms at the end

313
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,639
Just jumping one second we asked Rudy so as Ryan and Amy and the team were crafting these scenes

314
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
What was happening with Joel

315
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
She says what happened

316
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Surprised

317
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Thing that happened was

318
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
That tumor where you know the doctor said listen he's terminal

319
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Going to be over soon

320
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
The radio

321
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
And it goes away

322
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
And then a few months later

323
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
He gets another tumor

324
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
The radiator

325
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
I goes away and then this happens again and again and again

326
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
And so

327
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
He's two years old he's three years old he's four years old he's doing things that the doctors never thought he would do

328
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,919
Bucky Turn 2 and 1/2 and said his first word

329
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
Num num

330
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
He starts to swallow again

331
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Don't shut the food

332
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Starts

333
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,023
When he's three

334
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,399
He just became this miracle baby somebody in their church that they had a vision

335
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Women in the church told her that she had a vision that Joel would do great things

336
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
Another reason they wanted to make this eventual is because they felt as if

337
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,527
He has Christians they were living a miracle

338
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,087
And they wanted to share this with people and show them

339
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
And then

340
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
A doctor calls a man and he says listen

341
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
Joe has a new tumor

342
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
The steamer is different

343
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,167
It's in a place that we've already radiated explain to us

344
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,775
That cannot continue to radiate an area too much what can cause brain death

345
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
And it was right

346
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
On

347
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
The brainstem

348
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
The doctors say we're not going to radiator

349
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
And then what happened

350
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Is condition

351
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,599
Like very rapidly deteriorated

352
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Having more trouble breathing can't swallow again a lot of the things that he was able to do like walk and

353
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
B stops

354
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
And so

355
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Bay invite their entire church Community to come to their house in

356
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,567
Pray we had a prayer night just praying for him to be healed and

357
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
We just had everyone over and we spent hours just worshiping and praying this video footage of the snow

358
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,599
It's in there small living room there's family members friends people from their Church community

359
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Ryan is holding jaw and they're praying

360
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
What we have is death here on this Earth

361
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
That's all we have

362
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
The only hope we have is your Resurrection.

363
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
Why would hope

364
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
All I have is my disappointment

365
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
That's what I start with

366
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,175
But I have hope that that you can fill my disappointment that you make it right that you redeem it

367
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
Yes

368
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
What's your strongest memory from

369
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
I think it's just realizing that he was gone

370
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,856
It's that space of being with a bunch of people that

371
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
Desperately want the same thing that you willing are crying out

372
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,816
For that Grace in that Mercy to convey the situation

373
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
Joel died later that night it was March 3rd

374
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
13 2014 because we were believing that he would be healed and because we were believing even if he died

375
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
I maybe should be raised from the dead like

376
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
Which is my cousin weird and I don't get that is weird but because

377
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,976
We still believe that he could live I feel like we didn't

378
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,792
Go through all the processes of getting ready for him

379
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
To Die the way that maybe you would

380
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
If you are certain that this

381
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
So at this point

382
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,568
Undertale sweetie tells us well they had to finish the game

383
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
Lemonade invested in enormous amount of

384
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Diamond heart

385
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
Talent in building this game

386
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
But now

387
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
The facts of change

388
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
It started as a game that was supposed to be about

389
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Experience of

390
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
Fighting cancer but also the experience of

391
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Try and think of her

392
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
It can't be that game anymore

393
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Like what do you do as

394
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Game designers

395
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Parents

396
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
How do you finish a game where you don't have many choices

397
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
And you can't win

398
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,056
It fits part as we're talking with treated me so visual

399
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
She just

400
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,664
Sat down and walked us through as descriptively as she could

401
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
How Ryan Amy Ryan

402
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Try to solve this design bra

403
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
The end of the game

404
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
North Shore but it was basically going to be a two-part scene

405
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Where there's the moment of his death

406
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
Yeah and they weren't sure how to

407
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Do that

408
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
There's a moment of his death and right after that a moment where he goes

409
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
I have an essentially there was this little Island

410
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
And so

411
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
Ryan sucks about making

412
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
The scene of his death

413
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
It starts off

414
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Pretty simple

415
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
In a hospital there's

416
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
Little Jaws sitting on a green chair

417
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
And there's some tubes of this neon fluid feeding into him

418
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
And there's pipes

419
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
All that rise up above him Witcher like pipe organ pipes and there was a little bit game play where you can play the pipe organ anyway

420
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
And then after that

421
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
He said

422
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
This isn't this isn't enough

423
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
This is the scene where

424
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
My son dies and so it must be

425
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Just like

426
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Epic

427
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
And so he creates this almost european-style like oversized

428
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,432
Cathedral where you know the walls are soaring up in the

429
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
Ceilings are intricate and contain all these different

430
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Like

431
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
Bod

432
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
It's almost as if he's coating Joel's body into the architecture so he is

433
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,328
You know pieces that look like ribs and there's this part that looks like it's heart I can show you guys this picture is its

434
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,680
Sound Transit Howard told your laptop to the glass

435
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,544
I just quickly want to show you this

436
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
That's amazing

437
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Is so

438
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Pretty

439
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
I was not prepared for the

440
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,832
Who TF is very intricate interlacing arches

441
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
Light cascading down.

442
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Catacombs on stained glass

443
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,560
He's very ornate ceilings and sweets. The building that

444
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
And it's beautiful and it just gets bigger and bigger and then suddenly feels like you know this is too light and

445
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,592
So then the cathedral becomes a place of darkness and all the lights are neon

446
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
Oh so now it's very

447
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Does trees growing into the

448
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Cathedral now that's the cancer

449
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,808
And then he's in the space and he's like so what should people be able to

450
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,136
Doing the space we have all the scene of these tubes and things

451
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Fruit for chemo

452
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,536
I want to put in the machines that we're keeping Joel alive so we were feeding him

453
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
With these nutrition IV things we had

454
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Oxygen tanks

455
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
And we trust building actual equipment

456
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
That the user would have to like

457
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
Fiddle with the levers and you know make things just right so that the jewels getting what he needs to stay alive

458
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
Does anything

459
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,272
Oh well if they do it wrong then they'll feel as if Joel

460
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Died because of them and that's terrible

461
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
Enter Then he says you know what's crap this whole thing

462
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,488
Shruti showed us maybe sixty different sketches

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
A different iterations of a

464
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Cathedral that were all

465
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,168
Super detailed in a kind of Terry Gilliam on steroids sort away

466
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,472
My friend since there is one sketchware

467
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Ryan head head head head built an entire

468
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
Amusement park in the cathedral

469
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,200
And that was supposed to represent all of Joel's favorite things

470
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,296
Now it's all there just like too much stuff it's distracting so then he takes up the whole

471
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Amusement park

472
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
And then he puts in

473
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
These prayer candles

474
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,072
He's like you know really what I want people to take away is this feeling I had

475
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
On the last night of Joel's life

476
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Where

477
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
All you can do now is pray

478
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,288
And so you like one of these candles and you hear a prayer from that night

479
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,176
Boys Life returned to him to not let you go and let

480
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
And it's been hard I can for both of us to get to a place where we say

481
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
It can't say all the things

482
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
The cathedral

483
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,720
Can't say all the things we wanted to say just had to cook something else in the game cuz we couldn't finish it

484
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
And it's hard cuz you just want to never finish it and make it as beautiful as possible

485
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,984
And I don't know like there's part of it feels like we've betrayed a project by finishing it and by saying it can only be

486
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
But of course

487
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
They have to finish it

488
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
There's investors

489
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
There's a release date was disappointing to me

490
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Is how quickly it fades

491
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
Dole how did how the memories in the

492
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
The person of dulfersitz because he

493
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Start here he's a

494
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
He becomes more and more an idea

495
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
This

496
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,328
This game is not him it's just an echo of him it's not

497
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
It's not even the best echo of him

498
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
I think that's the thing that I'm struggling with

499
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
As we as we're approaching the end of this

500
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
Do all this

501
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Or why it why is it that

502
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Why do we do this

503
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
The game is coming out mid January

504
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
The cathedral to Ryan will always be

505
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
Unfinished

506
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Can you show me the last scene with app

507
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,728
Ryan was able to finish the place that comes right after the cathedral

508
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,544
It's the scene where you say goodbye to Joel

509
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
You find yourself in a boat

510
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Next to Joel

511
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
There's no oars

512
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
You're headed towards an island

513
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
You got there

514
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,088
You walk along a small path and you end up in a clearing in the woods

515
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
There's a picnic blanket

516
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Angel sitting on it

517
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
I'll remember you

518
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Related to

519
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
I'm glad you're here

520
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
I love it here

521
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,752
I bet you would like it too

522
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
And around him all the things he loves about

523
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
Pancakes

524
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
A huge stack of pancakes way way bigger than him

525
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,808
A little dog

526
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Bubbles

527
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,720
You can call him bubbles

528
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
What I can catch one

529
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Simplytoimpress long as you want

530
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Okay

531
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Occasional

532
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Heavy metal

533
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,408
And you just keep blowing bubbles

534
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
