1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:24,320
Okay ready 3-2-1 hey time Jedi been wrought iron rubber College this is Radiolab

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,952
And this is part two of our attempt to answer some listener questions that are piled up over the years

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,792
Gathering digital dust in our inbox

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
Come from kind of close to home

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
Starting us off this round is a question ask her

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Who has developed

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,544
Quite a reputation here at Radiolab

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
Scott little

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
I'm just a normal dude man Scott spoke to our producer a lot of Nasser

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Send us a lot of questions that got her attention they don't they don't stop I can't slow this brand on it

14
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
I truly do not even remember like writing why is the moon

15
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
We seriously not translated any animal language is yet is there a reason coconuts look a lot like she pansy

16
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
He had just a coincidence

17
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Zeroed in on one of Scott's questions that at first seemed kind of simple but it got really

18
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Ibig

19
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
When a space shuttle goes into space

20
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
How do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellite

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Is it chest radar

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Is there some kind of complicated cyst in the tracks all of them in and since we talked it's kind of looking at the bow

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
About that she know about like how many satellites are Acts

24
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
The up there

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
What are we even calling space junkins

26
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
And has this affected anything

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Yeah

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,592
You know it's just like it it goes from like kind of informational to like

29
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
Almost like this sort of Doom and Gloom real fast like

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,552
There's so much junk up there like it's going to be impossible to leave the Earth's atmosphere pretty soon

31
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
And I don't know I just it just kind of

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
I'll be curious to see what what

33
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,560
Who's who's in charge of all this that's what I want to know

34
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,168
Okay is everybody there

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
Willing to talk to you about space surveillance

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Yes I'm here

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
So I couldn't actually find anyone who is literally in charge of space

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
But I did find what I think is pretty much the next best thing on the commander of the 18th space control

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
I think your title has got to be the coolest title of anyone I've ever interviewed

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
The commander of the 18th space control Squadron

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Amazing

42
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,080
Okay so so let's start from the top when the space shuttle goes in the space how do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellites

43
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
We keep track of wood called the space catalog of all the man-made stuff

44
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Surrounding Us in outer space

45
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
A little over 23,000 objects whenever there's a launch anything mad or unmanned

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
We'll track it again

47
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Disgusting things in catalog and will make sure that it doesn't hit anything on the way out

48
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Up there and then

49
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,960
If there is a chance of an actual Collision they send out an alert

50
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
The notifications we create are called conjunction data messages

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
Send several thousand of those everyday

52
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Thousands we have a more refined what we call emergency criteria

53
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
Between 6 and 10 of those per day

54
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
What

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,536
That's a good that's a lot but when you consider retracting 23,000 objects

56
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
But on top of those 23000 object

57
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
It turns out there's there's even more stuff out there

58
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
But she says it's basically just

59
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Too small to be able to track

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,456
We think that they're probably more like a half a million close to half-a-million on

61
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
What's you have like almost none of them

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,368
It sounds like that but just remember that some of those

63
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Frost 500,000 objects are very very tiny pieces of debris

64
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah what are we talkin about

65
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
But the paint so there's no way you can track like

66
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
Half a million flexor pain that feels like

67
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Stop feels like impossible

68
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Metal window

69
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
That was hit by a flock of pain

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,855
And the kind of damage that it can do moving and tell me what kind of

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Speed what what

72
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
Yeah what would I see if I saw that picture

73
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,303
Several layers of the shuttle window and they determined that it was from a Fleck of paint

74
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
I'm just you know what tiny flag

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
So you got almost half a million pieces of the

76
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,519
Itty bitty space junk

77
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Keeping our fingers crossed

78
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
And

79
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Monitoring the situation

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
I'm so we can react to it if something happened

81
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Okay

82
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,807
What's up when I when I called this listener he's like

83
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
She's a little bit

84
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Paranoid

85
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,023
I think it's called the

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
The Kessler

87
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
Syndrome that what it is

88
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
The castle

89
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
That's what it is

90
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,751
NASA scientist got this thing named after him

91
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,103
Bernese like we might get to a point where we have so much stuff in space

92
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
That like

93
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Something will collide with

94
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,807
Wait like two satellites will collide and that Collision will cause so much debris but it will basically be like this

95
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,695
Giant thing we're just like things are just exploding around the earth for like years and years and years.

96
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
Some sort of locust plague

97
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Space Jam

98
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,095
Swarmed with a locust plague of space junk

99
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,959
And that it'll be impossible to leave the Earth's atmosphere anytime soon

100
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
What would you say to Scott

101
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
This is Steve

102
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
We have

103
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
We have a job to

104
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Attractive object

105
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
A question like that

106
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,231
Is this kind of out of our realm of responsibility

107
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
And just let me ask another question then tell me

108
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
If you can answer it that's fine too

109
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
Which isn't he also brought up something called the keslow effect

110
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
Do you know about that or have you heard of that before

111
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Which is which is the idea that

112
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
There's a possibility that two satellites will collide and then milk

113
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Create debris and an idol

114
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
Make a domino effect and cause all kinds of other

115
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Collisions and then it'll be

116
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Ahold giant debris field

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
I'm sure we've heard of it the Kepler effect

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,887
Okcastle are sorry about that

119
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
And is that something you worry about or no

120
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Hello

121
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Hello hello

122
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
I guess it is a concern

123
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Her butt

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,303
The members of the Squadron do such a great job tracking everything that's up there that we would hope that that wouldn't happen

125
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,055
I thought nothing nothing but the answer I was hoping for started this whole thing

126
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Thinking that

127
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
Scott Speer was like kind of crazy but then after that conversation I started

128
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah researching it for real and I

129
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
Online I found this video of Kessler himself there was a general attitude

130
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
The space was a big sky that you can put anything in it that you wanted and not fill it up to the problem that you quickly running

131
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
He basically says exactly the way we operate in space all this results in exponentially

132
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
Free until all objects are reduced to a cloud of orbiting fragments that are capable of destroying any

133
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
Spacecraft the 10th operate anywhere within that cloud

134
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Which would mean no satellites

135
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
The weather satellites no GPS satellites and then

136
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
In the future if things go really badly

137
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
You know we just be

138
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Stuck here

139
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Forever

140
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Andeavor

141
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
On Earth

142
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,287
Our next question comes from the sky in Brooklyn and he is

143
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
That would be fine

144
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
5 years old

145
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
And I interviewed him

146
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
Dad are going to go in my kitchen

147
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Who r u t g

148
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
And I'm your son

149
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Okay tell me your question

150
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
The question is

151
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
What's Earth color

152
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
Why is the earth called Earth

153
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
I don't know why

154
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Give any guesses

155
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Just came up with the name

156
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
The Earth came up with its own name

157
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
I think

158
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Should I find out and then tell you

159
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Yes

160
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,271
My first stop was a guy named Peter Peter Barry

161
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Isotope geochemistry I work at the

162
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
The University of Oxford

163
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
My research

164
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,743
Am I right that you have some kind of loose affiliation with NASA is that is that not right

165
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
In a sense that I mean I do a little bit of

166
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Planetary work I've worked

167
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Lunar samples

168
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
In the past but you work on lunar samples

169
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Yes I've actually done some

170
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Isotope work on

171
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
It's actually one of the few people on the planet who

172
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Held the Moon

173
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
In his hand

174
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
So here's my question I think it's pretty simple but maybe there's a

175
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
The story there I don't know

176
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Question comes from

177
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Tej via me his dad

178
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Why is the earth called the Earth

179
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Well that's that's a really in

180
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
Question the Earth is actually so this is

181
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
And it's in

182
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
In Old Saxon

183
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Derive from

184
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
English dramatic

185
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Roots in German

186
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Earth is sad

187
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Erda

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
I believe the guy die

189
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
German

190
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
And of course all these

191
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
All these words are originally drive from

192
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
A mother language

193
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
An endo your

194
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Working mother length

195
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,175
What it means in German and what it means and all those old languages

196
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Actually just means

197
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Soil or

198
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Ground

199
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
All the other

200
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Planets all visible

201
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Have these really

202
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Awesome name

203
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
They're all named after Roman god

204
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
I mean you have

205
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
Mercury

206
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
The move really quickly around the Sun

207
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
So it got its name from the Roman messenger god then you have

208
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Venus

209
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,895
Does this Bright Beautiful or blowing in the sky

210
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
So we named it after the goddess of love

211
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Of course Mars

212
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
Which was fiery and red

213
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
And so we named after the God of War

214
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Earth is the only

215
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Planet which is it named after

216
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
A Roman god

217
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
He clearly has

218
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
This much different

219
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Etymology

220
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Peter ultimately referred me to another guy.

221
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
Classify the game please

222
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,127
I speak and yeah this is Gabriel Berry

223
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,455
To the price of indo-europeans probably were sure

224
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
Proto proto-indo-european

225
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,879
Yes so it's so basically that what Gabriel Berry told me is that you could

226
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,487
You could trace all this whole thing the word or back to this

227
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Group of people who lived in a day

228
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
This is like way before JC way before

229
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
For the Greeks or the Romans

230
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
The proto-indo-european

231
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Lived in

232
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Especially what's now Eastern Europe

233
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Cities already people from

234
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Steps

235
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Russia

236
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Don't know a lot about them

237
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
We know they moved around a lot

238
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,039
People couldn't for whatever reason settle down at some point maybe about

239
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
5000 years ago

240
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
From the steppes

241
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Eastern Europe

242
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Russia

243
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Swept into Europe

244
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
It seems I drive

245
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Chariot

246
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Imma came on horseback

247
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Make huge wave unsettled away from

248
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Button down too

249
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Northern India

250
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
Imagine This

251
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
This wave of people on Horseback spreading

252
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
All over Europe in an India and

253
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,527
Speaking this language they would ultimately Branch out into English and German and French and Hindi and Portuguese and

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
400 some odd language

255
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
Spread across Europe

256
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Crosstown

257
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
India

258
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Underground

259
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Daughter's day started to slow down

260
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Settle down

261
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
And that's when they start spending a lot of time

262
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Looking down at the dirt

263
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
We have lots of words for founding

264
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Plow

265
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
Or as in the world that would become Earth

266
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Evidence that early point adjustment dirt

267
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
And presumably adjustment like

268
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Vistaril

269
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
But this specific

270
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Little

271
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Piece of dirt

272
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Right here

273
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Then I'm plowing

274
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
It's somewhere along the way

275
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
That word

276
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Herta

277
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Became the word for Alder

278
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
The whole ball of dirt

279
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Basically the word that starts Benji

280
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
It comes

281
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Same word

282
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Beautiful then

283
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
And also

284
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Quite often

285
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
We have no idea when that

286
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Switch

287
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Happened

288
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Exactly

289
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
May we know within a

290
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
P2000

291
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Whenever it was

292
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
That strikes me as a pretty important moment for us people

293
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Can I ask some questions

294
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
When did you discover the Earth was a planet

295
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
Don't know really what did you discover do you remember when you when you learned

296
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
If the Earth was a ball

297
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
When

298
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Nice to you don't remember to you

299
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Baidu

300
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Now you don't

301
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Yes I do

302
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Little nest

303
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Little

304
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Coordinate age

305
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
That moment for him happened to daycare

306
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
This place called little Nest Brooklyn

307
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Vanessa

308
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
It was a day when his teacher Vanessa

309
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Had them do this little

310
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Project

311
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
She said we were going to make up

312
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Our own

313
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Pushing her

314
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
On what

315
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
What is that mean

316
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
That means

317
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
And make

318
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
Two eyes

319
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Awesome legs and tomorrow

320
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
IC

321
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
They're basically making this Earth pop

322
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
And he says after they did that

323
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
You were sitting on the rug

324
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
That way you have your best ideas you sitting on this little rainbow colored rug that they have hold Nazareth puppet

325
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
I was thinking

326
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,503
I was singing of the Earth

327
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Lights Round

328
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Smooth

329
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Round

330
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
And it's a

331
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,975
Cipriani

332
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,607
By the time we get from the Proto Indo Europeans to the ancient Greeks and Romans

333
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Couple thousand years

334
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
You begin to see the concept of Earth rising up

335
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
It goes from a simple word that means dirt or soil

336
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
To Mother Earth

337
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
The goddess

338
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
So it went in the opposite direction of the other planets

339
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:56,159
It started as lowly dirty thing beneath our feet and then became divine

340
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
When I told Sage this answer he was disappointed

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
You sexy hoping that the Earth was named

342
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Buy an alien

343
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,263
Daddy night-night another question

344
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Sun-maid

345
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
How is the sun made

346
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Give me like how how did the Sun

347
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
Become the son and that's another good question

348
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head

349
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
What does he know that I mean

350
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
BFFs best friends forever what is BFF best friends

351
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Are you ready

352
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
Does Dunkin Donuts have it maybe no no no like you like here in America they have people coming in that I think somebody comes with

353
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,543
To the truck what do you do with it what you have done it before how did I do that I don't even understand

354
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Tell Simon

355
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Door in here

356
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
Next Step black please

357

568b

358
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Thank you thank you the Adler family

359
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
As a user Simon Tyler and his dad

360
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
So a couple weeks back

361
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
I'm just heading out of town now

362
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,727
I asked my old man my dad to record himself going on a drive

363
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
All good road trips deserve, coffee and being approved

364
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
Individual but I am I decided that a drive-through at McDonald's would be the appropriate

365
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
He and my mom live in Northwestern Wisconsin in a small Lil

366
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Little city town called auclair

367
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Going to drive

368
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Country Roads

369
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
In specifically what would I ask him to do was to go drive on the county highways just outside of town

370
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Passing

371
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Farm field areas there are very few cars on the road that I'm on

372
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,711
The reason I asked him to do this was because for as long as I can remember

373
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
He's had this nagging

374
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Question

375
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
A question that he bombard me with every time I'm home off times when were talking

376
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
On the phone he'll bring it up by 9

377
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,119
Can you hear me yeah that's the dinner table over email I mean I've heard about this at least

378
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
600 *

379
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,983
What does Mom think about all this I've never asked her

380
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
She just rolls her eyes

381
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Yeah

382
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Yeah so what happened

383
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,807
So do you want me to tell you why why I'm recording or do you want me to I knew we would get

384
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,415
So you can tell me now I thought maybe it was going to be like that I had

385
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Figure out

386
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,559
Let me let me just prompt you with this and see it see how well you take the bait here

387
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
Do you know the question I'm talking about and could you just

388
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Tell me what that question is

389
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
That

390
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
Question is

391
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
Well let me back up an example is this

392
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
A person will be riding a road bike

393
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
Down a lonely Country Road

394
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
Two other people

395
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
Will be walking their dog on the side of

396
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
10 days

397
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Semi-trailer truck

398
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,839
Will then be coming down that road

399
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
Okay so we've got three different actors here

400
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
And nobody else for miles and miles and

401
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And there is not at you having

402
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
The biker hasn't seen another car

403
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Or pedestrian

404
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
4 miles on this road

405
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
But what will happen is

406
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
All

407
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
Three of those actors will come together

408
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,183
At the exact same point in the exact same time

409
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,791
Creating a dangerous situation first of all

410
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
But then it's just

411
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
And then it diffuses

412
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,007
And you could sit on that stretch of road for six more years

413
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Cannot find that app

414
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
And the key thing here my dad says is

415
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
Kia Tim Adler

416
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
When is this sort of thing

417
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Give me a lot all the time

418
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
I would say it happens

419
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
Once every two weeks

420
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,183
Upcoming we have the possibility of an event

421
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
On the day I sent him to record himself

422
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
After 10 or 15 minutes of not seeing a single other car on the road

423
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Cam'ron this band there's a manure wagon

424
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
Being driven by a tractor

425
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,287
Right down the road and yes

426
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
We are here at all happens

427
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
The manure wagon is going down the road

428
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
Attractor has just pulled out on the road and now I'm passing by

429
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
And all three happened at the event

430
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,696
Same place it just happened

431
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
What is your

432
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,352
Question then is it why does that happen or is it a question is

433
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
Why

434
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Does this happen to me

435
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
Does it seem to happen to others as well

436
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay

437
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,856
Take it to the bottom of this we called her man who he thought might just have been

438
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
I'm by Professor MSU Professor David Spiegel

439
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Does that mean you've been knighted

440
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Yeah yeah yeah

441
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
You're a knight you're the you're the first night I've ever spoken to

442
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
Time to stop

443
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,176
The probability of me talking to her

444
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
Professor sir David is a statistician repartido

445
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,368
When I ran my old man questioned by his response

446
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
People contact me and they get very anxious

447
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
Because they feel it something's going on in their lives but making things happen all the time they're getting signs from the environment

448
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
Random

449
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Synchronous

450
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
That was the time that call Young invented

451
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
For this. It isn't entirely

452
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Vine 2

453
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Through space and time

454
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,600
Carl Gustav you know the famed psychoanalyst of the 20th century

455
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,976
Dreams or visions of the future

456
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Behind night shut that we didn't

457
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
County recognized

458
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
But did Drive these things to have

459
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,424
Something beyond the normal rules of

460
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Physics and kites rationality

461
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
So he really believes

462
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Dental for

463
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
I think he just

464
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Wasn't very good statistician

465
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Because

466
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,784
Sir David says when you start to look at the events in our lives in terms of their probability every single event.

467
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
Unbelievably unlikely and unpredictable

468
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
Soak the crucial thing that measures it for the surprising

469
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Is the unlikeness of it occurring

470
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
At some point over a reasonable period

471
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,144
And just I don't know I'm trying to make this as concrete as possible so

472
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Good luck so if you're driving down the street

473
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Yeah that has I don't know

474
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
3 cars

475
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
10 MI

476
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
NJ bikers / 10 MI

477
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah yeah likely is it that over the course of those 10 miles you're going to intersect at the way that he does

478
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,784
The likelihood of that happening any

479
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Particular 10 miles ready to take Chlorella

480
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Is very loud

481
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
It's a surprising event

482
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
But if your father drives a lot

483
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
The likelihood of it happening over

484
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
I didn't make a week

485
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
2 weeks

486
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Suleiman

487
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Is very high

488
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
David says think of it this way

489
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:12,288
Let's say my dad would consider one of these intersections to be a meaningful coincidence

490
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Synchronous event

491
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
If a semi truck in a biker pass him

492
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,736
Within five seconds of each other

493
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Now

494
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
If in 1 hour of driving my dad sees say

495
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
15 cars

496
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
5 biker

497
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
The map tells you that the likelihood of one of each or both

498
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,376
The car in the bike passing him in the same 5 Second window

499
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Is about 1 in 7,000

500
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
But

501
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
Think of how many of those 5 Second Windows there are in any given week or month

502
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,688
In fact think of each of these 5 Second Windows as like

503
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
One spin of a roulette wheel

504
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
Giant roulette wheel with

505
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
7000 different numbers that you could bet the ball would land. But

506
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
This is Keith

507
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
When my dad's driving it's not like he only gets one spin of the wheel for one chance to see

508
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
See one of these synchronous events

509
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,104
Instead it's like every 5 seconds he gets to try again

510
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,432
Given that he drives like 3 hours a week

511
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
When you do the math

512
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,064
What you end up with is a 31% chance

513
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368
A-Team experiencing Mis in any given week

514
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
Meaning if he's looking for it

515
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
He should definitely expect to see one of these

516
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
At least once a

517
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
So you have to

518
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
Not look at just the Avenger not just

519
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
The particular thing your father exist

520
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
You have to think all the time

521
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
For those things because it didn't

522
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
You know you got to think of all the stuff you're not singing

523
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
How are you

524
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152
Pretty good fish

525
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,968
Quite the fish if you'd like its Third cast

526
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Call my dad back

527
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
To break the news to

528
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
All right you want the answer

529
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Yes

530
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
So

531
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,816
We can explain it to him from the history of Yuan to the fact that he's really just got to pay attention to all the times these coincidences

532
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Aren't happening

533
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
Right and when you look at it from that angle it's

534
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Statistically to be expected

535
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
There

536
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
I understand

537
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
I understand

538
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
It's a little hard to swallow

539
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
I'm a Little More Union than most

540
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
It it does make sense

541
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
From a statistical analysis

542
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
But why does it

543
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Happening to me

544
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,256
So these things do happen to some people

545
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:45,376
Because your friend so sick right now. It doesn't happen to people who are very sensitive

546
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:50,496
Underwear and then notice their environment they're pretty mindful people that happens to

547
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
I was just what I'm saying is this is a real admirable

548
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Your characteristics

549
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,712
Well there's no question this makes my day when I've heard that I've been

550
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Raised by a knight

551
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
Elias highness that someday we should go out for a cup of tea

552
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Not to bring it down though

553
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
He he told his praise on you I would love to meet you I'm sure he's wonderful but I would

554
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
I think I would say that

555
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
He's not very special

556
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
You didn't really have

557
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Tell me that

558
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Sorry sorry

559
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,600
Now that's okay that I'm going to just listen to the first time

560
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
Alright okay enjoy the rest of the day of the week thanks I love you and I'll talk to you

561
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
Tell Mama give her a call and hopefully tomorrow morning

562
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,888
I love you too

I want to ask you one question

567
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
I just relax

568
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,720
We're not in Kansas anymore

569
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:53,120
Where do I go

570
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
You know where you are

571
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Where am I

572
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Hi this is Jacob calling

More information about Sloan

579
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Www.

580
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Sloan.

581
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
I listen to Radiolab so much that I actually

582
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Part memorized

583
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,016
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

584
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
And I'm here because I need your help

585
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
And I request

586
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
For those of you who

587
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

588
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Aunts and uncles

589
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,864
Teachers looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

590
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Brilliant

591
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Basically I want to hear about this

592
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
When a kid you know did something

593
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
It just means you lean back and say

594
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
How do they do that

595
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Maybe it was the moment that I

596
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,224
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

597
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
Or maybe the kid was a piano

598
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,880
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

599
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Or maybe the kids in math class

600
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,744
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

601
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
We're interested in the

602
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Epic moments where

603
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,888
A kid does something super smart

604
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
It doesn't have anything to do with it

605
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
If you have a story

606
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
Go to radiolab.org

612
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Thank you so much

613
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Jad Robert Radiolab we are back

614
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:06,240
With more questions okay so mixed up Yeah by name is Evan Becker we're going to go to Boston with Eva

615
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
Becker and here is his question

616
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Boston-area still in box

617
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
In today

618
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Kind of relevant today

619
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
The question is is something of a snowboard

620
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,296
Snowboarding for 20 plus years or so

621
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
Friends and I OST

622
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Usually go up

623
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
Uibe

624
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
New Hampshire Vermont in New England area

625
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,072
Yeah and you know a mini years back on one of these group trips they took

626
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
And I

627
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
Recently opened a

628
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
Don't you mean course

629
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,240
And by the way that tiny

630
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
That's a producer Tracy hunt

631
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
And then another friend jumped in and said I bet you I can get that up to like a hundred miles an hour easily from the top of the mountain

632
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
No way

633
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
You couldn't even do that in purpose

634
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Addition

635
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
And from this small little

636
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
Disagreement

637
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
From there and I was in 2004

638
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,264
Going on for more than a decade and over these 10 years going back and forth in the back and forth on this question

639
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
Everything is Friends gradually focused in on the rules

640
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
What's up

641
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
An event

642
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
They came on this very specific wording

643
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
So the question is

644
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
In perfect condition

645
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
Within the Earth's atmosphere and I was in the back

646
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
Can you read

647
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
100 miles per hour going down a mountain

648
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm

649
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
And everyday

650
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Like an inner tube

651
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
It's the same thing that you get if you went to a local hardware store

652
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Nothing fancy nothing

653
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
Andover the engineer

654
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,848
And still to this day some of Evans friends are like yeah we can break a hundred miles an hour we can

655
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
It happened he says no

656
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Cannot do that

657
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
But I think it can happen

658
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
I think you can happen

659
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
That is Destin Sandlin host

660
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
Of an extremely popular YouTube channel called

661
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,632
Important smartereveryday cuz he is very smart on his channel but Destiny does

662
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
Is he proposes

663
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
So you probably observed that cats

664
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Almost always land on their feet

665
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Questions

666
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Today's question

667
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Is why

668
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
Questions a lot like Evans Wiki then proceeds to answer

669
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
GGG

670
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,296
I think that's in your also an actual rocket scientist

671
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:33,440
I've only I've only said that one time my mom corrected me very quickly she's what

672
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
They know

673
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
I'm what's called a flight test engineer so we test missiles and helicopters and stuff like that

674
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
How do you say one thing before we start

675
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
I feel like before we jump to the answering part of this

676
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Conversate

677
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
I want to appreciate what was the question

678
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,432
I'm wondering is there some like physical

679
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Are there some physical reasons why a hundred would be really hard to do

680
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
In an inner tube down a hill

681
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
So this is what I thought about when I first heard the quest

682
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
So if you think about going down a hill

683
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
There's two things that are slowing you down

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
The first one is the friction with the snow

685
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
In the second one is the era's

686
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
Which progestin all boils down to something to eat

687
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Drag

688
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,800
1/2 times the density of the air coefficient of drag

689
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
So this started as a really simple question in my mind

690
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
NSI started

691
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
Gaming out how to

692
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:34,368
How to do this without killing the person the more I thought about it the more I realized it can get very very calm

693
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,208
Yeah I can I can show you all those equations

694
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
But I can't work them out on the back of neck

695
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
Mostly because

696
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Math is hard

697
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,448
Still he did tell us that he could he was pretty confident that he could get this

698
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Tube to go down more than a hundred miles an hour.

699
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
Yes I'm saying that it can happen

700
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,640
Are we sure that somebody hasn't done this

701
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,712
And posted like their GoPro video on YouTube

702
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Well I guinness world record

703
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Oh gravity

704
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Powered snow

705
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Well what is it what what's the what's the world record

706
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,304
Okay so at this moment Destin's wife Tara Sandlin

707
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
She's in the studio cuz she's with him on vacation in New York and she's been looking at her iPhone

708
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Epi Guinness World Records website

709
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
Gravity powered snow sled

710
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:29,920
134 km per hour

711
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
3.5 under

712
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
Remedy power questioning everything about what I believe

713
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:44,768
A sled is meant for velocity of two business values faster

714
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,352
Omani miles an hour

715
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
Would you slow here so so here's the deal

716
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,496
I'm different than most people I I'm not going to die in this Foxhole

717
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
It's clear that I'm wrong

718
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,968
I would go with this this is what I would do

719
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,272
The real thing that the tube

720
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Causes of problem in my mind is

721
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
All the friction on the

722
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,880
On the mountain

723
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Right so I mean

724
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
Within the balance of the question because he

725
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,792
He went to all these Great Links to Define what we could do and what we couldn't

726
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
He did not

727
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,376
Tell us what slope the mountain had to be on

728
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,728
And so what we're going to do is work and go to the worst possible Mountain imaginable witches

729
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Straight down

730
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,544
A cliff basically

731
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
Okay are we all on the party line

732
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
And so with the help of producer Tracy

733
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Evan

734
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,736
And in Destin

735
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Can you hear me

736
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,832
Do you want to Devin the questionnaire to hear what how death is going to work.

737
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
This thing out good we're all together

738
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
To break the ice with answers are

739
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah so this is ultimately a question about terminal velocity

740
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Rewrite

741
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
In theory

742
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
If we were to

743
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Go straight down

744
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Like

745
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Out of an airplane

746
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
We would go as fast as we can

747
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
Can ever go because the only thing contributing to the

748
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
The terminal blocks

749
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
See that point

750
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Would be dry

751
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
No friction

752
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
I don't know you what would you do

753
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:10,272
Except the answer if I'm able to go a hundred miles per hour straight down out of an airplane

754
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
For example

755
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
Would you say that it is pause

756
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Maybe you even if our

757
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah even if our Hill is only

758
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
1 degree

759
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
Off of in a straight down towards the Earth that still counts as a

760
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Alright

761
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
Yeah I guess so

762
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,424
Yeah as long as it's going downhill in the Earth

763
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Yeah

764
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,824
Yeah I want to call I got a buddy named Paul here in Alabama he owns a place called

765
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Skydive Alabama

766
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
I go to church within the same all the time

767
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:42,784
And I think he became so distant like I don't know like

768
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
Seaway call him from your phone or something is that what you

769
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
What you think going to try to do

770
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
So

771
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Paul reset Her Go

772
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,280
What's up man are you ready for me to merge you

773
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,632
Alright Paul you there

774
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Hi Paul how's it going and we have Evan who had those who had this crazy question about snow tubing

775
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
Okay

776
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
When's the whole inner tube thing in a toaster

777
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
Suspend Pollak we want to know if you could jump out of a plane go straight

778
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,368
Could you break a hundred miles per hour barrier

779
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,928
Is that safe can you do a test like that

780
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
Yeah it is totally possible I've done it

781
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,072
What weight

782
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
You done it with an inner tube

783
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,984
Absolutely.

784
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,616
Closest two different occasions he in a bunch of friend jumped out of an airplane

785
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,200
Carrying an inflatable flotation device in one hand

786
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,832
I watch a little computer to track their speed on the other side it how fast did you go

787
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
In both cases it was over a hundred

788
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,048
Really

789
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
The same it's as if it's as if he has a virtual Mountain

790
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
He jumped off the question specifically said on the mountain that these guys have been arguing about this for a decade

791
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,504
We're going to come back to them and be like noon or just drop out of an airplane

792
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
True or false and that's where you go to law school you and stuff like that what did you read the question I am now

793
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
I hereby recusing myself from this whole affair

794
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Do we have we have we have ceased

795
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
You truly in good faith answer the question and furthermore we get the guy on the phone

796
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:42,080
Phone and we Hoodwink him into accepting a renegotiated contract.

797
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:47,200
I am I would not be a party to this

798
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Hangzhou

799
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,640
Tell us where we're going next eat so the next one is

800
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
From our producer Annie McEwen hello

801
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Any

802
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Dad

803
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,112
So what are we going to be talking about to question you bring us

804
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,464
Okay so this one is a little bit different

805
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,072
Because it didn't come in from a question came in the form of a very tantalizing email

806
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
From a fellow named iron Hendricks

807
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
Iron Henry

808
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,984
From Amsterdam high iron

809
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Yes it's me and he's basically said ham iron I'm an artist and it just want you already left to know that me and my friend

810
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,456
We are building a building and island of fat

811
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
And Island

812
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:30,880
Yeah I know a couple of all the things to build an island out of wife at

813
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:36,512
I'm just fascinated by it I just like thinking about it that made you start

814
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,656
Looking at fat in a curious way what was the moment

815
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
A friend of mine and Mike Thompson and we are in a train

816
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
Going to Amsterdam

817
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,759
Are you feeling fat or what what what

818
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
We're weird guys

819
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,903
Great joke about things like this like the chips

820
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Ray Wise or something and then we started talking about how in the English newspapers that has been this news

821
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Stories about pepper

822
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
Stop birds that are under the ground in the sewers of London just like wreaking havoc

823
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
And there was one

824
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151
It's actually in the Oxford dictionary since 2015 is sick an actual word

825
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:31,039
How fat burgundy Iceberg look like

826
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,647
Well I mean like a sort of Imagine Iceberg I guess but this one's floating on the water

827
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
In the tunnels Underground in London

828
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
And is made entirely of

829
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
That and a little while ago Hernandez friend Michael actually got to go down into the store to check out these fatbergs

830
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:51,775
And it was an amazing experience through it with these waiter hip waders on

831
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
Pushing bits and pieces of fat side

832
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
Drains for the trampoline

833
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,735
Gooey stuff inside of the sewer

834
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
Where is you have is that a picture of it of a fatberg

835
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:09,183
Oh my god wow yeah so it's so it's like this like clumpy lumpy Mass

836
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
Girbaud jeans

837
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Fat stuff

838
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:17,631
Gray and brown and it's filled with all the sewer stuff when I'm sleeping

839
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,959
Fungus grows on it completely block

840
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
The Old Brick tunnel

841
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,895
Underground so this is like this is like based on the things people have eaten there so much fat in people's dies here and such in the sewer

842
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,527
People throwing fat away like taking bacon grease thrown down the sink cooking fat down the sink

843
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
Yeah and in September of this year in London they found a fatberg in the sewers that weighed as much as 11 double decker bus

844
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
That's how much fat

845
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,863
Shut up in one place oh my God

846
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
Engine is at the Thames water

847
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
The Civil War Oregon

848
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
When's the giant fat blob plugging London

849
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Describing the news

850
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,943
Spectacle lake monster monster

851
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
But I mean I felt like

852
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Maybe fat

853
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Is it a monster

854
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Maybe it's just like

855
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,183
This this giant thing in the world that's

856
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
It's trying to express itself

857
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Young States

858
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
Appreciation

859
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:31,103
I make up 20% of your body that

860
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
He wasn't he's celebrating fat and so he said that

861
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,831
If as an artist you're trying to explore water you don't just drink it out of a glass

862
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Rock Your Body

863
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
Appreciate

864
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,863
What's that experience it in all these different ways

865
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Check engine

866
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
We just want to have this

867
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,943
And is that where he came up with the majestical idea of building a fat Island

868
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,039
Citibank

869
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,135
Spot off The Wharf in Amsterdam and right there in the ocean water

870
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
He's building this little

871
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:22,303
Floating blob of fat waste materials

872
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
Sometimes you're just buying it

873
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
Right now it's like 15 feet across and it's just like they're hanging out

874
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
Alive movie

875
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
Always changing

876
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
We give ourselves

877
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,367
Maybe another half year or a year and then it should be finished interview

878
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,415
Haha actually how big do you hoped

879
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
To get it can you think of

880
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
At like it's a big as a truck

881
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
Or a blue whale over

882
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:02,751
Oh my God that would be amazing just of course my dreams are like the my dream is that I won't be able to

883
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
The end of it

884
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,615
But that's not really realistic I suppose I mean

885
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:14,527
The size of two or three trucks would be amazing already and then you have a real thing I mean it's probably be able to stand on it

886
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
It's something I would like to be able

887
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,439
It'll be pretty good then. Then you can really sexy college at Island summer

888
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Definitely

889
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,815
Yeah I know it's strange but

890
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
But I know that I love it

891
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,471
I know the time when I'm there I I really love that little

892
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Thing that is there in the water

893
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:43,455
If we were that uses as part of the show I need you to give me some kind of

894
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
Question that I can try and answer about that and it sounds like you are are doing a lot of questioning

895
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,903
I would really like to know when it was like

896
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
I'm very very very curious about

897
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
The relation

898
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
Okay or even when did set start because we know when certain species of animals started

899
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
More or less when the universe was created right

900
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
When was the first set

901
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Okay

902
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
This is something that I would love to know

903
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
When was the

904
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
The first five

905
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Fat

906
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
It turns out that the

907
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Very very first

908
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
Version of fat

909
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,439
Has been around for

910
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,279
Pretty long time

911
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Before Big Bang

912
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,799
The actor star form in exploded then you can start forming

913
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
Okay so this is

914
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Is aqueous geochemist

915
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,991
Tom McCollum in my pajamas

916
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Teamweek

917
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,343
I told Tom told me that the earliest earliest version of fat

918
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
Was a harbin

919
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Oxygen compound

920
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
Arias Arias

921
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
Hydrogen carbonate

922
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
So first

923
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Eat Hydra

924
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,143
And hydrogen comes along with the big bang

925
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
So we get there really early

926
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,727
Then we have to wait for

927
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,311
Start a forum starting at Old assorted Diana

928
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Explode

929
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
And then you get carbon and

930
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,735
And that carbon and oxygen along with the hydrogen is now a certainty

931
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,039
Swirling around in this Interstellar space

932
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
Dust stuff

933
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
And when those three things

934
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Come together

935
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
They start to make these

936
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
These shapes

937
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,559
So you have like a chain of carbons linked together

938
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,119
And each one of those carbon has equal height

939
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
James Bond

940
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,959
Carbon hydrogen chain

941
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,079
And then at one end is the what's call the carboxyl group

942
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,639
Carbon hydrogen and oxygen

943
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,223
Yeah so I like to think of it kind of like a flower

944
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
The stem of the flower is hydrogen carbon

945
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
The Petals of the flower contains ox

946
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
As well as carbon and hydrogen

947
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
And there's fat

948
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
And it's little

949
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Flower likes

950
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Long before the earth existed

951
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,327
Floating around in space

952
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,471
Savannah Sun and the Moon and the Earth

953
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
In the planet

954
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Indy car source

955
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
And on the surface of the Earth

956
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
After it's cooled

957
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
You got fatty acid

958
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:27,551
Now we don't know exactly how they got there whether they formed on the Earth itself or came from like

959
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,623
Meteorite smacking in the Earth

960
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
But the important thing is that fatty acids are there

961
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
And there's also a lot of water

962
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
Water is important because

963
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:43,423
That's the thing about these little fatty acids is that never a hydrophobic into the molecule

964
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
So hydrophobic means

965
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
Scared of water

966
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,311
It is a first quarter

967
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
So are fatty acid flowers the oxygen end the the flower end

968
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,927
And so if there's water dispenser like and so all these flowers form

969
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,279
Desi can imagine it like a bouquet that is so full that it is a

970
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Sphere

971
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
Show all the flowers on the outside cuz they'll of water and all the stems on the inside they're hiding from the water

972
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
The all the fat flowers

973
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
Join together

974
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
Because it allows the

975
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
Water heating parts

976
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
The Hyatt

977
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
And the water and loving parts

978
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Beyond the surface

979
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,711
But this is all like longpre life

980
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
This is life has no idea what it is yet

981
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
Life hasn't even thought about

982
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Coming on the scene

983
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
But there is a theory

984
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,951
That is one of many theories out there

985
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,303
But there's an idea that when these little fat flower bubbles for Minnesota

986
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
Primordial sea

987
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,399
They're kind of taking a little hair pulled the fluid

988
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
Rounding them inside with

989
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
Whatever your fluid

990
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
Going to get trapped inside there

991
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
So on the inside they've got

992
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
Some things

993
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Some visitors

994
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Some visitors

995
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:03,551
And the theory goes that maybe one of the things around in the sea that end up getting pulled inside one of those fat bubble

996
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,367
With a little floaty bits of genetic material

997
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
Like it with a little bit of RNA

998
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
And then

999
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
For the first

1000
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Time ever

1001
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:16,095
Instead of random bits of RNA floating around in a CPC

1002
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
You have

1003
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
A cell

1004
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,031
For the first time you have an inside

1005
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
You have

1006
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
A you separate from

1007
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
The soup around you

1008
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,407
So

1009
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,199
The Fat Ball

1010
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
Bandirue threesome from outer space and Levy landing gear and maybe Hood cool

1011
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,415
The first container that made life possible

1012
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
That's right

1013
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
I don't think there is any way to really have anything like we call a living being without having

1014
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,143
A membrane

1015
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
Separated from this round

1016
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
That is really important

1017
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
Propounding

1018
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
What is

1019
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
Is without father would be no us there we beheld we we are we are we are built in houses effect

1020
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,271
So that means when you get your soap bar out of the shower you should give it some respect

1021
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
Is so fat yeah I think so

1022
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,671
Traditional sopes

1023
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
You don't know everything.

1024
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,655
But I think I'm actually excited for I'm to hear this because I feel like

1025
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,055
I mean what can convey all the way that the beginning of Life

1026
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Can hear me

1027
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
I wonder what he'll say

1028
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
So I called on again

1029
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
And this time

1030
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,015
Just had a conference

1031
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
I have to go to this conference

1032
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
I didn't know what was coach Webb because

1033
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Colts coach

1034
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
But you're everything is covered in fat

1035
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
Taking over my life and I just have to deal with it

1036
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Anyway

1037
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:57,471
So I wanted to tell you what my sign just told me about

1038
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
The earliest

1039
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Spermicide

1040
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
Can I tell you okay

1041
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,615
Think of a way to put this succinctly

1042
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
I told them everything I learn

1043
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
Barrier between us

1044
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
And the rest of the

1045
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,039
So that makes it makes

1046
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
Yeah

1047
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,927
Yeah and it could be that these Lee be like early early fatty acids

1048
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Are the sting

1049
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,511
That make life as we know it

1050
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Possible

1051
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Exodus

1052
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
I suspected it

1053
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Why

1054
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Yes

1055
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
How'd it go

1056
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
Intuition I guess

1057
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
It's beautiful

1058
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,799
This is how it's supposed to be this is what I've always dreamt of

1059
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Pittsburgh stocks

1060
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615

Jessamine Lovelace

1062
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,503
Nice that's when I tell you that I don't know that's right

1063
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
This is what

1064
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
This is why I live

1065
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:26,559
A lot of people to think for this these two episodes this is actually a real group effort but one particular props

1066
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
Stupid Easter Tracy hunt in that kill t-shirt

1067
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,727
Spearheading the whole thing to Bethel and to Bethel hopday for a huge production assist

1068
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
It should you have a question

1069
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,335
It's burning in your brain

1070
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:44,735
We know exactly at Radiolab wnyc.org

1071
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
I'd like to get them for you

1072

Or in a tree

1076
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:07,263
Okay we say goodbye I'm I'm chat album thank you for listening and

Dirty question

1081
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,983
What is this mean your ass I've been wondering all day too. Let's get to our question

1082
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,079
What do they do that

1083
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
I want to be

1084
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
What's the question

1085
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
