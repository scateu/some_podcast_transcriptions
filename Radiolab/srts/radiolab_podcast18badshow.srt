14
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Jad abumrad Robert krulwich I feel like we haven't you and I sat together and said her name's and quit them

15
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Because you because Molly's been in the chair series

16
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
You haven't heard it yet this is a kind of a rush through to sex reproduction what makes boys boys

17
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
Girls girls and the Infinity of gray spaces in between

18
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,832
And now that we're sort of just on the other side of that

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,464
We thought that maybe the as is return to Corner ourselves we should refresh

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
But even that sort of way

21
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,656
I mean it's just one of those things we've been bringing back shows that we think are just vibrating

22
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Still in the world so at a time when there are people all over our country and other people

23
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
All over country and thinking she's bad

24
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
He's bet your bad I'm good you're bad there's a there's a lot of black and white thinking happening right now yeah and so we've

25
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,136
Decided that it's time to go back to something we did once upon a time when we were wondering

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
About good and bad we did a show called The Bad show start asking me questions like what makes a person inherently

27
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Good or bad is there a way to

28
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Explain why some people act the way they do and others

29
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:29,504
The little bit of bad that is in all of us and he's really really bad that is in some of us

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Yeah hello David

31
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Yes hello

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
Who's that oh hi Pat

33
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Let's begin with this story from our producer pack

34
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
That guy

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
Okay so I heard this one from this guy named David was David

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
Redbus2us

37
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,168
He's a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin

38
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
And this particular story comes from a book that David wrote

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Can you just

40
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Just tell me

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
The little

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Story that you

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Begin your book with

44
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Okay yes

45
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
This is

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
One of the things that

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
This is one of the things that spark my interest

48
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
In the topic of murder

49
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
The whole thing happened several years ago

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,744
I had a very good friend another professor at the University and I used to socialize

51
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,352
With him and his wife and one evening they were throwing a party

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,496
And invited me over and so I went to the party party was already in full swing when I got there

53
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
I walked in and asked his wife

54
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
Where this friend of mine was

55
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
And she

56
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
Got a disgusted look on her face and said that he was

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Up in the bedroom

58
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
And so I went up to the bedroom

59
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
To find him and he was

60
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
And in a rage

61
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,000
In a rage how like you walk into the room what would you find

62
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
Well he started he started fuming that his wife head

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Had distemper

64
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
And what did she do she expressed

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
Disapproval about his

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Clothing choices

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
She made fun of a shirt or something

68
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
But did it publicly in front of her friends

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
So it's kind of a he felt publicly humiliated

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
And while David sitting in the bedroom with this friend the guy looks up at him

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
And he says

72
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
I'm going to kill her how did he say it like quietly or like truth is

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
Keith and I'm going to kill her

74
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
David

75
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Always known this guy to be

76
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,263
Pretty mild-mannered but he is a

77
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
A large

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Very strong

79
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Man with a black belt in karate I knew what he was capable of

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
So I suggested that we go out for a walk and I basically spent the next half hour away

81
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,511
Walking around with them trying to cool him off but eventually he did

82
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
He just

83
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Calm down

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
And you go back to the party then in like

85
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Continue

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Dinner partying

87
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
For a while yeah I did good too

88
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Yes and he did too

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
And then

90
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
He seemed

91
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Fine

92
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
When I said goodbye to him he seemed calm and

93
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
I left and went home

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
And it was

95
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
Several hours later in the middle of the night that I got the call

96
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
And it was his friend and he says, I come over and sleep on your couch

97
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
I don't leave my house right now I'm going to kill her he was in this

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
State of Fury he said an in instead of

99
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Hitting his wife he smashed his fist into the bathroom mirror and

100
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
Then realized that he had to leave the house or he was going to

101
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,855
Do damage to her an event so he says that in your like

102
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
Okay yes

103
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Come over now like

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Yeah

105
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Exactly

106
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
Meanwhile leave it at night on the other side of town his wife

107
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Went into hiding

108
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Literally disappeared for 6 months and didn't tell anyone where she was because she was terrified that he

109
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
He was going to kill her

110
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
This story made us wonder it is David's friend

111
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Easy unusual

112
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Or

113
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,527
Does everybody at some point have something dark in the

114
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Just tiptoes

115
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Justin Time

116
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Yeah

117
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
This is Radiolab today

118
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
We're going to get

119
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
This is a bad show

120
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
So you asked why do people do bad things

121
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,959
Relaxing me to be bad anyways like how do you tell the real Baddies

122
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
From the rest

123
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Snap timer

124
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,079
Omron automatic Radiolab

125
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
The bad show

126
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
Back to back

127
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Okay so

128
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
What happened to David that night with his friend

129
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,999
I'm really curious about murder and Badness and all these things were thinking about

130
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
But it wasn't until a few years later that

131
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
He weren't something that

132
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
Really put what happened that night into contacts

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,519
At this point David moved on to a new University and he's teaching an introductory psychology

134
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
And I devoted one

135
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Class session 2

136
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
The topical

137
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Homicide in white people

138
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Kill and

139
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
I designed a little

140
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Questionnaire

141
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
Where I simply asked the students

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
And I've have you ever thought about killing someone

143
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
And they would Circle

144
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Yes or no

145
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Then he wants some space at the bottom

146
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
For them to elaborate

147
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
If they said yeah

148
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,631
And you know the class ended and I went back to my office and I just

149
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Sat at my desk and started reading these

150
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
And I was just

151
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Astonished

152
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Define page

153
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
After page

154
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Of yes

155
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
And not just yes

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
But these very Vivid

157
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Descriptions

158
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
About who they would kill

159
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Where they do it

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
When

161
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
The precise method

162
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
How many of them went into that kind of detail

163
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
I would say

164
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
75 or 80%

165
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Wow

166
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,071
A little bit like horrified like oh my God my students are murderers

167
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
Horrified as I was

168
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
I was pretty stunned

169
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
And so

170
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
I

171
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,335
Expanded the sample where we asked about five thousand people all of the world

172
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,711
Singapore jeru the UK that's in question have you ever thought about killing someone

173
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
91% of the men

174
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Said yes in 84

175
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Percent of the women

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
Said said yes I've thought about killing

177
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Yes

178
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
If any

179
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
A sizable fraction actually acted on their homicidal

180
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Can I see the streets would be running

181
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Running red

182
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Yeah but that's the

183
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Actually seemed like

184
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
But here's one more than just fantasy

185
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
From

186
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
A woman

187
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,663
Sure okay this is a 20 year old female

188
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
We asked who do you think about killing

189
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
She said my ex-boyfriend

190
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
We live together for a couple months

191
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
He was very aggressive

192
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
He started calling me a w**** and told me he didn't love me anymore

193
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
I broke up with him

194
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,119
Then a few months later he started calling me trying to get back together but I didn't want to

195
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
He said that if I ever had a relationship with another man

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
He was going to send videos

197
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Of us having sex

198
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
To all the people in my University

199
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
The thing is

200
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
But I do have a new boyfriend but my ex boyfriend doesn't know it

201
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
That yet

202
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
And I'm terrified

203
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
But he'll do what he says

204
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Then suddenly the thought occurred to me

205
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
That would my life would be much happier

206
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Without him in existence

207
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
And then she said I actually did this

208
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
I invited him for dinner

209
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,887
And as he was in the kitchen looking stupid peeling the carrots

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Make salad

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,263
I came up to him laughingly gently so that he wouldn't suspect anything

212
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,103
I thought about grabbing a knife quickly and stabbing him in the chest

213
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Repeatedly until he was dead

214
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
I actually did the first thing

215
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
But he saw my intentions and ran away

216
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
I went to ask how close she came to killing

217
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
She estimated

218
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
60%

219
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
I don't think I've ever had a fantasy that

220
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
That anatomically specific Ryewood

221
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
See the part of the other person that I was going to say

222
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Forever

223
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Planet like that well

224
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
Have you ever been blackmailed away this one

225
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
No no one is ever sent about a s******* that I've ever

226
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
So you don't know it is a fair question to ask

227
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
What are the conditions under which you

228
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Premier any of us

229
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Baidu

230
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,575
Thanks I think they have to be extremely extreme

231
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Well know how my lighter.

232
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
You know what the sex brings us to our first stop of the Arizona

233
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
Just to set it up Robert I'm going to give you this piece of paper here

234
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
What is this

235
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
Edward Paris read these words that use these words

236
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Nice day

237
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Fat

238
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Mac yes

239
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Sad

240
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
Face what are the soft hair I don't know what this is

241
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
I want you to commit them to Memory

242
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
Give me some the memory you know and your finger and I'm going to

243
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
Little electro-jazz finger clear-air

244
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Give me a paper bag

245
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Already comes up

246
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
So I'm just going to go in

247
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,191
What what

248
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
I'm not ready for this

249
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
To the best of your memory

250
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
Which word is mashed with knife

251
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Okay I'm choosing

252
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Job

253
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Wrong

254
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Actriz de 285 volts

255
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
What did you just do

256
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,431
Obviously no need to be alarmed that was not a real shock we were just in acting an old

257
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,039
Great famous experiment that may have heard that was May 1962

258
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
Done by this guy an experiment is being conducted in the elegant interaction laboratory at Yale University

259
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Stanley Milgram talking about the experiment film in case you've never heard of this

260
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Probably happen Katie heaven

261
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
Create a bunch of subject or subjects of 40 males between the ages of 20 and 50 normal everyday dude

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Subjects ranging occupation from Corporation presidents to Good Humor man in plumbers near am through something like

263
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,223
But you and I just would have each subject sit down at a table

264
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
Front of this really impressive looking machine

265
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Machine had lots of switches on it

266
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,327
Any other room there was a guy who he called the learner who is supposed to have memorized some words

267
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,215
Everytime that guy got a word wrong that you just did

268
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
Volunteer was instructed to shock that guy with higher and higher voltage

269
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
The volunteers couldn't see the guy he was shocking

270
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
They definitely run

271
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,111
Yoakum staged the whole thing like it was some experiment about memory and punishment but of course it wasn't about that

272
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Continue play is that how far these people go how many times would they shock that salve

273
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,887
Sap in the Next Room just because they were being told

274
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,751
Guy yelling of course was an actor in the shocks weren't real but

275
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,127
The questions in the air at the time were very real

276
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
This is the moment when human cruelty was on trial

277
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Quite literally

278
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
When I stand before you judges of Israel to appear

279
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
And I knew I met you

280
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
I do not stand alone

281
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
So Stanley Milgram actually begins these experiments

282
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
The same year that I don't like man goes on trial

283
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
For Nazi war crimes

284
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,543
That's radio producer Ben Walker it'll be our guide for the segment and in the trial

285
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
When the prosecutor is essentially

286
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Ask him how you came to

287
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Commit genocide

288
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,247
He would say over and over again

289
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
My personal affair

290
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
I was just

291
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Following order

292
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,903
I had to do what I was ordered

293
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
It's this defense

294
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
This is basically what Stanley Milgram

295
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Set out to test

296
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,887
285 volts in a lab at Yale University with a bunch of regular American

297
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
Like is that something at Universal or just 10

298
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,871
Eichmann think he figured maybe 1% of these men would keep flicking the switches

299
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Up to the highest voltage but

300
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
That's not what he found

301
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
65% were willing

302
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
Shock their fellow citizens over and over again even passed when they were screaming and

303
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
Even when they stop screaming when they were maybe dead

304
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
You won't answer me or nothing

305
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Please continue go on

306
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
They continue talking there

307
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
Corpse

308
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,319
His experiment remains one of the most famous experiments of the 20th century

309
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
1962 Stanley Milgram shock the world with his study on obedience it is still trotted out to explain

310
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
Everything from hazing to war crimes what is there in human nature to gang Behavior

311
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
Allows an individual to act in you mainly genocide it's like a downloadable from the internet

312
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
Instant defense doing wrong but

313
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
If you look at milgram's work Coast

314
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Like this guy did

315
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,343
Alex Haslam professor of psychology at the University of Exeter

316
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
A different picture

317
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Well maybe that story is being told

318
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
A million and one times for the last 50 years we just got to get together now what you need to understand about

319
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Haslam is that he hates it when interviewers

320
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Only want to talk about the Baseline study

321
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
The one that everybody knows the circle Baseline to 65% 1

322
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Want me to talk about

323
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,967
Yeah so there's more actually he studied between 20 and 40

324
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Different variants of the same parody

325
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
Stanley Milgram took electric shocks is very seriously

326
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
He did this experiment a bunch of times and in a bunch of different ways

327
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,583
Change where the Shocker in the shock ESAT

328
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Women participants she had an experimental he wasn't a scientist it was a member of the general public and everything

329
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Scenario produced

330
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
A different

331
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Results

332
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Really yeah

333
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
Let me get me. I'm just in front of me I just got the

334
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Did they see from the middle console images

335
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,343
I mean solganik the Baseline study is the one where 65% of the volunteers go all the way

336
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Highest dose

337
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Text but an experiment number 3

338
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
If they put the Shockey in the same room

339
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
What's the shocker to the Shocker can actually see the person that he's talking about 4

340
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
40% in an experiment number for when the teacher has to hold the Learners hand down on a plate and Order him to feel

341
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
It drops to about 30% wow

342
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
Experiment 14 if the experiment was not a scientist but is an ordinary man not

343
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Wearing white coat constructs to

344
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
20%

345
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:36,767
How low can we go okay here's another one experiment 17

346
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
You and those two other participant both actor

347
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
If Lowe's to participants refused to go on like saying I don't want to kill a guy

348
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Under those circumstances got one experiment 15 experiments who's giving you

349
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Use instructions that he put two experimenters in the room and they start disagreeing with each other at least this one you got

350
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
0% going

351
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,719
0 in that condition you said zero

352
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Not a soul

353
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Exactly 0%

354
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
Well alright I'm starting to feel a little bit better about my fellow man

355
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Hey hey hey

356
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Okay

357
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Where is he

358
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Mom in the closet

359
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Closet cuz this room is echoey

360
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
And you know there's nothing like

361
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
A closet full of clothes to like how

362
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Bounce It Out

363
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:32,319
You see it's just in that one experiment that 65%

364
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,927
People are willing to go all the way but in all of these other scenarios they don't

365
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,511
And even when they do say yes even when they go along with the experiment

366
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
As you can see in the film

367
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Woman

368
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
They struggle continue using the last witch on the board

369
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
No answer

370
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Please continue the next Warriors White

371
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
They have

372
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Debates with themselves

373
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Please

374
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,407
Debates with the experimenter

375
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
Sometimes an experiment requires that we continue

376
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
Whether Lerner likes it or not we might what's interesting is that how all of these struggles all of them

377
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,839
Please continue play out the same way it's the experimenter

378
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Frothing the Shockers along

379
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
450

380
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
For me it's all about the prods

381
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
This is what totally pulled me in

382
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Story

383
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
Ron Stanley Milgram had

384
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
4 script

385
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Prods that he wrote out for his

386
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Experimenter

387
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
When the subject didn't want to continue

388
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
Yep the first one was

389
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Please go on

390
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Continue play

391
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
And if they

392
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
Didn't go on if they resisted

393
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Experimented with breakout Prada number

394
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
The experiment requires that you continue

395
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
ASAP. 195 old Innes they still were resisting or struggling they'd get Prada number three

396
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
It's absolutely essential that you continue

397
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
Absolutely edible but you can't a little bit more direct

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,903
The critical. For the critical. Is an absolute order 4th product is

399
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
You got no other choice

400
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
You have no other choice teacher

401
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
You must continue

402
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
That is definitely in order exactly

403
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,983
But everytime the experimenter pulled out the fourth Broad

404
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,079
And this was confirmed when the experiment was redone in 2006

405
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Total disobedience

406
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Disobedience

407
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,991
Anytime the experimenter said you must continue

408
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
The Shocker would say

409
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
Hell no I don't

410
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
You got no other choice.

411
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
I have a choice I'm not going to go ahead with it

412
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
Well I have to discontinue the experiment that

413
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
I'm sorry

414
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Here's another one

415
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
We have no other choice you must have a choice

416
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
That is if you don't continue what we're going to have to discontinue the

417
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,199
You'll have to eat this cut it out after all he knows what he can stand

418
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
That's my opinion that's where I'm staying on it

419
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
How so

420
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,976
The subject seemed willing to shock another human being but as soon as you say its in order they don't do it

421
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Now that's important is very important because

422
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
If you ask University undergraduates what does the Milgram study show they will invariably say something like they showed the people

423
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
EBay orders

424
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,336
Well actually the one thing that the study really doesn't show is that people obey orders

425
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,968
And it's a pretty big thing to Mississippi

426
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
Do it if it doesn't show the people are

427
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Just

428
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Obeying orders

429
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Yeah and what does it show

430
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Okay I think it looks just like this

431
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
I was going to instructions

432
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
We will begin with

433
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
The participants of Avenue in the study

434
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Which pair of words are very Poolesville very credible hycite is scientist a scientist Institution

435
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,544
Who is going to do this powerful piece of science

436
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
Say sit down in the chair thinking wow

437
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
It's really important

438
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm about to help this quest for knowledge

439
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
I really want to do

440
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
No snow in life lots of things that we do that worthwhile doing and not always easy

441
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
And you find yourself in a situation where you've got to do something that's hot like shocking an innocent stranger over

442
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
If you think that's the right thing

443
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
If you think that song says worth pursuing you say okay I'll go along with this

444
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Seriously near shocking these people because they thought it was

445
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Worthwhile

446
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Bryn Athyn

447
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,480
This won't just blowing the bead and sorrow you tell me so yes sir no sir three bags full set

448
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
Are engaged with a toss that trying to be good

449
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Participate

450
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Are you all right

451
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
But trying to

452
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Do the right thing

453
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
They're not doing something

454
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Because

455
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
They have to

456
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
But doing it because I think they ought to

457
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,400
All the difference in the world

458
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
I want 220 volts

459
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
Something I said I see a darker interpretation the original absolutely darker as they are doing it no question

460
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,272
They have the agency they think it's right on someone will they know it isn't

461
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
Chilling comparison with choose a speech that him like I visited SS some SS leaders

462
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
About to come it's arranged for choices he's me so this is what you're going to do is cause you don't want to do this okay

463
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,680
Cool nobody wants to be killing other people we realize this is hardware

464
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
What you doing is for the good of Germany in this is necessary in order to advance Noble

465
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Cause

466
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
So then anyway I'm almost done

467
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Give me two more minutes

468
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
2 more minutes so in the Milgram case

469
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Haha

470
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
With the idea that people will do bad if they think

471
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
It's good

472
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
The good noble cause what's the noble cause in this case science

473
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
You can see this in the surveys that the men filled out

474
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,888
After the experiments were over exactly what was on my mind at the experiment

475
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
If the experiment had to be successful

476
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Had to be carried on

477
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,824
The questionnaires they filled out are part of the Milgram archives at Yale

478
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
Willing to help and worthwhile experiment

479
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
And it's

480
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,808
Kind of surprising a lot of them are really positive even though they've just been told

481
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
But they were

482
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,904
Duke research in any field is a must

483
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
Herculean this

484
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:34,048
Do you think that more studies of the sword should be carried out definitely yes

485
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,168
We as as up on Lucas to the study we have this going to go to like

486
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
So vision is like what what course what they're doing is wrong

487
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
But if it looks I'm from another person

488
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:50,432
Active there's a sense in which you could celebrate what they doing I mean I'm not suggesting but I'm just saying

489
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,552
These people are prepared to do something that's very painful to them until someone else

490
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Because they want to promote Sons

491
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
You know you can see that's a good thing

492
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,744
I mean cuz it's like we started with this experiment that we all

493
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
See as

494
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Evidence of humans

495
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Latent

496
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Capacity for evil

497
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,448
Yeah tell us a casino under some circumstances we don't do the bad thing weird

498
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Because

499
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:19,872
Your other flip we don't have to be told exactly hate being told but we will do it on our own if we think it's good

500
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,944
Yeah now you're saying actually these could read that

501
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
That very dark

502
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
Fact as being actually evidence of something quite

503
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
What if you dress to happen if you just had some on your parents the Paradigm you could presumably making as make this out these of these are people who own kind

504
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:41,120
Emmys the fact of course at the administering pain to a stranger that's what a horrifying about it but I met you

505
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
Already will I have to administer shocks themselves or something good

506
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,896
Then we say these are people already believe in something isn't this a good thing that we have people in our society

507
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,992
Who are willing to make sacrifices full of great the greater good

508
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,368
Tony and where do you come down do you leave this experiment in a light mood

509
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Or in a dark mood

510
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
We're close to some really fundamental truths about human nature

511
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,192
Onion emojis by human nature as it affords infant potentials for loneliness in dog

512
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592
Lots and lots of lessons and that one is I think you know when you're enjoying to do something for the greater good maybe I'll do some

513
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Question

514
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
What is greater and what is good

515
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,760
Now that right there slap some quotations around that

516
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
I think stupid Walker whose podcast he has a podcast that's a good one it's cold

517
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,960
Too much information yes awesome thank you Ben and also thank you to Alex Haslam professor of psychology at

518
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360

537
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Terms and conditions apply

538
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,592
Ig321 hey I'm Jared I'm run I'm Robert krulwich uses Radiolab and today

539
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Evil

540
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Although

541
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
I don't know if that's the right word

542
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Cuz it said if

543
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,552
Can you call someone you will then you're kind of done with them but there's been a fellow

544
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,160
I've been thinking about him for better part of the year as you felt such a puzzle to me

545
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
I can't

546
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Quite

547
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
Please him though it's very fun to try

548
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
And I heard about him

549
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
From science writer Sam Kean

550
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,936
Fritz Haber so so so could you just like

551
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,008
When did he live and what did he look like in math

552
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
He was

553
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,384
Doing his his great science work right around the

554
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,248
The twentieth century so right around 1900

555
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
Very distinctive-looking man

556
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Bald on top

557
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Trim nice mustache

558
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Wore a little

559
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Business is that how you say it

560
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:24,864
Pince-nez with one of those very tiny old-fashioned pair of glasses that would pinch on your nose

561
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,704
And he was someone who had very big ambitions

562
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Just put that in context

563
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:38,176
I'll bring a few other of our storytellers in Breslau Germany that's Fred Kaufman which is

564
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,504
A fairly small you know the smallest sort of town and

565
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
So does Clara

566
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:49,440
That's right Albers wife-beater later right Clara comes in the same town and they're both secularized Jews this

567
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
The moment in German history says when Jews

568
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:58,400
Had a decent amount of Freedom then this is the difference between Kaiser Wilhelm and of course Hitler's Germany

569
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,240
Dan Charles historian his was the first generation when I Young

570
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:07,104
Jewish boy could truly imagine that he could just be a regular part of that Society

571
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
He could do anything

572
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
And believed it

573
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Fast forward 10 years for toddlers professor

574
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Small University

575
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,648
It's working with chemicals about 1881 of the central issues facing Germany today

576
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Bedtime

577
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Germany

578
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Has a problem

579
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
A big problem

580
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,120
It has enough what they used to call them solar energy, energy from the Sun to grow crops to feed

581
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,424
About 30 million people

582
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,056
However that leaves behind 20 million Germans do you mean they're looking at 20 million people

583
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Going hungry

584
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
That's what we're heading towards

585
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
I'm yet to remember it during the

586
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,712
During the Crimean War in the 1850s

587
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
York Stars

588
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:52,672
So around the turn of the century for German scientists like Hopper this was the d challenge he is he wants to feed he wants

589
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
The feed Germany

590
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
Next you this wasn't just a German thing

591
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,072
A lot of people are beginning to worry that with about a billion and a half

592
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
People on the planet

593
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
The maybe we were maxing out

594
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
The Earth couldn't support this many people

595
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,336
And everyone we know the solution yeah we need a whole lot more of one simple Ella

596
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
Nitrogen nitrogen nitrogen nitrogen they needed more nitrous nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids

597
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
And proteins

598
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:24,416
We stick a seed like weed seed in the ground what are the reasons it grows is because it's sucking up all the night

599
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,512
Nitrogen in the soil make it cell walls without nitrogen

600
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
You don't have life

601
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
Now of course you could find some nitrogen out in the world natural deposits would be like seaweed or

602
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,384
Cow manure or

603
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
Poop valuable and actually two nations in South America went to war literally over bat

604
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
You can say people work

605
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,208
Crazy by the way that's reporter lots of Nasser

606
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,840
Everybody was desperate for sources new sources of nitrogen to make the problems even more annoying

607
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
The most common source of nitrogen is in the air around us

608
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
It makes up

609
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
4

610
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
Out of every five or so molecules

611
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
That we breathe so it's very a lot

612
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
Yes 80% of the air

613
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
Yes nitrogen atoms

614
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
So all the nitrogen you'd ever need

615
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
What's right there you can't like throw that are onto a plant they couldn't.

616
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,560
Deploy it mean they couldn't capture that's right and I'm part of the problem here

617
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,912
And although once again we're getting a little ahead of ourselves we'll be right back The Hobbit way I look

618
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
Is that is that nitrogen is

619
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Trivalent

620
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,104
Triphase prevalent in other words nitrogen

621
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664
Is really strong attachments

622
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,504
To itself what he means is that when nitrogen atoms are

623
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Is free floating in the air they will

624
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Cling to each other

625
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
Distill nitrogen atoms will

626
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,512
Beardslee hold together and it's almost impossible pry them apart his calculations show that it couldn't be done at least not with her

627
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
Tremendous amount of energy

628
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Like

629
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
Yeah yes but you know

630
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Being ambitious

631
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Harbor start stinking

632
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
In order to do this

633
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
We need to R

634
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
Pressure this we need to put it under a lot of

635
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Pressure

636
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,688
So we start experimenting you figured out a way to take a lot of air

637
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
It's filled with these little nitrogen bonds cleaning to each other and pump it with big iron

638
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:36,000
Under extreme extreme pressure at high temperature

639
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,400
Get in there and number chemical reactions and

640
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,032
What happens is that your elbow in the months in nitrogen apartment cell

641
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
And then forcing it to bond with a Hydra

642
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,968
In a new way

643
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
When hydrogen and nitrogen bond together

644
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Thing you get

645
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Is ammonia

646
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
A liquid

647
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
Is captured the nitrogen

648
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Right out of the air

649
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
You literally get

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Adrift

651
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Drip

652
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Drip

653
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Of ammonia

654
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
It is it is

655
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,336
Arguably the most significant

656
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Scientific breakthrough

657
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Of the ball

658
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
Bread from the air was the phrase

659
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
Does Hopper have figured out a way to take nitrogen

660
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
From the air

661
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,856
Put it into the barren ground

662
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Grew wheat

663
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
This has allowed

664
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
The world

665
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
To have 7 billion

666
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
This is what's driving the world towards

667
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
10

668
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
12 by 2050

669
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
Now we're seeing about a hundred million

670
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Cons of synthetic fertilizer

671
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,408
Produced industrial each year

672
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
And that tonniges then moves into our

673
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Food source

674
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
Our food source that moves into our bodies

675
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
And the rough statistics are that

676
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
Half of each of our bodies

677
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Contains nitrogen

678
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
From the haber process

679
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
No she really

680
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
And so in 1918 fitzherbert gets a Nobel Prize

681
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
But this is my

682
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
An interesting guy

683
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Around the same time

684
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Officials in the US.

685
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
Oconomowoc

686
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,112
Alright just back up once

687
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
After hybrid nitrogen

688
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
He was promoted

689
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
You know he takes over the leadership of this institute in Berlin and he starts hobnobbing with a whole different level of society

690
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,216
That stand Charles again mean it's a pretty heady thing for you know Jewish kid from Breslau

691
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
To be

692
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
Hobnobbing with

693
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
The emperor

694
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
And cabinet ministers

695
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
He's part of the club

696
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
A really really relished

697
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,248
And not just cuz he was vain which everyone agrees he was but

698
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Because he loves his country

699
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Did you love the Fatherland and he loves Germany

700
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
So when World War 1 begins signs up immediately sends a letter volunteering for Duty singing

701
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Process that I used to make

702
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Food

703
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,864
Well I can use that same process

704
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,680
Explosives

705
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
Because the thing that you put into the ground to grow more food is also the thing you can explode to make a bomb that's correct

706
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Cause

707
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
It takes such energy and

708
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
Pressure to separate it

709
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:39,552
Trivalent bond is so strong that when it comes back together

710
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
That energy is released

711
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
You could be used

712
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Life

713
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
In any case

714
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,352
Back to World War one trench warfare it gets bogged down

715
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
And harbor has an idea

716
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
It goes straight to the German High command

717
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
Any any pictures

718
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
I danced as well

719
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,592
We can drive those enemy soldiers out of trenches

720
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Gas

721
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Chlorine gas

722
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
The front

723
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
And when the when the wind is right

724
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Will just spraying the generals were not

725
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
All that conventin now they didn't like it

726
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,904
A lot of them are like this is not how you fight a war

727
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,928
Play clean dirty

728
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
Unsportsmanlike

729
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
Organizes

730
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
Soldiers he organizes whole gas

731
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Units in WW2 ask

732
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
Text command of them partially travels to the

733
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Front

734
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,520
And on April 22nd 1915 1915

735
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Hobart finds himself in a little town in Belgium called

736
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,176
Why pressed Americans

737
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,576
Whatever you call it Arenas on the Western Front

738
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
Germans run one side the French the Canadians in the British on the other

739
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,720
And they're behind the German lines is

740
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,840
Rrr friend a frenemy

741
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
He has a potbelly he has these spectacles is chomping on a Virginian cigar

742
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:08,640
He was always smoking cigars and he's wearing the fur coat

743
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,760
But nobody had done what he was about to do on the scale that he

744
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,136
So basically at 6 p.m. on April 22nd

745
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
When the wind was just right here

746
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Hopper's gas troops

747
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
Unscrew they open the valves

748
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
On almost 6000 tanks

749
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
And painting

750
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
150

751
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Flooring

752
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
That's like an adult blue whale of

753
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
Lori just trying to imagine that is that like a

754
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,944
Green Cloud the cloud and then others describe it as just kind of

755
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
15 ft

756
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,320
Wall and hugging the land and it just sort of approach

757
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
And it's moving at about one meter per second

758
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:57,280
According to some accounts has it crept across no-man's-land

759
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
And the grass was

760
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,400
Turning to the color of metal Birds

761
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
Fall from the air

762
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
Within minutes gas reach the Allied side as soon as it did

763
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Soldiers began to convulse they were joking

764
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:23,136
Hundreds of them were falling to the ground but what is a guest doing to them exactly I think what it's doing is it

765
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,536
Breathe it in its irritate your lungs to the extent that they sort of filled up with fluid so quickly that you sort of drowning

766
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
Phlegm yellow mucus

767
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:42,336
Frothing out of their mouth those who could still breathe would turn blue

768
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,176
This is a description of hell

769
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:51,040
Yeah but Harbor saw it as a wonderful success and wished

770
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,136
Wish that the Germans and better prepared to exploit

771
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184
Because he felt like they really could have made

772
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Terrific

773
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Advance

774
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
If they had

775
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Had more confidence

776
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
And

777
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
He is celebrated

778
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
You get promoted to the rank of

779
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
Captain and he goes home for

780
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Today's a hero

781
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
But

782
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
When he gets there

783
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
He has to contend with

784
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
With his wife

785
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Clara immerwahr

786
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Clara also from Breslau off

787
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Also from a Jewish Family

788
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
And also a scientist

789
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,880
Unusually so in those times she was actually a genius herself she was one of the first women

790
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
To earn a

791
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,744
PhD in her country and shortly after his

792
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
Return Clara

793
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
Allegedly confronts him

794
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
And says

795
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
You are morally bankrupt

796
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Could you but hey birb just kind of ignored her and

797
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
According to Legend

798
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,312
He actually threw a dinner party

799
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
In celebration of the big sick

800
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
Invited his friends over

801
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:55,296
We don't actually know if you threw a party but I consider that apocryphal Dan doesn't think so but what's clear

802
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,392
Is it he said no reason to question what you done and that infuriated Clara

803
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
Especially because she found out he was

804
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,256
Leaving the next day to direct more gas attack

805
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,400
And they probably had an argument that's historian Fritz turn to also happens to be for toddlers

806
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Got some they had a

807
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,520
World more than that scholar fight and later that night after party

808
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,568
Hubbard take some sleeping pills

809
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Sleep

810
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
And

811
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
Takes a service revolver it's Havas

812
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
Pistol walks outside to the garden

813
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
And

814
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Pull the trigger

815
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Choose Yourself

816
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
In the chest

817
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
And is found by her son

818
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
By her son

819
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
Yes age

820
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
13 I think

821
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Anything directly

822
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
Still alive

823
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
With a life about to run out of her

824
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Harbor

825
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
It's unknown what happened

826
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
For the rest of the evening but it is

827
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,895
A well-documented fact that the very next morning on schedule he goes back

828
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Leaving a son

829
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Alone

830
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
With this

831
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Dead mother

832
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Cold

833
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Yeah

834
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Heartless

835
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
It was a terrible moment did he run away

836
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Was it Duty the sun eventually

837
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
African immigration to America

838
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
Kill himself

839
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
Seen around this point I just don't want to have anything to do with this guy this is a size want to take a shower

840
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,207
Yahweh

841
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
YouTube

842
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,631
You on the other hand if you look at the Grand calculus people he's

843
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,471
Helter fad versus people he's killed them he's got that billions of people

844
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,823
I don't know that you could entirely call him back I might even till towards

845
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Saying

846
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
He's a little good

847
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,735
To be honest you wouldn't though would you really would you really think that this guy's a good guy

848
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
Honestly yeah just because

849
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
The mathematical summing up

850
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:11,231
We're talking billions of people he's standing there on the front pushing the gas into the lungs other human

851
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
Beings have smelly it's a war but still

852
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
Then he goes in and celebrate

853
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
And then walked away from his child and his wife dead in the garden and his tank more of that please

854
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
Tasteful about

855
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
Factory was too into it

856
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,919
But I do think on some level you have to divorce the man from his deeds and you got to ask

857
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
Is the world better with him or without him

858
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
I think you got to answer it with him

859
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Right

860
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Well

861
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Judy Cohen story

862
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Yeah

863
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
The same what happened to this guy after world

864
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,935
He actually was very humiliated that Germany had lost

865
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,007
And especially humiliated over the fact

866
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:59,359
That they had to pay enormous War reparations to other countries

867
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,711
So he decided he was going to invent a process to

868
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
To pay for these preparation

869
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
By himself

870
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,879
And what he decided to do is go into the ocean into seawater

871
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
Which contains

872
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,327
Very small levels of gold bites you know over the entire ocean there's a lot of

873
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Gold

874
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
Dissolved into the

875
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:26,751
See he's been 5 years in a futile effort to distill gold from the ocean's Waters

876
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Sounds insane

877
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
On the other hand

878
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
He wants to do it he was trying to repeat this masterstroke needless to say he fails it was actually a crushing blow

879
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
Prayer for him and then

880
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Things really take

881
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
1933,

882
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
And Hitler takes over

883
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
And one of the first

884
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Ax

885
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
That

886
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,095
The Nazis do is to basically issue an order that says there shall be no Jews in the civil

887
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
Full service car was Jewish

888
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
Because it served in World War

889
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,495
He technically would be exempt

890
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,311
But 75% of the people who work for him at the Institute

891
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,639
They were Jewish and they would have to be dismissed

892
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
So

893
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,527
He decides to take a stand and says this is intolerable I'm going to resign

894
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,855
He says that he's not he's always been hiring people based on how smart they are

895
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
And not

896
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Who their grandparents were

897
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,487
So he sends a letter to the Ministry of Education resigning

898
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Any leaves Germany

899
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
Telling a friend

900
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
He felt like he'd lost his homeland

901
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
And then

902
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
He starts this

903
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Period of roaming

904
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,751
He eventually goes to England

905
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,079
But in a famous incident one of England's leading scientists

906
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
Refuses to shake his hand

907
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
And he is basically homeless

908
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
At this point

909
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,015
You know he's a man adrift

910
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
Meanwhile

911
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
His health is failing in 1934 he takes a trip to Switzerland to a sanatorium that before

912
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
We can get there

913
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Heart fails

914
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
And he dies

915
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
Now there's a footnote

916
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Siri

917
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Strange

918
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
I got a little

919
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,591
My advice is my dorsal here stood up whenever the end

920
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Right so during World War I

921
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,991
Hobart Institute had developed a formulation

922
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
Of insect

923
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Killing gas called zyklon

924
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Zaycon

925
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,183
Which was originally did the pesticide once again another night.

926
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Compound it was developed in his Institute

927
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
He knew about it

928
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,887
In fact his chemist had given this particular pesticide is smells it was a warning

929
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,447
So the people didn't inadvertently breathe it in

930
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,775
And get sick but after the Nazis takeover is after he died

931
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
They

932
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,871
Reach back to the shelf and they find us as icons

933
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,015
And they asked for to be reformulated to take out the warning smell

934
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
And it becomes zyklon-b

935
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
The Killing gas

936
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
Of the concentration

937
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,583
Did members in Highbridge family died in the concentration camps

938
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,167
Members of his extended family dead certainly friends of his dick

939
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Does something

940
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Deeply deeply

941
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Wounding

942
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Dressing

943
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Upsetting

944
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
It's a thought

945
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
Did you get anything to do

946
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
What's a plan B

947
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
But he did

948
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
The use of it

949
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
It never match

950
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
So

951
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
How do you feel about him now

952
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Because

953
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,759
And I can't help it feel bad.

954
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,831
Despite the chlorine gas like he didn't intend for

955
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
For that.

956
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
He could have never imagined

957
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Battle

958
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
What is part of me

959
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Says you know

960
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Here's a guy who just wanted

961
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
Do everything better than it ever been done

962
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Whether it was

963
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
Feeding

964
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,911
Killing more

965
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Paradox

966
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
But

967
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
He doesn't with a kind of

968
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
Immoral athleticism Noah

969
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,615
Without humility without

970
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
Without a lot of doubt

971
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
It's a crap

972
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
But it's a crafts with crayons

973
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
And to approach with kind of crazy Joy

974
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,135
I don't know I would rather have scientists

975
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,951
Carried out with them as they proceed

976
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
Maybe it's all about doubt in the end

977
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
Thanks to all our great storytellers

978
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,431

Thanks

987
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:21,151
Hey I'm Jared I'm Roberto witches Radiolab and today we're talking about well we're trying to

988
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,223
Think about what goes on in the mind of a bad person

989
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,319
What makes a bad person so bad that he's different from the rest of us

990
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,623
Any kind of agreement with The Hobbit

991
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
Craigslist

992
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
But you know this question around

993
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,047
Different people

994
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,863
And oddly enough we came and got a really interesting take on

995
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Trunature bad news from the sky James

996
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Shapiro

997
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Professor of

998
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
English

999
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
At Columbia you

1000
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
He said to start you want to know about bad

1001
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:54,175
I'll give you back in Titus andronicus there's a character by the name of Aaron the Moor

1002
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,759
Play where Aaron gets up on stage looks at the audience and says

1003
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,831
Let me just tell you the kinds of things I've been up to Reese

1004
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
Set daily energy between two friends

1005
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
Make Poor Man's cattle break their necks

1006
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:13,887
Set fire on Barnes and he Stacks in the night and did the owners question question with the tears

1007
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,679
Oft have I digged up

1008
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
Dead men from their graves

1009
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,055
And set them up like at the difference door

1010
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
Even

1011
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Even when the Sorrows almost were forgot

1012
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
And on the skin is on the bark of trees

1013
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,527
Have win my life with my knife

1014
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
Carved in Roman letters

1015
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,135
Let not your Sorrows die

1016
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
Though I am

1017
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Tilly's bath

1018
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Here's the interesting thing

1019
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
Cody James he's not the baddest

1020
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
In Shakespeare

1021
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
Because ultimately the play offers up a reason

1022
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,311
For his nasty that's the reason why he's telling all the stuff is because

1023
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
He has cut a deal

1024
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
They will spare his son

1025
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
If

1026
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
Key fashion shopping

1027
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
And tell them what they need to know so

1028
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Is a way in which is a touch

1029
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
Spark of you mad

1030
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
Just a little glimmer

1031
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
Pieces

1032
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
That's what people want it

1033
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,487
They wanted someone who is really thrilling me bad but in the end

1034
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,791
Was redeemed of it

1035
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:20,191
Yeah this wasn't just a theater think no cuz if you couldn't afford a ticket for placing all the plays in the 1500 you could always go to

1036
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,239
What public hanging can you go

1037
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
How much the same reason

1038
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
No States if you're convicted male felon

1039
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
You are

1040
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
You know stronger

1041
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
But you're not allowed to hang until you die

1042
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,015
You cut down before then warning this next part's a little graphic

1043
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
Then the Executioner

1044
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Castrates you

1045
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
Cut you open

1046
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,463
And takes out your internal organs and then separate your head witch

1047
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Opposed

1048
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
But even with all that Gore and horribleness

1049
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
There was often a moment

1050
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
The people waited

1051
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,703
Anyway we wait for it still even now we want what Elizabethan Scott

1052
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
At the scaffold

1053
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Which was

1054
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
A confession

1055
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Before the guy is

1056
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
How to shred

1057
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
He's allowed to confess

1058
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,943
You know III Harley you know

1059
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,527
Regret the fact that I kill the young Baden or

1060
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,599
Defame the king whatever it is the expectation is

1061
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,695
Somebody is made to make his peace with his maker before

1062
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
He dies

1063
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
That's what you do

1064
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
That's what Shakespeare did and all his plays

1065
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
I would give all his bad at least one more

1066
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
Where they can be understood

1067
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
Except this one time

1068
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
So will I

1069
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Interrupt

1070
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
He's a soldier he works for a general the general's name is

1071
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Hello

1072
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
You're supposed to be Chums but

1073
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,903
General Othello has no idea that Iago

1074
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,119
So he plans to destroy Othello and we don't exactly know why

1075
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,983
There are hints of reasons like maybe he thinks a fellow sleeping with his wife or not sure

1076
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Weird thing

1077
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
Is it

1078
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
Not to take down a fellow but

1079
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
Everybody

1080
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Lie

1081
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,015
He stirs up hatred between friends

1082
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:15,647
Between lovers even scheme against his own wife this is just somebody who's performing

1083
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
BrainSurge

1084
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Without anesthesia

1085
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Other people

1086
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
He's a master

1087
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,655
And as for why maybe

1088
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,215
A fella was sleeping

1089
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
With Amelia

1090
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,055
But as the play goes on you begin to think that maybe that's

1091
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:38,943
Just another lie eventually Iago convinces a fellow that his wife has been disloyal what she hasn't

1092
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,551
Identity logos and kills his own white

1093
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
Smothering her with a pillow this is Jess

1094
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
At tsunami

1095
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Aviva

1096
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
The past

1097
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
Through the play

1098
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,095
In the very end of the play when

1099
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
And find out what day I go

1100
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
Fellow asked

1101
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Why

1102
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
Why did you do this

1103
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Iago

1104
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
He refuses

1105
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
What

1106
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,759
We fully expect and what everybody on stage at that moment

1107
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
Fully expect

1108
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
From him

1109
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
You know what does he say

1110
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
Demand me nothing

1111
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
What you know

1112
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
From this time forth

1113
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
I never will

1114
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
Speak word

1115
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
I'm not saying a word

1116
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
I'm not going to give you what you were

1117
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
I'm not going to give you

1118
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:47,295
I am not going to help restore the sense that there is a more order to the world

1119
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
Animal Noir

1120
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
What you know

1121
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
You know

1122
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
If this is the singular moment in shakes

1123
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Spirit he gives you a

1124
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,143
An understandably evil

1125
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
No motifs

1126
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
No reason

1127
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Any idea what the hell he was in

1128
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Contending

1129
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
What you know

1130
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
You know

1131
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
Meaning of any idea which was in his mind was he trying to make a commentary

1132
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,839
You know damn it good iago's make you want to shower the middle

1133
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
Sur

1134
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
Thank you to James Shapiro whose most recent book is called

1135
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,775
Contested will

1136
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
You know what

1137
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,199
Yeah well I'm left thinking those like if you could somehow mean that would make believe

1138
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,503
Pizza Hut get a real Yago in the room

1139
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,807
And subject that person to questioning

1140
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,623
Really get the mixer to fess up as to why they did

1141
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
Would that make a difference

1142
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,255
We should say that this next section of the program has some references with your

1143
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
Extremely graphic and not to everybody

1144
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Kids

1145
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
In the room maybe this is

1146
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
Come to go faster

1147
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Yeah

1148
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
It comes to us from

1149
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
Text me to

1150
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,407
Alright so who is this guy Bergeron

1151
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,783
Jeff Jensen and he's a reporter in LA and he wrote this graphic novel that I write about

1152
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,831
One of the most prolific serial killers

1153
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
In USA

1154
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Gary Leon Ridgway

1155
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:34,047
The Green River Killer the first victims of the Green River Killer were found in the summer of 1982

1156
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:40,447
Terrorize Seattle in the 1980s in Seattle today a man called The Green River Killer Ridgway murdered at least

1157
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,847
49 women suspected that it could be upwards of 75

1158
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:53,247
Making him the most prolific serial killer in American history all the victims were prostitutes he buried them or

1159
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:59,647
Is there bodies in these little clumps in the woods

1160
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:06,047
And in January of 1984 the Green River task force was formed and my father was recruited the task

1161
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:12,447
Jeff wrote this book because his father Tom Johnson was one of the lead detectives tracking Gary Ridgway

1162
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,847
He ultimately spent 17 years searching for this man in December of 2001 my father and his colleagues

1163
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
Make the arrest DNA testing match them to the crime they arrest Gary Leon Ridgway and

1164
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,551
On June 13th 2003

1165
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,159
Gary was secretly taken out of his jail cell and brought to

1166
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,207
Is there a very nondescript

1167
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,559
Concrete ugly office building

1168
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,863
And over the next 6 months

1169
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
From June to early December

1170
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Who is Thomas job to get Gary to open up and give up the few details that they really needed to link him sir

1171
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Probably all these crime

1172
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,991
Today's date is June 17th

1173
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:00,319
Your 2003 the time now is early 36 hours

1174
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,647
So every day they would bring them into this conference room

1175
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,951
Nutrition of an interview with Gary

1176
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Take me on Ridgeway

1177
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
An interrogator

1178
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,119
Remember since we last talked

1179
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,495
I got those all at night mostly

1180
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
But remember

1181
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
Picking her up at

1182
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,223
It immediately became apparent that there was going to be difficulties

1183
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:35,135
Things you would obscure he would dance around things he didn't really want

1184
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
To everything that he

1185
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
I got to tell you

1186
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
I'm not

1187
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
Only comfortable

1188
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
That you're providing all the information

1189
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Especially

1190
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
When it came to one particular fact

1191
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,983
What my father and his colleagues know

1192
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Is that

1193
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,055
Something was done to these body many of

1194
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
After they were

1195
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,151
Deceive is he saying what I think he's saying

1196
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
Necrophilia

1197
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Gary is dancing around this time

1198
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,575
Gary had denied this to his own lawyer

1199
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
So

1200
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,903
My father

1201
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,231
And the other interviewer in that room that morning detective John Matson

1202
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
They start

1203
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Are you using

1204
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:18,655
Illini attactive of interviewing him that was very

1205
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,495
Stunningly

1206
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
Shockingly empathetic

1207
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
Thousands people.

1208
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
Not the first one

1209
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,247
You know you're not the first person as ever done this

1210
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
Could be the last

1211
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
You won't be the last

1212
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
That's one of the things

1213
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
We need to know

1214
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,439
Fathers trying to like a reach out to him

1215
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,487
I know it was more than

1216
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
It's okay to admit it

1217
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
You need with me

1218
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
It's all right

1219
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
It's one of the things

1220
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,703
Afternoon

1221
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
And

1222
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
Oh yes I did lie about that

1223
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
I went back one time before 9, so that I

1224
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:14,463
Like I said

1225
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
This is a major breakthrough

1226
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
So handsome

1227
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,863
In graphic detail

1228
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,263
And it gets even more disturbing for my father as the conversation suddenly pivots to another victim

1229
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
1

1230
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
No close to me

1231
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,431
By the name of Carol Christensen

1232
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,015
3 * 2 *

1233
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,831
Rings represent example of a of a woman that

1234
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,903
He actually had strong feelings for

1235
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
You like to see

1236
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,863
As it happens my father has very Vivid memories of investigate

1237
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,143
Eating the Carol Christensen

1238
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,935
Speaking with Carol's mom

1239
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
Carol's little daughter

1240
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,519
Kill her she was

1241
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
I knew she had a

1242
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Daughter

1243
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
And so

1244
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,175
Alaska Gary starts going through this narrative

1245
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
What he did

1246
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Carol

1247
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,295
The last time she was

1248
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
In a hurry

1249
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,903
She like was allegedly in a rush

1250
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
And like it kind of like

1251
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Hurt his feelings

1252
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
When says bye meme

1253
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
Make me mad

1254
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,351
Very much in a hurry

1255
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
Remind

1256
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Killer

1257
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
A choker

1258
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,871
With my alarm

1259
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
And

1260
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
Play killer cared for me before bed

1261
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
Up until that point

1262
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
Gary refuse to say

1263
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
That from the minute I pick these women up

1264
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
I wanted to kill them

1265
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
He claimed

1266
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
They're in the middle of a sex act

1267
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
Distracted

1268
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
Something would happen

1269
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
I need a kind of went crazy

1270
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Kids snack

1271
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Almost like blaming the victim

1272
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
And my father

1273
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
Wasn't buying

1274
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Backups

1275
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Russell Becker

1276
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,895
But the fact that he kept on doing it over

1277
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
Over and over again was like come on

1278
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
Been through this

1279
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
What time is before in

1280
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
I already told you

1281
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
You knew what was going to happen

1282
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
Done this how many times

1283
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,975
And I'm 10 15 20 times

1284
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
You know what's going to happen

1285
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
Like

1286
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,703
If you go in this

1287
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,031
Knowing full well that could end up in her death

1288
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
And Gary just

1289
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
Yes

1290
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
That is true

1291
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
I when I pick them up

1292
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
I was

1293
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
Finally acknowledged

1294
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Yeah

1295
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
There's a possum

1296
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,623
My father just says

1297
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Why

1298
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,023
Why did you do this

1299
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,143
And that was a question that haunted my father

1300
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Protect

1301
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,311
Why in that wine that one simple why that he a scary there was a lot of questions you would ask

1302
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
Why did you inflict all this suffering on them on us why did you take these women off the streets and wanted to

1303
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,039
Sweet wine

1304
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
And

1305
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
The answer

1306
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Is

1307
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Unsatisfied

1308
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
Yes I didn't need to kill killer because

1309
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Wait what

1310
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,335
I just need

1311
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Because of

1312
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,919
Then he just

1313
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Trails off

1314
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
To kill because of

1315
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
That's it

1316
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Did you know

1317
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
Want to kill him

1318
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
I just needed to kill them

1319
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
In that moment

1320
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
My father

1321
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
He stands up and he says

1322
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Text me

1323
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,095
You touched me Gary

1324
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
Touch me

1325
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727
We're going off to eat now

1326
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,799
Turn on 24 hours

1327
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
On June 17th year 2003

1328
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
He walked out of the room

1329
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
And just started

1330
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,807
They spent the next six months

1331
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:30,207
Interrogating him they brought in psychiatrists in forensic psychologists to try to get an answer Gary's

1332
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:36,607
Because I needed to kill a Niger why and he says because of the rage and we'll why the rage and because women have stepped on me all my life

1333
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,447
Well why can't you deal with it and then normal way each answer

1334
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Just beg

1335
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Another why

1336
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,823
And even though in the end they got him to confess to these 49

1337
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Murders

1338
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,407
They never really get any closer to an answer

1339
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Then this first one

1340
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
That afternoon

1341
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
He gets in his car

1342
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Goes home

1343
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
Vines my mom

1344
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
On

1345
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
The deck

1346
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Sits down

1347
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,231
Next to her

1348
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
She says

1349
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
What happened today

1350
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
My dad's

1351
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
And to this day there

1352
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
If not talked about that day

1353
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
And he hasn't talked about it

1354
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,519
With anyone

1355
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Until

1356
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,823
I interviewed him

1357
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
For the buck

1358
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
Why is it

1359
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
So important you think

1360
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
The understand

1361
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Why

1362
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
Behind

1363
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Such an evil eye

1364
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:35,487
Haunts me about the why question is that I'm reminded of like one of the oldest stories in the Bible

1365
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
Stream Joe

1366
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
The story of Jobe is that one day

1367
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,351
Don Satan

1368
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
We're having a conversation

1369
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
And they're saying

1370
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
Have you checked out Jobe

1371
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,567
You know I'm really proud of Joe he believes in me and you trust me and so much

1372
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,359
He has such great faith

1373
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,943
And Satan is like my I bet I can change his mind

1374
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
Associating basically

1375
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
Systematically

1376
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,807
Destroys job's life

1377
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:06,463
Takes away his wife is children all his material possessions what follows but this ongoing conversation between Joe

1378
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
Open his friends about

1379
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
Why does this

1380
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
Why does God allow this to happen

1381
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,631
Only then

1382
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,191
Does God speak up and kind of say

1383
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,031
Like you're going to question me like you no more you

1384
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
My point is

1385
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Sometimes

1386
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
When we ask

1387
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Hawaii

1388
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,479
In the face of profound evil

1389
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
I kind of wonder

1390
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
If what we're doing

1391
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
Is that weird earring guy

1392
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
And I think what we want out of the Y

1393
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
Why is

1394
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
Meaning

1395
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
Meaning to life

1396
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
To reveal itself

1397
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
In a way that restores

1398
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,071
Ordering gives

1399
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Is Hope.

1400
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,631
All of this isn't just

1401
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Meaningless

1402
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:49,887
