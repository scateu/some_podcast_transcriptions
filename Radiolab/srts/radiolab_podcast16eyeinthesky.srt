1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,264
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,128
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
So how did you guys ever find out about

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
How to get into it

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
I think it was somebody was reading about it

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
This is manoush zomorodi

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Was we are we with you reading about it right

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,976
MSR producer Alex goldmark

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
His name is McNutt

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
Name at least

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
And dimes please

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
Like we actually read it and it was

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
Weird and interesting and brought up

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Lots

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,152
Technology is remaking what is possible for individuals

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
And for institutions and for the international order

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Young Jedi runtime Roberto which is Radiolab so here we are at this moment in time where we at we are face

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Faced with these decisions

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
About what we want our future to

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
To look like

22
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:09,632
There are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
That place is

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
A special obligation on us to ask tough question

25
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
About what we

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Should

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
With our friends down the hall manoush zomorodi and Alex goldmark there on a grape podcast

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Note to self pay will be our guides

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Into the world

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
Of McNutt yes my name is Ross McNutt

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Sub McNutt

32
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
As I refer to him

33
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,512
He's an ex-military guy 20 years in the Air Force I enjoyed it

34
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
I did a lot of good like combat military

35
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Yah mean

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
I think he's actually special

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
My background I've got a PhD in Rapid product development out of MIT

38
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,080
And what I do is I teach young people how to build new systems

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,248
And the new system that's a system that we want to talk about that kind of began in 2004

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
Ross was teaching a course at a Military College

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,672
Was that the Air Force Institute of Technology here in Wright-Patterson in Dayton

42
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
Does one day in 2004

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Are the whole school gathered together

44
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Pharrell

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,888
And our commander got up in front of the whole school and said we need to do something to help

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
The war effort

47
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Terrible violence today in the city of Basra at that time in the Iraq War

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
You're not going well suicide

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
IEDs going off

50
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
All over the place is going off everywhere soldiers being blown up

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Weak I got blown up

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Recon

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
And to be honest with you in 2004 it looks like we're going to lose

54
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
Psoriasis he gets together some of the students some of his colleagues and they decide Lena let's sit down and see if we can find

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Find a solution quickly find a solution

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
To figuring out who is planting all these roadside bomb

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Yeah

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Bombs going off of pretty easy to detect

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
And images

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
The problem is

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
How do you go from

62
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
Bomb going off backwards in time

63
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
To be able to figure out who planted it

64
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
So

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Somehow

66
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
It just came out

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Are you guys sitting around

68
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
It was at a bar

69
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
We're working on the back of the napkin

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
And withdrawing out different ideas and turning around and seeing what happens

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
They're just like hey let's he's playing just try this let's try that

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
They had this one stock and we sort of

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Through this out on the back of an MBA

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Making it

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Took a little while

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
38 students working

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Confirm me for 2 years

78
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
But eventually they developed what became known as

79
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
Project Angel Fire

80
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
You're at work to take a small plane and on the belly

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,888
The plane they hook up his array of cameras

82
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Start the camera system we design and build

83
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Super hayat

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,312
Men the pilot

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Takes off

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Flies the plane High over Fallujah

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
Military we were up at about 15 to 16 thousand feet to stay out of the Missile Range

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
On the ground in Fallujah and I look up what would I say

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
You wouldn't see us

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
You wouldn't hear us or you wouldn't see us

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Over Fallujah circle circle circle

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Click

93
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Click

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,527
Click every second takes a still image of the entire city of Fallujah 25 square miles

95
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
And then teams it down to an operator we take a picture

96
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Processing Down Lincoln

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
Process it Down Lincoln

98
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Every single second

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,863
To the plaintiff snapping picture after picture after picture which cures what makes the system so powerful

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
The operator on the ground has what say an entire day's worth

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
Of the high-res pictures of the entire city of Fallujah

102
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
And let's say there's an explosion at least 20 people were killed in explosions on the market

103
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
11 others

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,783
First the operator would pull up the most current image of the city

105
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
Zoom into the place with in Fallujah where it happened

106
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
And then click

107
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Click click

108
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
In one second increments go back in time

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,839
And see who was there what happened the last time somebody fiddled around in that

110
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah you like okay I might have gone back to ours and

111
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
It's bad car

112
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Fast forward

113
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
Click the canal follow that car forward

114
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
In time

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
To see where it goes

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
You see that it went to

117
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
House in another neighborhood 2 miles away

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Well that's where you dispatcher troops to write that

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,391
Basically we be able to send either the Special Forces then I the Marines in

120
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Intuitive

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Take appropriate action

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
It's not like they release a lot of

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Think about how well their

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Technology has work

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
But you will find several quotes from office

126
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Saying that yes

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Project Angel Fire disc

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Save lives

129
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
But the reason why we decided to do the story is because it's not just a military thing right like with a lot of

130
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
These Technologies they may be stored in the military

131
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
But then they trickled down all the way down

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
To all of us

133
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Actually in this case trickle-down

134
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
To Dayton Ohio

135
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
Ross Group Incorporated

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,287
Yabby weird producer and emails and I actually went to Dayton Ohio

137
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
To visit Ross

138
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
At his best

139
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,967
Persistent surveillance systems persistent surveillance

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Write that essay

141
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Orwellian

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,391
These are the lenses and the motors here basically control it

143
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,767
So first we went over to his Workshop where he actually works and makes the camera

144
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,351
These are more powerful than some of the best military systems

145
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
Like we could see him actually making them and how they get attached to the bottom

146
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
The airplane

147
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,359
Oh so many airplanes then we went over to the hangar where he has all the airplanes

148
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
Beautiful Dover all we got 27 airplane

149
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Africa

150
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Oh my God it's big and then he showed us their Command Center

151
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,391
And this is where you have a bunch of people sitting in front of these enormous screen

152
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
This is like your viewing room

153
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Yeah and this is where all the

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
Plane pictures end up

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Because Ross is basic idea and taking this technology from Fallujah to a city like Dayton Ohio

156
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,591
Basically this is just as large a problem as we doing

157
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
Afghanistan and Iraq only it's not IEDs it's crying

158
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
We've had a lot of major events this year we've had four officer-involved shooting so far this year our homicides are up this

159
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,927
Here to this is Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl

160
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
I talked to him last summer

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Couple years ago

162
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Ross call them up

163
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,375
Was like look a city like Dayton Ohio we've got 28,000 crimes a year

164
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
About ten thousand part 1

165
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Murder rape

166
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Salt 10000 part 1 crime

167
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
Comes out to be 480 million dollars

168
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
A year but McKnight is like for the about the price of a police helicopter we believe that we would be able to decrease

169
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Crime by 30 to 40

170
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Percent

171
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,599
30% decrease in that is 155 million.

172
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,975
The Dayton Police were like

173
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Basically setup

174
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
The test

175
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
In June of 20

176
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
12 for a five-day flight

177
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Hip Hop

178
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
This see for ourselves

179
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
What it was capable of doing

180
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Isn't the plane up in the air

181
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Started doing its thing

182
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Buju

183
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
And within just a few hours

184
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
There is a

185
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Call of this a breaking entering a

186
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
In progress with the description of an irregular random moving

187
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
This is Angie horn

188
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
She's the one who called 911

189
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Almanor lunch break

190
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
And she see the moving van

191
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Pull up in front of her neighbor's house

192
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Guy gets outbreaks in

193
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Start smoothie

194
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,847
You know we immediately called the police and they got their relatively quickly from what I remember

195
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
He had already taken off

196
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
Now normally in a case like this the police would be like

197
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Well how do we follow

198
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
We don't know where he went

199
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
But this case

200
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
The police contact persistent surveillance systems and ultimately

201
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
James Alex blasingame I'm the senior analyst for the company

202
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
We're about 5 minutes until he sees this little grainy white. Appear in front of her neighbor's house

203
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
Is the vehicle here that we're wanting to track what vehicle I don't I barely see anything so the image looks blurry

204
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,783
But the human brain in the human eyes are very very evolved to pick out movie

205
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
You gotta understand that from two miles up a car looks just like a random shape

206
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
People they look like

207
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Alex has trained himself to

208
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Pick out Lube

209
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,351
Going to put a tag down and where he's at places in Orange Circle over that random little shape

210
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,471
And then quickly quickly moves forward forward forward follow him to his real time location

211
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,615
Alex follows it up some roads finds out that it is parked in a parking lot six blocks away because up the people on the field

212
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
Does go over there they get there they see the guy

213
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Is your truck full of stuff

214
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
They send different cap over to pick up the witness

215
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Yep that's the guy

216
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Yeah this is minutes later

217
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
No kidding

218
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
That Could Have Been a Murder

219
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
I could have been armed robber

220
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
It could have been a lot of

221
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,263
This is so weird is like having a superpower but it is actually better than Batman you can't go back for the

222
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Timeshares

223
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Superhero

224
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
I just feel sad

225
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
It's like

226
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
We're all just he's little.

227
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
It just seems like the antithesis of what a lot of

228
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
Police Department seem to be trying to do in the aftermath of

229
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Staten Island

230
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Other

231
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Horrific things

232
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
That have happened

233
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Which is getting the police

234
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
On the sea

235
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Making personal connections

236
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Creating relationship

237
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
There's nothing in this system

238
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
That prevents you from having affect

239
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
The community policing

240
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Battle by the way this may dramatically help

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
That community relations

242
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
The reason they're putting body cams on

243
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,551
Fun police officers is try to get the police officers

244
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
More respect

245
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Old because they

246
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Well this lets us watch all the off

247
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
25 ski

248
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Malaria

249
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
But then you can watch so many other people

250
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
Here's other things that people in Dayton do

251
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
Like Romeo and Juliet they sometimes meet without the

252
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Their parents permission

253
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
In the playground

254
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Smooch

255
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,663
There are going to be divorce lawyers who going to be tracking Aaron spouses

256
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Is there going to be traffic police work

257
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,087
Watching who goes through the red light there going to be Realtors were wondering who are how many tenants do

258
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
You really have in that building and I guess

259
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
This thought might beat it

260
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
If the information exists

261
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,863
That will show what my pixel was actually doing then

262
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
Then I'm a little less

263
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Free

264
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
There is a

265
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
A clear trade off

266
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Between

267
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Security price

268
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
And

269
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
You know in our major cities where we have

270
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Tens of thousands of Major Crimes

271
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
You are a lot less free when you can't leave your

272
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
House at night

273
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
Is obviously a

274
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Huge advantage

275
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
To knowing what you know

276
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
But then there's a huge

277
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Sing

278
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
To knowing what you

279
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
Acknowledge all by itself is sort of

280
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Is pregnant with

281
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Funny

282
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
You know what here's my problem with with

283
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Was it all of these private

284
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
It's like when you talk about these technology

285
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
The advantages are always so concrete

286
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
And the trade-offs

287
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
Always feel so abstract

288
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,063
I feel like there is there certain there's something being lost here but I can never quite put my finger on

289
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Twitter

290
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Oh Dad that weirdness that you're feeling

291
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
It's

292
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Can I get

293
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
A lot weirder

294
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

301
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,071
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

302
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

303
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about

304
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Kids you know did something

305
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,039
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

306
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:20,159
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

307
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

308
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,935
Maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

309
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
We're interested in the

310
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Specific moments where

311
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,871
A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

312
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
If you have a story please share it with us

313
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,079
AM General Murad I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and

318
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,919
Continue our collaboration with manouse emirati and Alex goldmark from Note 2

319
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Self and my septic is and remains

320
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Eyes

321
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
In the sky

322
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,159
In the situation we left it is at mnuchin one of our producers and emails have gone down to Dayton Ohio to talk with Ross McNutt

323
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Check out his technology

324
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
How are you feeling

325
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
I was feeling like

326
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
You have not convinced me I do I am not

327
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Gone for this

328
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
And then I saw was my

329
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
And that

330
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Well

331
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
I mean that's what made me start to think otherwise

332
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
Where is especially the time we did this the average

333
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
300 murders a month

334
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
52 kidnappings a week 300 murders a month

335
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Yeah

336
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,927
McNutt the gang they got a contract we've been asked not to say

337
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
For whom

338
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
And they went down south set themselves up in a hotel room got the plane up in the sky and then whoever the client was started

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Bringing them crime reports

340
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,031
So this is kind of what you never want to see happen but this is kind of why the system was up

341
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
Alex pulled up on the screen is very grainy aerial shot

342
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Avoir as This Is War

343
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,503
It looks like any city right you've got like grids of streets

344
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Cars and houses

345
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Like over on the left of the screen

346
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
Key points to the start little square it's a vehicle

347
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
It's going down the street

348
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,303
This is a female police officer she was actually headed to work

349
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
On this morning

350
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,775
All kind of go through it here there's her house

351
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Her car is parked outside

352
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,919
You see that like little pixel gets in her car

353
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
She pulls out of her driveway that was her home

354
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Start to drive to work

355
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
And then right when

356
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
She leaves

357
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
If you look up

358
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Here points to the upper left

359
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Several cars were parked

360
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
Up on the corner

361
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Soon as she left her driveway those cars

362
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
Become active

363
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
So this is a Stakeout

364
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
Yeah they were waiting for her to leave

365
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
He's so zoomed in

366
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
That you can see it's like a Tic Tac moving down the street

367
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
And then two more Tic Tacs come alongside

368
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Until they get right about

369
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
I hear clicking forward on the photo and you see these cars just inch closer

370
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Kind of hesitate there which is

371
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Unfortunate

372
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
So she's driving down the street and Thursdays

373
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
Is cars following behind her

374
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
And then

375
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
There's this car up ahead of her

376
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
A vehicle that had been parked here for

377
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
15 20 30 minutes all the sudden

378
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
Backs out into traffic

379
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
And seemingly slows them down almost gets in an accident right here

380
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Which gives these guys

381
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
Enough time

382
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Ketchup

383
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Is where there go

384
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Pull up beside her

385
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
And then suddenly

386
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Alex says

387
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Right there this is the point

388
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
Where are the first car pulls up and shoots her mouth

389
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
Whole time she was shot in the head multiple times in the head right here

390
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
She's actually going to roll through the intersection

391
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,663
Her car continues to go even though she's been

392
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Gunshot in the head

393
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
There's a park

394
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Car behind the tree

395
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
And you'll actually see this parked car move

396
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
When she runs in

397
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
And then these guys

398
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Takeoff

399
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
It was

400
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Not fun to watch

401
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
But

402
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
What happens next

403
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,311
Made me really start to understand what this technology is

404
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Real quickly just

405
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,943
Show you some of the other takes that moment

406
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,343
Horrible moment and then he starts to like shoot back and forth in time

407
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
Bad before the murder hears his path after the murders actually takes the two cars from that murder and you see

408
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
He draws on the map you see that they meet up with two other cards that were involved in a different word

409
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,983
One murder becomes two two cars become 4.

410
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,847
And if you follow all four of these cars drawing lines as they move through the city

411
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
You find out who they meet up with four becomes KAIT8 becomes so on and so on and you have all the

412
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,111
These lines crisscrossing the city and then you see that a whole bunch of those card

413
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Are headed to one place

414
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
This house

415
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
This house appears to be there cartel headquarter

416
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
And

417
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
That's when you start to think

418
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Oh that's how you have to take something

419
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Like this down

420
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,055
It's not a One-Shot thing like solving the crime

421
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,871
It's about cracking an entire system

422
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
In fact

423
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
This is Andy Harris

424
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
When I was doing some

425
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
Some background research on this part of the story

426
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
I spoke

427
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
This one

428
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Source from the US government who told me

429
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
That

430
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
This information that roster

431
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Did you showed us

432
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
It was one of the primary tools

433
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Used to dismantle

434
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
An entire cartel Juarez in that

435
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Apparently

436
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
The leader of that cartel

437
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Was responsible

438
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
Something like

439
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
1500

440
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Murders

441
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Cigarettes

442
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Cigarettes again so how are you feeling at this point

443
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Happier

444
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Scared

445
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Feel ashamed of myself

446
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
Because I thought all the reason why I'm so excited about it is

447
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Because it's in a country

448
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
I don't live

449
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
And I'm an outsider and I think of it as being met

450
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Stop

451
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,471
So it's okay for them but it's still not okay for us

452
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
What did you think Andy

453
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
I mean

454
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Like this is where I

455
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
Stop being a good journalist because I picked a side

456
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
It feels wrong

457
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
Cannot solve these crimes

458
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Things that we can solve

459
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
And what is his plan is on top of New York

460
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Good

461
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
God really

462
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
From me it became

463
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Could you remember like after 9/11 when you'd walk down the street and you hear the F-16 circling over the city

464
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,240
I just remember the feeling in my stomach was like nausea like I felt

465
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
Stick it felt

466
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
Grossed it felt like we had no autonomy over ourselves and at that point I was scared enough that I could live with it but right now

467
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Now I don't feel that way

468
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
And

469
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
Look at it's a very privileged position to be able to say that we

470
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Shouldn't have it

471
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
I get that

472
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
I've became a convert

473
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Because

474
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Somebody got kidnapped

475
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,608
And if we had an eye in the sky we might be able to get the kids back in a few

476
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Minutes hours

477
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,240
Compared to like you see the stats on Amber Alerts they're not good

478
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,848
What we're talking about is like and I'm not saying that I'm like anti McNutt

479
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Not at all but what I'm saying is like

480
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
It's very easy to paint it as

481
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
We're going to get bad guys and I just don't think it's that

482
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
McNutt & Co they seem like decent people they have set limitations for themselves they have said they

483
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,512
I will not use photography that could get any closer they've made a moral choice

484
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
With that how do we know other people will make the same moral choice

485
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Even though this thing might solve

486
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
A ton of crimes

487
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Might save lives

488
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
It's still not worth the risk

489
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Because

490
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
It just asks

491
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Level up

492
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Of trust

493
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
In government

494
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
That we shouldn't

495
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
We shouldn't get

496
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Is that what you're saying

497
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
For now yes

498
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
So

499
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
Back to dating what would happen in Dayton

500
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Well I was pretty impressed

501
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
That was pretty impressed

502
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
After that five-day demo the

503
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Police chief Richard Biehl

504
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
I recommended

505
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
That we

506
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
Enter into a contract

507
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
What is valency

508
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
And so

509
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
They took it to the city Commission

510
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Alison Carey Gregg New York

511
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
According to Carrie gray director of the city Commission office

512
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
For the city of Dayton Ohio city commission was interested in the in the presentation

513
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
But they decided that before they go forward they should have a public forum

514
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
So they could just

515
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Hear from the people

516
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,048
There was about 75 or so people there and he says that the people of Dayton

517
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
People of Radiolab a note to self

518
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
I'm very divided

519
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
A quarter

520
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Of the people

521
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Where

522
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Supportive of this technology and they were

523
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:45,152
Frustrated with the amount of crime their belief was I'm not doing anything wrong so I don't care what

524
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
People see me doing

525
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
We want this implemented and we want it implemented very broadly Bring It On they were basically in the

526
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Then there was another group

527
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,072
Slightly smaller but not my mind maybe 15% believed

528
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
This was a grotesque

529
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,960
Invasion of privacy and some of the people spoke in

530
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Very impassioned

531
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Terms

532
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
So yay

533
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
I think they calling it grotesque invasion of privacy would pretty much reflect the weight and the way this group was feeling

534
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,552
Proved him and that there was no way that you could trust government

535
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,136
With this volume of information and this breath of information

536
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
So you had your Pros in your cons

537
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:35,328
The rest of the people like the majority maybe had some feelings one way or another but just didn't have enough information

538
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
And so they came and kind of

539
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Eye mask

540
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Questions

541
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
Like how long will persistent surveillance systems keep the images

542
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
90 days

543
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
How far can the zoom in can they see my face

544
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
Know something it'll ask questions

545
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
Which carry seems to think that they could have answered they could have gotten everybody on board

546
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
But in the end

547
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Even though the room was basically divided into

548
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
The three parts

549
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,440
The naysayers were so loud and so impassioned

550
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
That these would have defined the

551
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,352
As we do so we took that lesson to understand that

552
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
There was going to be

553
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
Some significant

554
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
Education that was going to be needed and some significant hurdles that we're going to have to be crossed

555
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,640
Before that we were able to do a broad-based implementation

556
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
And

557
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Based on the amount of time

558
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
What's going to have to be spent

559
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
We decided there were other more immediate techniques that could be used it could be invested in and we took the money

560
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
That could have been spent on this

561
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
And spend it on some other activities

562
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
It seems like what you're saying is it like

563
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,120
It was just going to be too hard to get people of the hurdle so I guess it's not worth it

564
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Yeah

565
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,728
I think that's probably probably accurate So the plan is off

566
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Table saw

567
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
It's off the table for right now

568
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,176
But that doesn't mean that it's never coming back on the

569
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
I think it's fair to say

570
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
Frustrating to him

571
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
Right now we've got about a hundred and fifty million dollars for the proposal sitting out there for a large number of cities Baltimore

572
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Moscow weekend

573
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
There were waiting for them to me

574
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
We've done Compton and Jerome Compton psych maybe like maybe dating is like maybe

575
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
Whole lot of babies out there

576
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
They're analyzing as we are looking at a

577
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,856
Turnpike or something yet traffic in New Jersey

578
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Understanding traffic

579
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,744
We look at congested areas which are typically especially in that part of the country

580
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,632
Exits and on-ramps any kind of Junction in a highway sometimes you just want to scream

581
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
I think that might be 10 times

582
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:03,296
Thank you and thank you

Fiction when Orwell wrote 1984
