1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you at your looks

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radiolab WNYC

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Alright here's a good one

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
At his

5
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
This guy is murder conviction overturned

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
He shot and killed somebody

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,512
Violence right ends up not being a crime

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,072
But he took some of his life

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
With a gun

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Heat his position

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab and we're going to start off today with a conversation that happened in a conference room

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Somewhere in Ohio

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Let's see so just how I got to clean comes to us

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,880
I reported Molly Webster September we were looking around for stories

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
For something one of our challenges like bears are bad news breaking things and so

16
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
I don't know if I've ever mentioned it but I'm from Ohio

17
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
And so I thought I'll pull the Ohio card right now I'm going to look at this online

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
News site cleveland.com

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,480
But there's nothing in the story that is like

20
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
I mean yeah it says he shot someone but he did shoot someone

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,952
I think I saw a headline on their homepage about

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
The right to be forgotten

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
So

24
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
The information about the case

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Is Preserve

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
It's just when you search his name

27
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
It doesn't come up

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,824
Wait time at this is a room full of people trying to figure out if someone has the right to be forgotten

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
I didn't actually know so I just

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,016
Email the guy hello written about the experiment with Chris

31
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Chris Quinn

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
I am the editor of cleveland.com basically the head honcho I started at the plain dealer in 1990s

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,584
As a reporter Chris's story is he started out at the print newspaper the Cleveland Plain Dealer

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,704
And he did he was a reporter. He did that for about five years and he moved on to

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Become an editor in 2013 that created an entirely new Newsroom that they asked me

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Me too

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Weed

38
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,760
The he basically became the editor-in-chief of their online paper cleveland.com

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:35,904
And what we really were trying to do was figure out what kind of content does the digital audience want

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,512
Once he moved online was like the audience was different the format was different this

41
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
Feed which they had to put up stories was different now but there was one part of the online price

42
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Kind of stuck out to him

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
And it had to do with time and memories actually it began I think

44
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
I was in 2014 when I first wrote about it

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,808
Back in the day if you did something stupid got arrested and ended up in the paper

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
As it was for decades

47
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
It is printed in the paper

48
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
People would read it in the morning and then they throw it out drops out of sight it's not easy to find me nurse

49
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Some newspapers that

50
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,240
They kept indexes that would be at the library but even with those you have to go to the library know there was an index

51
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Look up a person's name and get to it

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
If someone really wanted to find it

53
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
They probably have to spend hours or days just

54
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
Rolling through microfiche slides

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
To finally

56
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Navy

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Discover that thing about you from your past

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
And now that everything is online it's

59
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
There

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
Always and forever so if you're going on a date

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
It's bear

62
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
If you're going for job

63
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
It's there

64
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Just

65
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
Never goes away right up front

66
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Forever so is cleveland.com started putting up all these stories about you know people driving drunk or vandalizing property

67
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Streaking across the football field

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Chris started getting these emails

69
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
I am requesting that my name be removed

70
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
From the January 3rd Quest from people

71
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
To take down stories about them a big mistake hold up to it and paid for

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
Order situation has had a horrific effect on myself and my entire family

73
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Any search using my name and the word eternity stories

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
Come up in every job interview had in the last five years it has hurt my career or their children are getting

75
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
Older and might find them that article is a nightmare for me it is cuz, to myself and my children in arnor

76
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
Animal lives I have two daughters 11 and 14 years old we were the cause of

77
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Some major suffering I've suffered depression during people a lot and crushing

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Psychologically

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
I'm just in a corner and it don't know what to do

80
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
It didn't feel good

81
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,903
But we didn't address it at the time we kind of put it aside and didn't act on it but why not

82
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Well

83
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
I mean editors all across the country were getting these emails but there was a long-standing feeling that

84
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,983
Were the first version of history and that these archives are sacrosanct than you would never change them

85
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Journalist like as a profession had this idea that

86
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
That they are the first draft

87
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Active history

88
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Or the public record and you just don't mess with that

89
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,575
And every month I get more of these requests from somebody saying your story is wrecking my life

90
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,695
Can't you please take it down and I dinner every time I'd be Hardline yeah we don't do that

91
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
By the number of these continues

92
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
The antenna increase the man when you read them these are people that are

93
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
They're different imploring you to help them

94
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Over, mistake

95
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
And edit it just it in the end

96
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
I'll let you know we had enough of these in a row where it was

97
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Okay

98
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
We do not want to be

99
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
The agent of suffering

100
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
So Chris made an announcement

101
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
This was a column that I read

102
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
And it said something like you know if you had an article written about you and it was by us

103
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
And you want it taken down or I don't know your name deleted or something send us an email and

104
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Will consider it

105
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,495
I and I and I just thought

106
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Who has the right leg who has a right to be forgotten or who doesn't have the right to be forgotten who's making those decisions what

107
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,271
Are the kinds of things that they're thinking about when they're deciding who to delete and who not to delete

108
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
It's nice talking to Chris I was asking him all of this and for reasons I don't entirely understand he just

109
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Said you're welcome to

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
To listen in now you just come see for yourself

111
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
We talked it out

112
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,751
Just acknowledging this continues to be very much an experiment

113
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Into the room

114
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,127
I Molly Webster high so we can meet you so they meet

115
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
About once a month

116
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
When I visited there were seven people in the room

117
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Hi Molly Heidi standard-issue conference room there was the special projects manager

118
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
Social media editor the public advocacy manager

119
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Crimes editor Mike and Mark

120
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
A former Rock critic who is now the head of the culture desk mark

121
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Mike

122
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
And

123
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
You're okay

124
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
Okay we all sit around a long table

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
Chris outlines the rules of engagement

126
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
We're not going to name the people's we talked about him we'll just use the numbers for the cases

127
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,439
And everyone has in front of them this document that's about 50 pages it has 12 different cases outline

128
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
In each case has got the Articles attached to it the statement of the person about what they want removed the name arm

129
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
Mugshot in a personal plea for why they want it taken down

130
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,799
Cool

131
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
It mean there's one sentence really about him

132
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
I caught up in a in another case

133
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
It didn't plead to a misdemeanor

134
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
And did have it expunged mean this would seem to me

135
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Meaning no brainer

136
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
And

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
But he's an attorney charged with obstruction of justice

138
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
He pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice

139
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
A misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice

140
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Quick note

141
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
For a morass of legal and ethical reasons we are going to try to keep all the people we talked about Anonymous so you're going to hear

142
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Here a number of bleach

143
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,663
Oreo cake using minor figure in it

144
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
Other quarter midgets work you'd want to know that he would have

145
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
On your behalf cuz

146
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Get your off

147
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
I think it's it

148
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,791
That it is a public service delete his name up

149
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
So that people know

150
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
No

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Formation

152
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Have the record expunged

153
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
But he saying

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:26,271
So one of the first things that happened was that they started getting in these arguments about

155
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,647
How much value in article had and whether or not it was serving a public good that's the

156
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
That's the use

157
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
That journalist point

158
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
We do need names we need to put names to these arrests because it's part of the public record

159
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
Kelly McBride she's an ethicist at the pointer in

160
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
I did have this experience where my kid was on a soccer team and there was this coach you seemed really

161
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,151
Questionable to me in the his behavior and the

162
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
The way that he acted around the kids

163
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,087
And you know sure enough on the mugshot site in my local hometown

164
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
This guy showed up for domestic violence

165
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
And

166
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:11,327
I will let you know so I went to the athletic director and I was like Hey the sky can't be

167
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Working for us

168
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
And that's the that's the use

169
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
That journalist point

170
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Is that

171
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
You should be able to find out the bad information about somebody because you might be considering employee

172
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
Famous person around your children

173
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
4

174
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Really employing them at all

175
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,391
And back in the room you know the whole sense of like if I'm one of his customers

176
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
I would probably want to know that there was a lot of debate is this thing the lawyer did bad enough that all of us

177
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Need to know about

178
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
But

179
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
License to practice law alright

180
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
I mean

181
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,799
I need the bar here I mean they're pretty thorough about

182
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
You know looking at this stuff and deciding whether somebody is fit to Pratt

183
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
You know I mean

184
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
The bar didn't do anything

185
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
So one of the big questions is

186
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
How do we make that judgment

187
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Should we follow the courts

188
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,231
You can hear them putting a lot of weight on whether or not a court has sealed or

189
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Expunged record

190
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,143
Which is basically the court making this decision to remove the case from its own record

191
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
This is silver lining on a cord

192
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
It said yes you've done your time

193
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
You can have it sealed

194
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
We would need a very strong argument

195
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
You're not to do that

196
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
How to make your argument stronger why

197
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
I mean

198
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
No I guess

199
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Anybody want to make a strong argument here

200
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:50,399
In the end they decided that this lawyer dude I had the right to be forgotten and so they just sort of like

201
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
From the article

202
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
And that was one of the simpler ones like

203
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,407
That thing's definitely got tougher because some of the cases they talked about where

204
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
So complicated like

205
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
Someone who killed somebody

206
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
And then it was

207
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
Legal self-defense

208
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
And I was like well that's is I mean it's not murder murder but that's like still killing someone like does that person have the right to be forgotten

209
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
And then one of the hardest cases

210
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Alright on the fourth one he did have it expunged

211
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Actually a cop his record was sealed

212
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
But

213
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
You know it is a police officer

214
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
It's fast enough over the course of a few years

215
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
Light on his timesheet and walked away with

216
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Thousands of dollars

217
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
We've said

218
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
On the front end of this

219
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Sex crimes

220
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
Violence crimes in corruption

221
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Were were much less likely did to do this

222
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
So

223
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
I guess this comes down to

224
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,143
Would you view this as corruption or do you view this more as a guy who was

225
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Afton office kind of thing

226
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
The cop

227
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
In his email

228
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
Plea to the group he said basically

229
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Look I've been on the force for many years

230
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
I've never had an issue

231
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
I should have done this I know that but this was just one mistake

232
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
You know this was not

233
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Some elected official this

234
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
It was not

235
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Use of force

236
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
I mean this guy

237
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Skimming over time

238
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
You know what I think

239
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
The firefighters

240
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
We're having

241
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Time stuff to I mean that was a big problem

242
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
So

243
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
It's

244
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
But this is one guy doing one thing is

245
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Like I'm so back and forth on this one

246
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Authorities enough

247
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
He stole from his employer

248
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
I mean this is like any other theft

249
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
I hold him to a higher

250
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Standard

251
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
It was interesting to see people's just like opinion shift

252
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,231
It's not a momentary lapse in judgement this went on for like

253
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
It's only been

254
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Pearson

255
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
The story ran

256
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
And so

257
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
I know that means something to me like this was an ongoing thing about what he had going

258
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Taken

259
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
I need extra money

260
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
And I'm with Mark bike the the public Trust

261
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Issue here

262
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
You know this isn't some

263
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
You know

264
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
Water department guy skimming copper off the

265
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
You know some job site

266
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
This is a police officer

267
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Stealing overtime over

268
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
The corset

269
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
I mean that's

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
A veteran

271
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Describe himself

272
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
But I think that it's

273
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
Yeah I mean I guess I see that

274
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
I don't know I first read that

275
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
But yes I think

276
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
He said let him be forgotten but now

277
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
I'm kind of on the other side like

278
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
And it's not a ton of money is not a public threat

279
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
People but

280
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Because he is in a

281
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Position of trust in a public position

282
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Tax.

283
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Taxpayer money

284
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
I think

285
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
You got the right when you're saying

286
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
He should be held to a higher

287
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,327
Get back to our central question is the value of having his name there

288
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
Greater than the pain it's causing him for being there

289
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
Again and again Chris just steer the conversation back to that question

290
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Which is

291
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
Does the value of having this article up

292
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
Outweigh the harm it's causing someone

293
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
But the trip was that question is

294
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
How do you know what information will be valuable

295
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
In the future I mean if we

296
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
Put the story behind a wall and other police departments don't see it what stops them from going to be

297
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
To get a job if he gets it sealed and the story goes away

298
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
Other than other offices might not be

299
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
I wonder if you lost it

300
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
We should look that up

301
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
We should do the research cuz if if

302
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
I mean we're talking about another Tamir rice guy

303
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Hovering over the conversation was what happened to Tamir rice 12 year old

304
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Tamir rice gun

305
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
So in 2014 in Cleveland police officer shot and killed Tamir rice after they saw him holding

306
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
I did not know this but the cop shot

307
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
And killed Tamir rice before he worked in Cleveland he worked at another Police Department where he was deemed

308
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
And when the

309
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Cleveland Police Department was hiring him

310
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
They didn't

311
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,767
Dig into his records and then the other police department didn't like offer the records

312
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:39,167
And since it had never been a new story that was Google able like no one knew about it so he was

313
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Hired

314
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
If

315
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
If all records of this disappear

316
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,895
And he applies to be a cop again your your would be basically our fault that he's able to

317
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Do bad things

318
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
And so

319
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
In this case one of the thoughts in the room is

320
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
What if

321
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
One of these people

322
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Does something horrendous

323
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Write what if

324
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,975
In in a future

325
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Year

326
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
You know they go in and

327
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
It'll kill 17 people

328
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
When you want to know

329
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,751
About their past transgressions

330
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
I mean wouldn't that make those past transgressions

331
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Relevant again

332
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
And he told me that

333
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
When they do decide to delete someone work we're keeping

334
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
A spreadsheet

335
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Of the names

336
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,487
We've taken out the very limited access how that feels like a crazy

337
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Powerful

338
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Spreadsheet

339
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
I bet it in a vault

340
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
I'm not sure I keep saying is this is an experiment

341
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
And we're not

342
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
We're not there yet

343
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,783
So Indian what they decide to do with the guy

344
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Split Decision

345
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,535
I think no I actually think by the ended once Tamir rice walked into the room

346
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,655
You could steal them the energy shift to the non deletion side

347
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
They just sort of like

348
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Wrap it up

349
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Decided not to delete him

350
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
And then on to the next case which is a very good one and we'll get to it after the break

351
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Okay Radiolab will continue in a moment

352
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
Calling from Firestone Colorado Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing

I'm Jedi boom rods Radiolab were back with Molly webs and the right to be forgotten

356
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
And I have a question for you

357
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Yes

358
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
DIA

359

Play the cleveland.com Newsroom are they the

360
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
First people to do this situation

361
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:16,095
Country around the country newsrooms are tearing their hair out trying to figure out how to deal with this that's pointer

362
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Kelly right again because

363
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,775
There are thousands and thousands of people who did one stupid thing

364
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,127
And that is the thing that the internet remembers them for

365
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,527
One of the things I found out was that it is a huge conversation but not a lot of people are openly talking about it

366
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,623
And all of these kind of quiet conversation seemed to be

367
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Happening now

368
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,743
Because of something that's like bubbling up in Europe

369
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
What's bubbling up in Europe

370
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Well

371
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
So basically what happened was

372
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
In Spain in the sky Mario in 1998 he had basic

373
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,687
Gone into bankruptcy at which point the local newspaper published an announcement about it

374
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
And then 10 years go by

375
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Mario

376
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
Cleaned up got his money back as life back on course and so he reaches out to the newspaper and he was like

377
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
Like a I cleaned up my life

378
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,583
Can you take this bulletin down so it doesn't show up on the internet and the newspaper says no

379
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
DIY they said no

380
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,447
The usual reason that we publish this this is local news

381
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Public records

382
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
First public record done and then he goes to Google and he says he can you delist this from your search

383
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,735
Search engines and they say no and so long story short

384
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Yeah she takes Google

385
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Court

386
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,415
It's all the way up to the European Union Court which is like the Supreme Court of the European Union

387
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,279
And in 2014 the judges in this European case make a decision that

388
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
If something is out of date

389
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Irrelevant

390
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Or not accurate

391
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
A person can request a search engine to take it down

392
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,383
In Europe you can petition to have things taken off the internet yeah and it's

393
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
It is this

394
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
Moment we're like a new right is established this is when you start to hear the phrase right to be forgotten

395
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,672
The unfortunate element of human remembering is it because our

396
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,024
Brain forgets automatically we never had to deal with

397
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,144
Deliberate forgetting disinfector victimization Burger professor of Internet governance

398
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
Oxford University I called him up when I was trying to figure out what was happening in Europe we can't deliberately forget if I tell you

399
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,152
Please forget that my second name is Michael

400
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,480
You will remember that exact opposite

401
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,344
Insult the problem is we don't know how to disregard memories

402
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Avara pass

403
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
We don't know how to forgive if we remember

404
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:56,864
And so as we become a remembering Society we become an unforgiving Society

405
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,936
So he is a strong proponent of policies that help us

406
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Forget

407
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,544
Even just a little bit and that's the point that I wanted to make

408
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
I'm not in favor of

409
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Annihilating memories

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,456
I'm in favor of putting them into shoebox

411
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
And stashing them in the Attic

412
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,624
Send it if you really want to make the effort to go up there you can take them down

413
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
You can read

414
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
Choreographer for glass of wine and go to the

415
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
But

416
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
You don't stumble over them everyday

417
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
And it's some level I think

418
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,984
That's part of the thinking behind the European Union policy like can we just take

419
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,824
Take some of our stuff and put it back in the attic

420
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
And pretty much

421
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Everyone I spoke to

422
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Here

423
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
Says a Mario type of cases

424
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:48,320
Is coming I mean basically the consensus is this is going to start going to court in the states

425
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,392
Trailer when the European Union

426
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Went with

427
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
A right to be forgotten

428
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
Yeah I started to look at that thinking is that we shouldn't have a la like that here cuz of the First Amendment

429
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
What is that something

430
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
As an industry we should

431
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,520
We should consider it and Chris's like we got to do something

432
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
But

433
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,896
We don't want to be alive because of the First Amendment we still want editorial Independence

434
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
So why don't we just figure it out on our own

435
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,296
And this is like every Newsroom figuring it out for themselves

436
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
That

437
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:25,952
Seems to be the moment that were in right now you do really get the sense that it's like on the Fly

438
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
They're figuring it out as they go

439
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
But then you think at what point do rules come into play to do everything on a case-by-case basis by its very nature

440
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
What is subjective

441
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
Alright this is a good one it's college kid who

442
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
Fountain

443
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
So one of the cases that Chris and the other editors

444
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
Talked about while I was there was this college students

445
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
Who got involved in a drug operation

446
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
We're not going to say which drug

447
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
And he was doing it with some friends

448
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
We're not going to say how many this is one of the kids asking us

449
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,768
Again it's it's going back it's funny

450
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
It is

451
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,608
College kid doing something very very stupid

452
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Bye

453
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
You know what are you

454
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
He's going to talk him for the rest of his life

455
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
If it stays on our side

456
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Somebody knows about it

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
Yeah but this is this is a college kid

458
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,528
Doing something really dumb that mean it's bad leaving he was enabling people to do drugs

459
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Is later

460
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
He's trying to get on with his life the first. You here in the room is just

461
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
Oh my God we were all idiots in college we should take these articles down

462
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
If somebody does speak up

463
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,704
But then on the other side difference between

464
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,824
And you know selling pot on the side when you're in

465
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
College

466
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Or even selling drugs

467
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Other drugs

468
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,832
So it seemed to me like you're I don't know if that's

469
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Think white girl let's take a

470
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Now look I mean so I'm like give until I give this guy a break

471
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
But

472
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Seems to me that

473
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,824
Judging from like some of the other cases we've looked at this

474
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Fairly serious

475
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
He wasn't one of the ones

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Said they had

477
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,248
They were getting cleaned right like he wasn't saying I was under the influence

478
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
What's the drive time

479
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
Diamine

480
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,904
The conversation turns to okay

481
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
Who is he does he deserve to be forgotten

482
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
And to figure that out there are ton of different questions you could ask

483
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,144
You know is he sober is he reformed was he sober then

484
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
How much time has passed how much time was he doing it

485
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Question

486
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,360
Are the other people in here having a difficult time getting job I mean there's a lot of unknowns here

487
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
You know I mean all these other people their life might be fine maybe there's another reason this guy isn't getting jobs you know

488
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
We know

489
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,184
That he hasn't done anything since then

490
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,024
How do you say it's coming up in every job interview yes right

491
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
Doesn't employer

492
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Have a right to know this

493
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:20,032
Does an employer

494
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Let us know

495
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
I will take it down

496
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,736
Later he was in college was 25 it wasn't like he was 18

497
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
To remove the fact that

498
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
This is a clean-cut kid

499
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
Who was going to a private college

500
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,232
And move the scenario to the same age

501
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
The same race

502
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,888
But not in college and in some rural community

503
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,192
Questions of race and class

504
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Come into the room all the other doors are white

505
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
Most wins College themselves

506
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
Is that biasing them in some way

507
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,200
I mean what our willingness to to forgive this kid

508
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
Be different if the social economic

509
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Issue taser

510
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
This isn't about forgiveness

511
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
It's about the idea

512
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Then on our site

513
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Because we're so big

514
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
When you search for somebody

515
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
This is the first thing you find and we haven't set any kind of economic strata for this we have instead of geographic

516
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,800
Xstrata were considering each case as it comes in this case does this kid

517
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Deserve to have

518
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,408
His name is Izzy and always it

519
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
Is enough time passed

520
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Is is

521
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
It's not a crime of violence and Corruption

522
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
And you're not really the central question

523
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
As you heard Chris reacted

524
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,000
The abruptly to the word forgiveness being brought into the room

525
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
I don't I don't think we are in a position

526
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
To forget I asked him about it

527
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
After meeting ended I think it's almost

528
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
Presumptuous for me to think

529
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
That I can forgive these people

530
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
I bet you but

531
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
I agree that is that is it

532
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
But in a sentence

533
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Taking on

534
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
If we if we

535
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Acknowledge these people and

536
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Offer them respite

537
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
Will help the rest of the world do that

538
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
To that that to me sounds like

539
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Forgiveness

540
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
Okay I don't I'm not

541
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
I don't feel like

542
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
We're forgiving

543
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
7 people

544
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,336
Who asked for this relief I feel like

545
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Wer

546
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
Or enabling them

547
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
To carry on

548
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
With their lives

549
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
Without the baggage

550
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,648
Of the mistakes they made cuz we're at societies very judgemental and end

551
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
If somebody looks them up

552
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Cease that they did this

553
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
It's a big Mark against them I think what we can do is

554
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Is

555
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,864
Is kind of revert back

556
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
To the way things worked before the internet the way it used to be

557
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,568
Right well if we think the answer to this is to find a way

558
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
To unpublish everything that

559
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,504
Somehow we collectively think ought to be unpublished that is a pipe dream

560
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
Iran Chris's thought by Deborah Dwyer

561
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,184
Who is a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of media and journalism

562
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,512
I was talking to her because she has been studying journalists

563
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
And how they're approaching takedown requests in this whole like right to be forgotten issue

564
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
And basically what she told me is you can only delete so much

565
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,568
Yeah. We're never going to be able to eradicate our path that

566
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
That day

567
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
That ship has sailed

568
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
But

569
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
The power

570
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
That we give

571
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
An arrest report from 10 years ago

572
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
On a minor offense

573
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
That some

574
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
Dilly child dead and

575
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,072
There now grown-up and responsible and attempting to get into law school

576
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
People

577
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
Actually have the power to determine

578
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
How important that is

579
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Right

580
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
How much weight do we give that

581
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,848
Organizations I talked to said they were considering not

582
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Covering

583
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Arrests

584
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Or Court

585
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
Cases actual trial

586
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
Unless they could see them through their completion

587
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
Part of this might be being better about choosing on the front end what types of stuff we want to commit to

588
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Digital memory

589
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,816
But part of this is a shifting our perspectives

590
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
Because if you can never totally forget something

591
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
You have to learn

592
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
How to forgive

593
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
Without forgetting

594
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Right

595
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:42,176
But we live in a world of revenge p*** and mugshot extortion website and public

596
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
What shaming

597
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
And

598
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
So is that the type of society we want to be

599
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:52,160
Because against Society that's going to forgive you for that thing you did 10 years ago

600
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Well

601
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
Likely not right now but that information

602
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
There's never going to be

603
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,168
A perfect way to clean up everyone

604
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,496
Path that is we've got to learn to live with it

605
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
And

606
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
If we

607
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
Cant decide Maybe

608
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
That

609
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,200
We oughta address it with a little bit of compassion

610
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
That just be hoe

611
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,256
Doing that one I'm looking for one of the simple ones just the delete

612
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
This is just to leave him like a two sentence paragraph maybe you're one sentence paragraph to just has his name Skies name

613
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Delete

614
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,456
Then I add a note at the top

615
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Pizza Hut

616
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
The story was updated to remove some

617
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
According to the

618
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Cleveland.com

619
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Pacific mattress

620
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Top

621
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Oh you put in a date

622
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Allen

623
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
What's a note

624
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Save

625
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Fiance

626
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Thank God

627
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:34,048
All right will one person's going to be really happy when he Googled his name today

628
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Right

629
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
Is it all just changed

630
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Google take me to private

631
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
I'll get the ticket to all of them by

632
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,824
Probably well the end of next week's I'm going to be out of town in the beginning

633
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Cool

634
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,200
That's This Is Where I Leave You

635
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
When's your flight

636
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
Well I'm going to say we

637
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
What do you walk away from the whole Cleveland experience think

638
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
That I was confused

639
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
I just wanted the things is that

640
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
You can walk into that room

641
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
You're making this decision

642
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
And

643
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
You don't have a lot of information to go offer like if you're lucky you have an email

644
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Maybe

645
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Stealing order

646
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,128
And articles that featured the person

647
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
And at times I feels like not enough information

648
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
I used to think like I want more

649
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,136
And then other times you think it would be bad if we had more information because then I might just start

650
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
Like judging this person

651
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Am I taxed to get more subjective

652
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
I don't know

653
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
But

654
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
There's one more chapter to the story

655
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,264
While a very long while after I got back from Cleveland I got an email from Chris

656
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,640
And it said that that day they had just done another round of right to be forgotten

657
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Petitions

658
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,784
And that he thought that one of the people would be interested in talking to me

659
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
About what they did

660
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
And

661
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Why they wanted to be delete it

662
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
So at that point I called the sky

663
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Hello

664
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
How are you

665
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Okay

666
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
I made it

667
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Nervous is fair

668
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Gresham traffic

669
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
I was a minute late

670
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
I'm just make sure everything's settled on my end so I have you until noon is that right what time do you need to get back to work

671
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Are you

672
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
I can be here longer if need be I will just like roll with it then

673
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Let me power down my phone

674
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
Do you know how

675
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Try this whole episode we've been like Bleeding Out facts

676
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
We're going to keep doing that with this case will just like hold back some information in some instances we might

677
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
Change the fact

678
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
Sure it is obviously a risk

679
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
For the sky be talking to us

680
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
When I give him the chance of anonymity

681
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,056
I'm but he is up for that risk

682
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Well

683
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
You go on a journey like this

684
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Is a

685
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
The person who really never

686
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:05,088
Insight from a speeding ticket really never interacted with the criminal justice system and

687
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
You

688
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Between Jazeera

689
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Way of thinking

690
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,536
And how you approach life and how you approached each day and so

691
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,096
By me perhaps talking about it

692
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Maybe

693
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
It gets people thinking about it

694
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Trying to

695
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
To gain understanding I guess

696
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
So the story is this guy

697
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
Should I give him a name like fake name

698
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
Yeah give me a call

699
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Seth okay

700
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
So

701
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,112
Back in the lake

702
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
Mm 2018

703
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Seth

704
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,024
Was just like living a pretty solid life

705
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Job

706
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Wife two kids

707
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
And then

708
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Over the course of a few weeks

709
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
I expose myself

710
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
Two women

711
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
Once in his neighborhood in front of a woman who is driving by

712
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,176
The cops showed up later that day but they just sort of gave him a warning

713
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
We all nothing really happened

714
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
Until days later when I did it again

715
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
This time it was to another woman

716
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
And what state was at the gym

717
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Cited by police

718
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
The demonym starting

719
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
I called my wife

720
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
And I and I met her

721
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
A local park

722
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
I told her he tells her

723
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
What happened

724
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Because everything

725
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,384
Tell her everything and part of what they talked about that day with something that happened years before

726
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Yeah

727
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
When I was 10 or 11

728
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
I sexually abused now

729
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
It

730
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
I didn't think of it as abuse at the time

731
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Are you

732
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,440
Build a lot of Guild a lot of Fame

733
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
I thought I was in on it

734
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
So

735
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,096
Who's probably okay you know that's what I was thinking

736
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
And I really didn't think it had an effect on me

737
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
Again these are not excuses but I think the

738
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Really though the

739
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
The most

740
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
Damaging thing was

741
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
How I

742
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Was introduced

743
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Two sacs

744
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
And how

745
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
That became an issue me not

746
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Getting help for that

747
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,672
I guess I'm talking all about me

748
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
But you know what

749
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Really

750
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Frightened

751
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Two women

752
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
And

753
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Sorry I'm just

754
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Sorry

755
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
Eventually set the has to go down to the

756
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
Police station

757
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:36,640
His mugshot taken and actually get charged like misdemeanor charges against him

758
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,504
This was a couple weeks later when the police officer called today actually going to file charges come down to police station

759
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
I am

760
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,344
I went dumb and I'm pretty much okay we got to go we got to go I got to go

761
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,416
And I was wearing a hoodie and it just woken up and

762
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,512
No thought of my mind was like they're going to take a mugshot

763
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
But they did

764
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Molly if you ever get

765
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Cited

766
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
Ever get called police station

767
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,568
Come take a shower wear something nice because

768
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
It was so horrible

769
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
It's always there I'm not I'm just a couple keystrokes away

770
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
For my mugshot

771
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
The worst picture I took the worst day of my life

772
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,624
So if this it just stayed in the court system

773
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
No one would have ever seen that mugshot

774
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Because

775
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,328
You know Seth just gets this point where he's like guilty I just want my

776
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,656
I will plead guilty to everything I don't want

777
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
I did

778
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
I want to take responsibility for

779
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
And I'm sorry

780
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
He pays a fine

781
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,104
Service probation

782
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,736
We're told the issue some sort of statement of apology to the women I get to New therapist

783
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
But then of course

784
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,600
In the midst of this he gets a call from a local newspaper

785
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
Somebody

786
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,928
Tip them off that I had then

787
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
Cited for

788
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
Indecent exposure

789
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,168
From there it was picked up by paper after paper and different like online news sites until it was all over the place

790
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
How do you think about you think about me or my parents are still alive what are they going to do

791
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
Iridescent paper

792
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
The kids

793
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
Yeah

794
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Stellata shame

795
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
It's almost like you

796
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
James what you deserve

797
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,392
And so by the time that stuff starts rolling out he tells his kids

798
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
He ultimately loses his job

799
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
In the whole same thing

800
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
So when I would walk around and go to the grocery store

801
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Things like that

802
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
And I'm sure it was delusional by like everybody's looking at me there is pointing it out since you know again so my kids to my

803
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
My

804
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
Your son goes off to college meets people

805
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Hey Google

806
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
And

807
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,248
Unique name and Hometown and there I am

808
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
So

809
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
I think that that's really up

810
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
Big part of the damages

811
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Family

812
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
And they don't

813
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Aiden

814
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
You don't deserve it

815
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,584
He said a particularly low moment

816
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Was

817
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
When his daughter came to him

818
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
And said you're the number one news story

819
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
Oh wow you know how you can see like a top news stories for your area if you're in a search engine if you doing like Google Now

820
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
News or something

821
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,760
Apparently his story was the first one

822
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
And it was his mug

823
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
Shot in really salacious

824
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Story about me

825
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
He didn't do a creepy dark

826
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Condescending

827
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Totally but that's

828
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
At the heart of the question like

829
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
How do you weigh

830
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,288
The value of US knowing about Seth and what he did

831
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Against the harm

832
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
It's doing to him and his family

833
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
You know in

834
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
This moment all of us are probably making different decisions in our heads

835
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
But here's what Acts

836
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
According to the law

837
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:04,512
Year after he's done everything the court asks him to do he can apply to have his records sealed

838
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
Which he did

839
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
And the judge agreed

840
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
I got them

841
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
Finally sealed

842
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Mets

843
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,032
This year and no one has access to the judges thinking the records are sealed but not long after that

844
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,872
He saw the cleveland.com is doing this right to be forgotten thing

845
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
And so he was like oh that could be me like I could do this

846
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,296
I wasn't sure if I get approved but I still had hope when I sent it

847
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
Try to get craft a good email really

848
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
State my case as much as I could

849
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
So I

850
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
Have the letter that Seth wrote

851
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
To the right to be forgotten team at cleveland.com and I'm not going to read the whole thing here but just to give you a few

852
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
You excerpt

853
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
It says

854
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,800
Years have now passed since my mental crisis am I very public and salacious brush with the law

855
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
I'm grateful for a few things

856
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,687
The love and support of my family guided me out of the darkness

857
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
I'm here and not in a cemetery because of that

858
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,391
I continues I'm also happy that I was able to model for my children

859
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,951
Exactly how a person should behave

860
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
After making a Monumental mistake

861
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:15,167
While I would do anything to turn back the clock alter my actions and spare two women from my frightening Behavior

862
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
I simply cannot change the past

863
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
And it goes on

864
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
I ask that you consider me and my actions for the right to be forgotten initiative and that you remove my name and photos from the

865
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,455
The Articles written about me

866
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
I'm grateful for this consideration

867
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Thank you

868
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
So

869
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,879
I got an email from Chris saying that we met and we've been

870
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
And you've been approved

871
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
And

872
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,327
He said something like they were mentions and there's really no way to

873
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
Just take out your name

874
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
So we're just going to take the

875
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Stories.

876
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Wow

877
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
So I talked to Chris

878
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
About

879
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,871
Taking all the Articles down and he said like first thing

880
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,943
McKay's is just so notorious

881
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,319
But taking steps name out wouldn't actually allow him to be forgotten

882
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,159
And so it just made more sense to delete all of the articles

883
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
The other thing is

884
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:16,607
Seem like a case of just kind of fit into the rules that are emerging in these committee meeting

885
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,399
These are misdemeanors

886
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:23,263
You know it wasn't violent crime it was a corruption it wasn't a celebrity

887
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,359
They thought he seemed apologetic there had been no other instances

888
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
So

889
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
To them

890
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
It seems like

891
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,991
Pretty cut-and-dry decision

892
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
You know it's still like I still have

893
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
That was not the only Outlet

894
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
That the stuff appeared in

895
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
So I still have a Google problem but again

896
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:47,071
Like the record Being sealed like every little step and every day that passes every bit of time

897
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,375
You leave a mistake in the past

898
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Inure

899
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
One step

900
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
Closer to a New Life Second Chance

901
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Something better

902
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
And this was a big milestone

903
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,199
I have question about the women who you expose yourself to

904
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,551
That's Radiolab producer Annie McEwen she was in on the interview with

905
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Fat

906
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,951
As far as the women go their Anonymous and all the articles in the records are sealed

907
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:19,583

911
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
To somehow discover that

912
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,799

924
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
They might be upset

925
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
