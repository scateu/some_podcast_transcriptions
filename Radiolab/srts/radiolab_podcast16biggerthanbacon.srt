1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab today

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
We have a mystery that is vanishingly Tiny

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
Shockingly hot and managers to combine submarines Keanu Reeves Red Lobster in Game of Thrones

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Producer Molly Webster

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Many members of his family

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Hello hello hello hello

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,776
Where are the children you want to begin in the beautiful state of

11
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
South Carolina South Carolina

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
On a pier is my radio Gear waterproof

13
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,808
Onondaga case we're going to walk down to the docking which is just looked

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
The place where they all put boats in the water and that's where we always

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,560
I like a bomba

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
My parents recently moved to this

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Marshy swampy area near the Intracoastal Waterway which is like a connecting series of

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Salty Channel

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
And we grew up in Ohio and he was like

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Totally different landscape than what we were up a little people would be my nieces and nephews

21
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,344
The Weeknd ride it back America was or my children

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,184
Getting along and compromise Webster one of my sisters

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
Every time the weather like

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
Okay so this is the story of the story is

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
So my parents first move there and remember going out on the docks with my dad and we are sort of looking at the beautiful

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Marsh rides

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
And it was really weird sound like

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Coming off the water

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
I recently took my nieces and nephew out to see if they could

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Allen vs

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
They're not going to move

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Are not going to squeak

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Macintosh

34
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Not going to talk

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Okay so we leaned down off the dock and see if we can hear it

36
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
Oh my gosh I hear some Crackle

37
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
That crackling sound

38
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
Yeah what is that

39
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
That was a question

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
It sounds

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Sounds like rice

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Most of the scientist you talked to say it sounds like bacon frying or Twigs crackling in a fire

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
Maybe have a large.

44
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
I would say that except there's no bubbles popping like on the water

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
Oh so it's not a gaseous emission it's a

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Clickety clack

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Let me just pay you a better record

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Yeah but up

49
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
What do I have to put it through the producer PC

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
I went.

51
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
This is actually under water report

52
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
Oh my God

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Cashing a teeny world that would be like the 4th of July

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
Kevin Bacon Bacon you're frying what is the sound what is it

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,360
This sound is a very tiny

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
Welded the story started in the forties

57
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
That's Michelle over spouse of physical Acoustics and medical Acoustics at the University of Toronto in the

58
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Basically what he said is

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,512
World War II is the first war were like really using submarines and sonar

60
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
And so you've got all of these u.s. Navy submarines down deep in the ocean and they're like listening out for the

61
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
The enemy but what happened is all they hear is this

62
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Like crazy crackling sound levels that were measured so very very until

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
He says in some instances is actually interfering with the sonar

64
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:12,672
I found a classified document that was Declassified right after the war

65
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Wear the Navy they actually

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Tired

67
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Actually hired this scientist is guy named Martin Johnson this is in California San Diego

68
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Go at the scripture hired this guy to figure out

69
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
What is the sound like what is the sound we're hearing like all over the ocean what is it already

70
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Tell me what the damn sound

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
Yes well

72
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
It turns out I don't want to go too fast year notice in those years that that sound originated

73
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Tickets from

74
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Bishop B's Tampa

75
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
It was

76
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,511
Shrimp oh yeah shrimp is called a snapping shrimp

77
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Or a pistol

78
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,399
Pistol like that

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
An interesting lead I found these like Old Navy recording

80
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Did they win

81
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
Give to the Navy guys were they had to learn the sounds they were hearing coming in through the ship and through the sonar

82
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,623
Work with the Expendables radio tunnel Bowie you will probably hear many sound other than submarine

83
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
It was like this is the sound of a snapping turtle

84
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
It produces a harsh clicking noise

85
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,679
Okay shrimp sonar cool I get it in there

86
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
And then I found with altamese be a crazy article which is newspaper clipping from 19

87
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
46

88
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Basically says

89
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
Shrimps Help win the war

90
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
And it's about how the American Navy admitted that one of their tactical sings during

91
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
Like World War II was that they would hide their submarines in the beds of these trim

92
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
So I like the Japanese submarines couldn't detect our shift

93
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Visibility clothes

94
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Yes

95
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
And according to Michelle the US would also speakers on the hull of the ship

96
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
22 simulator

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
Snapping shrimp it was sound camo

98
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,343
Yeah so we may we are these are they like normal normal shrimp cocktail shrimp

99
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,159
Welder about the 5 cm

100
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
2in feel like smaller than a shrimp

101
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Depends what sort of shrimp you eat

102
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Why do whatever

103
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
River Red Lobster

104
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,959
If they're that small how are they making that sound

105
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
That

106
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Is Xanax

107
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
Silly question we where do you think the sound comes from

108
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
I'm thinking

109
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
It's

110
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
Fish and bees are eating

111
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
There

112
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Illinois's is there little

113
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,415
Woosh Beauty teeth

114
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
TV I think it comes from

115
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
They're like

116
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,607
Clotting easy and that's what you would think right like especially if you look at these things up close they have

117
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Two front claws

118
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
And

119
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,495
The clothes aren't the same on each side that's Nancy Knowlton a marine biologist

120
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Snapping shrimp

121
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Expert

122
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,151
Claudette specialized for pinching and a class tiny and a Claddagh specialized for snap

123
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
And that clot is like

124
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
Exponentially bigger it's like 10 times

125
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
20

126
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
Maybe three times bigger is quite a bit bigger

127
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
And so they use it to defend themselves against

128
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
Potential predators are competitors

129
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
They're very territorial

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
She doesn't want shrimp runs into another shrimp can get into these prolonged snapping matches where they snap at each other to show

131
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,287
Me this means bigger and stronger

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Okay Vine

133
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Anakin

134
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Mike Judge how big they are by the

135
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Power of the snap

136
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
All of which is to say

137
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
My niece Sophie's guess

138
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Their likes

139
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,647
Clotting issue of course it's like the two sides of the claw just like snapping

140
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
Just like you snap your fingers like this just a snap

141
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Snap without and turns out not to be

142
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
So not true

143
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Who sings

144
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,983
Were wrong basically with a picture so I don't know if you ever try to clap your hands

145
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
In swimming pool

146
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
Underwater but never difficult you don't feel very smart

147
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
That's not a lot of that is because there's a lubrication layer water in between that prevents direct mechanical

148
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Contact yes there's this lubricating layer between the two claw halves and it makes snapping hard

149
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,303
And the second problem was that sound the same way too loud

150
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
When they measure the

151
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
The decibel level of a single snap

152
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,543
220 decibels of sound that that can be produced by by single snap

153
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
To put that in context that is basically equivalent to

154
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
From Just One Snap

155
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
But it's very

156
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Impulsive

157
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Sinsaenum very very short

158
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Jewish

159
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
Still sick one of the loudest sounds in the ocean

160
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
So Michelle was like

161
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Probably more than snapping

162
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
I'm going on here

163
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Yes I said so

164
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
So it was 1999 a new high-speed camera in our lab

165
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Camera at

166
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,615
The shrimp and see what happens when they say shrimp

167
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Snapchat

168
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,991
Claw they takes a little shrimps and they glue screws on their butts

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
Igloo screws on them

170
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
Screw them into tiny platforms

171
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,743
It's like a little aquarium so that they were fixed in space and that was important

172
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
Because I happened in like a microsecond and they need to keep it

173
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
Still see the camera can focus right on the clock

174
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
And to do the experiment what we needed to do was to tickle them a little bit

175
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
With the paintbrush

176
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
You tickle them with a paintbrush

177
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
They're closed

178
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
Nmda

179
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
And then

180
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Fires

181
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
And the camera captures

182
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
The entire thing was like thousands of frames

183
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Did they say anything they did see something

184
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
What it what happened what is it when they look at the footage of the moment

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Just after its snaps

186
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
In super slow-mo very blurry

187
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Object

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
In front of the shrimp

189
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
What will blurry had it was just like bloppy Blurry something

190
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
It was blurry blurry especially

191
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
I mean it turned out that we were

192
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Certified auto focus

193
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
So they refocus the camera they do the same thing they take all the shrimp the cloth snaps

194
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
And they see that win the claw snap

195
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
They see

196
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Dislike

197
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
In front of the shrimp

198
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
Claw and it turns out that it's that bubble that's

199
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Causing

200
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
The noise and

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,703
This is so much undersea turmoil

202
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,055
In with the high-speed camera they were sort of able to see how it all breaks down

203
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Netsertive unfold like

204
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
What actually happens when this Club closes is that

205
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
The water that is in between these claws to squeeze out at high speed

206
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
The typical speed

207
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
Can be up to 60 miles per hour

208
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
60 miles per hour in what happens is

209
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
China jet

210
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
Empty spaces created like a little voice

211
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
All the water molecules in that space cuz they start to expand outwards

212
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
And essentially they just become like a little gas bubble change from liquid to gas

213
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
They actually go from like liquid is like tightly packed molecules and then as they spread out they become like gaseous

214
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
And they create this like little bubble pocket in the middle of the huge ocean and as they have all the space they like

215
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
I can figure and bigger and bigger until the oceans like nope microseconds later the ocean star

216
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Cushing

217
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,455
Back in on this bubble and the all the little the little love

218
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,783
Are molecules in the Indus bubble have nowhere to go in there

219
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
Force closer and closer together and so they really want to get away from

220
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,255
All those are molecules but you're pushing them together really hard and since they can't get away from each other like that

221
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Energy build-up super super

222
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Acute pressure Rises and the temperature rises

223
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Really Rises

224
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
5000 degrees the surface of the Sun is also 5000 degrees

225
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
Sit inside the bubble turns to plasma

226
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:39,551
And that plasma image very short intense flash of light

227
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,671
Edesur bubble inflows and then

228
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Like a microsecond later degenerates to Shockwave

229
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
And that Shockwave

230
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Will basically

231
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Kill or stun

232
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
Any I pray that this nearby somebody from the College of exaggeration graduated this

233
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Explanation

234
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Because you

235
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
Teeny little animals

236
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
Okay

237
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
That's amazing

238
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,767
How Eeveelution Master created this kind of Sonic weapon

239
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
So basically

240
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Quality

241
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Generate huge bubbles Heat

242
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
It's like

243
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
The Black Veil

244
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Spitting out light

245
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
End

246
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Hot hot hot temperature

247
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Yeah

248
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Does that mean

249
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,855
That's crazy I feel like it should be like a Marvel

250
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Character

251
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Totaling

252
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Yeah cuz if you scaled this up

253
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
The bubble bee the size of a basque

254
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Humanscale

255
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
What can I do with a basket

256
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
Fall of sun Heat

257
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Light

258
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,471
Rule the world

259
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,199
Song about with my sister's hanging off the dock she asks like can we use this to power like

260
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Make the world or something

261
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Know the answer was no

262
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
But the same physical process

263
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Disease that are involved in the shrimp Bubba

264
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Pulse right sole

265
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
The temperature in

266
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Heat that bubbles

267
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Create

268
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Researchers became really excited about is there a way to

269
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
Harness this bubble power

270
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,679
Yeah that's also a Hollywood movie I think I did it

271
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Is it stable on powerful couples with Tatiana Reeves Rd

272
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
There is enough energy in this glass of water to power the city of Chicago

273
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
Went too far

274
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Taken with the web

275
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
With the weapon possibility

276
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Yeah my nephew got excited about

277
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Bastille

278
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
But

279
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
I hate to tell you I don't think there are any you can like make a bear claw tub

280
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Sorry guys

281
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
There is one thing

282
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Where

283
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
Researchers are thinking about using bubbles in this goes beyond the shrimp bubble

284
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
In a way that

285
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Save-A-Lot

286
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
My name is Josie Packard I'm calling from Columbia South Carolina where do you live is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan

287
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,895
Foundation for enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

288
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,503
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

289
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
This is Radiolab now going to go back to the story from Molly Webster

290
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
You were saying people here are trying to use bubble power

291
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Save lives

292
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
Yeah so when I was talking to Michelle versluis

293
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Applications

294
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
We're talking on the phone and he explains all the crazy bubbly stuff and somehow like in the middle of a conversation

295
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
And he just said

296
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
If you think the shrimp bubbles are cool

297
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
Everything we know about the shrimp bubbles like

298
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Can also be like

299
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
Adapted to use bubbles in the body

300
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Oh and I

301
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,439
Like what in the body is

302
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,767
Totally I had the same thought like when divers get the bends or when they like

303
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,911
Tap bubbles out of IV lines and stuff but these are very very small bubbles smaller than red blood cells

304
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
According to her

305
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,543
Are sloths there like 1 20th the size of human hair

306
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
And he told me about how in Toronto and they actually just did this for the first time in November

307
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
On a patient

308
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
They're using bubbles to get across the blood-brain barrier

309
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
What is what exactly is the brain

310
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Blood-brain barrier

311
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
It sells or is it

312
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
Yeah in tissue super super tightly packed

313
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Cells

314
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
Is there a sits between the bloodstream and the Brain

315
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
It's like this protective wall

316
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,263
And it keeps out all is like the nasty stuff so it keeps out any like

317
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Bacteria or viruses that would be

318
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,199
In your bloodstream can't get past the wall to get into your brain I kind of keep thinking of it as like

319
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,831
I've never actually watched Game of Thrones except for like one episode and if there was this

320
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Giant wall

321
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Yeah

322
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
To protect

323
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
Civilization from third of all of the the bad thing

324
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
The Wild Thing

325
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
It was made of ice and it went up

326
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
Forever I kind of feel like that wall in Game of Thrones is like the barrier

327
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Are between

328
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
The rest of the body in the brain

329
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,151
But you said it's there to protect the brain so why would you want to punch a hole

330
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Well you can imagine that if somebody has a brain tumor and we want to deliver chemicals in there that we think can

331
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
Help fight the tumor

332
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
Those chemicals the brain does not want in there

333
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
So the blood-brain barrier can create problems

334
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
According to Todd

335
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Give me a price on a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook

336
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,679
He's part of the team in Toronto that using this new bubble technique and here's how it works

337
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,287
Okay so say you got a tumor on the right side of your brain right above your ears

338
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
You're so mean price in the team will stick you in a chair and then I'll put a helmet on

339
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Special helmet

340
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
This helmet has 1024

341
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
Ultrasound transducers

342
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
And we aim

343
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
2024 Altima same spot

344
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
Right on the spot at the wall where the tumor sets

345
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Just on the other side

346
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Just Out Of Reach

347
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Okay so they all the ultrasound waves kind of

348
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Focus at that one area

349
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
And then we we inject the bubbles

350
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
How many bubbles are in adults

351
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
Like hundreds of thousands

352
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Play just put an IV in your arm

353
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
And the bubbles go in

354
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
A no-go like into your arm like over your shoulder into your heart to your lungs back to your heart eventually some of them will get

355
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Up to the brain approximately 28 seconds from the time we inject the bubble into arm vein to buy time

356
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,095
I start going into a brain and eventually some of those bubbles get up

357
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
To the blood-brain barrier that wall

358
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,031
To the spot without laser beam is focused at specific spot is tumor sitting on the other side of and when they cross

359
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,103
Have with that beat

360
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Ultrasound waves causes

361
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,479
The microbubbles to oscillate in size

362
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Google big and small big and small big mouth

363
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
Bubble dance party so at this really specific part in the brain and it can be small

364
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Smaller than like 1 millimeter by 1 mm Square all these bubbles are dancing and what that does is it

365
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
Causes the wall specific spot to almost loose it and so like a little

366
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Like a window of space or a little hole is created in that wall and if you happen to have chemo

367
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,879
Therapy in your blood which you will because ahead of time the minute that hole is open

368
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
Good ideas to chemotherapy in your bloodstream would be able to just order

369
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,071
Flow through that opening and get straight to that brain tumor

370
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
Instead of using sound to turn the

371
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
Bubbles and Tall dancing robot

372
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
Yeah drill through the wall

373
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
Wow now that the bodies of living organism

374
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
So

375
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Over the next

376
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,223
6 to 12 hours they will close those

377
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Gaps

378
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Transient

379
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Meaning

380
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
It heals itself

381
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,671
In about 6 to 12 hours and you say they try this on someone

382
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Yeah last November

383
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
And I think it went well

384
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
One of the things these researchers said was

385
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Once

386
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
You're able to open these passageways

387
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
To the brain

388
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
It's not just chemo that can get in there but like suddenly any type of drug you might want to send through can can get through

389
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,223
Through and we just never had access to the Brain before in that way and there's a question of

390
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
How will drugs interact with the brain

391
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
Kind of don't know they've they've never been there before

392
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
It's like a whole new frontier

393
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
Using shrimp in time is done

394
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
So

395
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
I mean basically all boils down to the same

396
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
Physics of bubbles that we have

397
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,104
Learn from the shrimp that we can apply to many other

398
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
Applications

399
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,832
Wicked put it on the radio so you'll hear it.

400
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
People that like

401
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
Why do people don't like shrimp

402
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,256
Then they'll just keep it

403
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
I make no promises this is gone on the radio

404
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
Molly Webster this piece was produced by Molly and

405
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
Annie McEwen with help from our guest sound designer

406
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Jeremy Bloom special thanks to clear the James Byrd Lawrence from Aunt Sophia

407
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
Albert in graffiti letters

408
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Next up a story from our producer Simon Adler who who got interested in bubbles

409
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Sasha Molly founder shrimpy's

410
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,408
Got instant Bubbles and you manage to find a guy named Dave Stein

411
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Who is taking bubbling

412
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,040
To a whole new level why is a bigger bubble better

413
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,648
Really trying to make things bigger is a function of growing up

414
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,744
I don't know I always thought this was kind of inherent in the

415
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Human psyche is

416
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
He's bigger and better and so

417
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
Well we might even make this

418
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Stein's law

419
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Okay

420
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Spain's law

421
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
A bubble of bubbling

422
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Stein's law of size

423
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
Turn off the top of my head

424
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Air Bud

425
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
For any given

426
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Object

427
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
There is

428
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Hey

429
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Larger size

430
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
Such that the nature

431
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
What's the object

432
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Is transformed

433
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
In simple English what would that be in the

434
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
As something gets bigger it gets

435
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
What

436
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Okay

437
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Take

438
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Jupiter

439
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Okay gaseous

440
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Planets

441
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
All right

442
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Gates fuel tank

443
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Jupiter bigger and bigger

444
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
Bigger and bigger at there is a size

445
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
At which

446
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
It becomes

447
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Star

448
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Hagen it ignites

449
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
The Sun

450
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
It transcends what it was

451
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Then

452
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Can a bubble get so big

453
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
That it's no longer even a bubble

454
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Well

455
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
Before the invention

456
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Of the bubble

457
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
1980

458
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Bubbles

459
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
We always thought of as

460
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
Being relatively small

461
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
And relatively round

462
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
But

463
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
As soon as you get

464
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Up to a certain size

465
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Say

466
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
5 foot diameter

467
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Kind of in that rain

468
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
I know suddenly they're not round any

469
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
And

470
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
They don't pop in the same way

471
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,168
People who would think of bubbles popping instantaneously because they're thinking it was a little round bubbles

472
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
The dime store

473
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
And what really happened

474
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
In

475
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Very large bubbles like the ones

476
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
My friends make

477
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
The Bible doesn't pop

478
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Instantaneously

479
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
It gets

480
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
Punctured at a certain point and then it

481
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Ripped open like a zipper

482
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
And there's a sound to it

483
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
It kind of goes

484
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Pie tap

485
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
So it's not

486
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
It's

487
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
A from 100 this long bubble

488
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
To the other

489
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Can we back up to

490
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
Tell me the story of how you like why

491
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
Who were you in 1984 when you're like

492
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm going to make

493
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
This bubbles

494
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
What what what what motivated Olive

495
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,576
Well what motivated all of this was I was in architecture

496
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
The time I was working

497
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
For Heidi Holtzman Pfeiffer very fashionable

498
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
Affirm downtown and he says he spent his days designing these

499
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Really intricate building

500
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Swear like

501
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Glass staircases

502
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
Meet the stonework of the building at a

503
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
45° angle

504
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
And the roof is going

505
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,472
Another I don't have to work down to the

506
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
16th of an inch

507
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Wasn't very happy

508
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
In fact

509
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
I used to worry about

510
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Structural collapse

511
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
He said he'd be walking down the streets of Manhattan

512
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
Imagining some building he was building in his mind

513
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
Say the addition to

514
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,208
Did the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts at he's imagining this building and then all of a sudden his mind with shipt

515
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Worry

516
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
About that building collapse

517
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
And he says this just kept happening with every project

518
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
All these buildings

519
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,008
Crashing to the ground and just keep you up at night did you wake up yeah I felt I had to

520
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
I felt it as read

521
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Architecture it's my responsibility

522
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
Imagine all the possible

523
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,736
Disaster does it became this not-so-healthy

524
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Occupational obsession

525
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Y

526
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
That's good for us

527
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Let me tell you something

528
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
I'm probably getting some of these details are on but

529
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
My grandfather

530
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Clarence

531
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Balky

532
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Wasn't metallurgy

533
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Is true

534
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
Had something to do with

535
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,288
Building the atomic bomb and so does my uncle

536
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
And

537
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
My mother was

538
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
Quite traumatized by being a

539
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Daughter of

540
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
The bomb source

541
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Distance

542
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Became part of the family Legacy

543
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Maybe

544
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
When did way into his psyche

545
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Poisoned his work

546
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
Oh that's just the way

547
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
I registered it

548
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,304
I underworld trying to basically trying to say was that I was not really happy

549
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
He is an architect

550
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,936
Anyway that summer 1984 my little daughter Kayla

551
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Who was 1 and 1/2

552
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,824
Saw a man blowing bubbles with one of those little Dime Store watch and

553
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
She was just

554
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
Transfixed

555
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Transported to another Realm

556
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
And so says from that point on

557
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
We were always blowing bubbles

558
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,720
All kinds of small bubbles medium ones large when he says pretty quick he started to wonder

559
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
How can we make you fall asleep

560
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
Kiwi Hues so you know we cut out the ends of

561
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
The coffee can help dip when it in the soap

562
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Glue to the other

563
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Maybe a bubble that might be

564
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,336
Foot foot in diameter tried getting a coat hanger and bench

565
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
Do a circle dipping that into

566
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Do a frying pan full of soap

567
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
It was that you can make a bubble Maybe

568
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,600
Truth or Dare or something your daughter getting more and more excited as the bubbles get bigger is this about you

569
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
She was getting kind of bored with it

570
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Actually Dave started to get a little upset

571
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Yes that's

572
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
True

573
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
And I was thinking

574
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,680
Yeah this is an interesting design problem maximizing the size of a bubble

575
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
How you go about initially thought was

576
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,800
This is kind of everyone's thought when they

577
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Start thinking about the

578
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
You just need a bigger Circle

579
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
A bigger hoop through wish to blow the bubble

580
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,296
Like a hula hoop with a handle on it and you would need a little one for solar Plastics

581
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Swimming pools

582
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Full of bubble soap with starts

583
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Seemed kind of like

584
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Soprema design perspective

585
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
How do you scale that up

586
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,512
You can't just keep making the hoop and bucket bigger

587
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
That seems crazy

588
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
So at that point I was sort of

589
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
Stuck at whatever he was going on with his life designing buildings

590
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,008
But then he says one day in the summer of 1984

591
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
I was

592
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
Lying in bed

593
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
One morning I can still remember the

594
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Pattern of

595
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Fractions

596
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
See the idea hit him like a ton of bubble-shaped

597
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,552
Why not have a collapsible

598
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
I

599
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Sort of instantly saw his

600
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Sing in my mind it

601
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
It was what we now know as

602
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
The bubble bubble

603
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
And so

604
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,072
I hate leaps out of bed heads to the hardware store buys his stuff

605
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
And I bought

606
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
The doll and the chain in the vast

607
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
Freetone start assembling the device

608
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,032
And what were you and your kitchen where were you when you were doing we don't do this

609
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,616
You stepped outside and what he had in his hands

610
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
Was really nothing more than like

611
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Stick with a loop of chain

612
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
And one of the loop

613
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
Slide up and down on this

614
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
So that you could expand

615
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
In collapse the loop

616
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,024
That's the beauty of this design to have that control and be able to close

617
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Back in the backyard

618
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Close to Luther it was just like a

619
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Record like

620
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Straight cord

621
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,496
I dumped it in the bucket of soap I raise it up I open the loop

622
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Right away this huge

623
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Bubble

624
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Starts

625
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,944
Coming out tube stretches for 7 8 ft

626
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
He's not sure

627
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
But at a certain point he closes the loop

628
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Pinch It Off

629
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
And now it's a free-floating bubble

630
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
And it's sailing way over there

631
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
Over the Housetop and through the fog

632
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Tell me there's a

633
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Gigantic bubbles floating away

634
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
Biggest bubble ever

635
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Loan

636
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
I believe since it was somewhere between the size of a

637
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Refrigerator in a car

638
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
Iridescent is wobbly

639
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
And then suddenly

640
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
What did you feel in that moment

641
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,040
Bring your doctor Frankenstein who would just let this monster out in the world

642
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Hi I got this

643
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
Cold thrill going down my spine I'll never forget

644
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
Desi sent more and more of these

645
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Into the air

646
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,584
Pretty soon people started arriving in their cars and trucks

647
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,656
Everybody was

648
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Totally astonished

649
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,800
I thought this might be my ticket

650
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
How to draw architecture

651
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,968
So day was able to patent the bubble thing made enough money to get out of Arkham

652
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,576
And in the process he transformed bubble-blowing for the thing that just like

653
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Kids do

654
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,952
Kind of sport where you have like bubble athlete

655
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
My name is Gary Pearlman all over the world in Mexico they call me

656
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,728
I currently am the champion the heavyweight the big boy people are playing like really big

657
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
You can picture to 18 wheelers stacked on top of one another that's about how big

658
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
The bubble was

659
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
That's a slight exaggeration but anyways

660
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,528
There are debates going on about what kind of soap to use

661
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Which is the best

662
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Polymer to add to that so

663
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
And what kind of

664
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Fabric to use for the loop

665
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
But despite all this experimentation

666
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,304
Pretty much everyone uses a variation of Dave's original idea

667
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,912
Read these people are sort of my followers you see I find it very interesting

668
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
That you had this fear of your buildings collapse

669
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
I'm sure you go into this world where

670
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
All of the things you're making are meant to

671
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Collapse

672
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Well that here's the thing

673
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
It's true that every bubble will

674
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Collapse

675
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
But there's no blame

676
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Nobody got hurt

677
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
I think we might be able to get

678
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
I'm here

679
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
So that night Dave took me out Bubba

680
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,264
Baking powder we have thermometer we have test

681
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
Strips for measuring pH humidity

682
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,456
Settings okay but the wind is so amount of wind is usually very difficult. So good

683
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
So we'll go down and try to find some

684
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
Shelter gets around the corner

685
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
Of what West End

686
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
106 to EUR

687
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Midnight in Manhattan

688
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Pretty much empty

689
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Couple cars

690
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Almost no one walking

691
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
So now I'm going to

692
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
Junket in the show

693
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
And now I'm going to raise it up

694
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
And I'm going to open the loop and I'm going to see if I can make

695
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
Pretty good

696
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
It is

697
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Sailing along

698
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
Into the intersection and

699
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
The bubble is not chasing the taxi

700
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
That's about

701
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
The size of a

702
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Killer whale

703
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Maybe 20 feet long

704
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
When you get these giant bubbles

705
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Sailing around

706
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Buildings

707
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
It activates the

708
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Space he says it seems to transform the architect

709
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,752
It definitely did

710
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Like I made this city

711
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
Look Suddenly Beautiful and

712
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
A lava lamp

713
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,760
Alien and we got some people I can buy that are now taking videos of them

714
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Look at that one

715
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Oh that's a great one

716
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
That's that's the size of a smallish baby elephant Maybe

717
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,024
Okay and the taxi is now just done a U-turn to watch sncf

718
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
We got we got a bike messenger

719
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,960
Who's rubbernecking is even at midnight an audience with material

720
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,312
It just incredible like everybody okay New Yorkers are assholes

721
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
And people are stopping

722
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
Richmond

723
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
Stopping with smiles

724
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,552
We could detect he had just stopped in the middle of the road to watch you do this

725
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Zoe

726
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,464
Do you often stop your taxi to look at a to look at things

727
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Before

728
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
This is our life like this

729
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
It's so silly write it very silly

730
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Very wonderful

731
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
Is vacated

732
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Yeah that's

733
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
The size of a killer whale for sure

734
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
Do you ever feel silly out here

735
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
I

736
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Sometimes too but

737
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
I also sometimes

738
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
