Good job

Go to college

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
Can a plane get a bank account or boat

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
This is the

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,240
The story of a woman who became sort of famous

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Wish myself

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824

00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176

For having no identity whatsoever

21

Please contact me

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Story comes to us

24
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Our reporter Alexandria

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
And the young woman at the Centre of the story

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,632
I was born in Texas is Alecia Faith Pennington

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Cuz by faith

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
In

29
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
Brian Houston and then we moved to Kerrville

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
When I was real little like I don't even remember Houston at all she grew up in a really small town about 45 minutes outside of Santa

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
Antonio and it's kind of country we live right outside of Kerrville actually

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
So it was even more

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
In a country that Kerrville is

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
These parents were very conservative very religious

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
And they had created a place for their family that was

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Separate from

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
The rest of the world

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Well hi there

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Welcome to the Pennington point

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm Lisa

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
I just wanted to

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
How to say a quick hello

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
His mom Lisa actually kept a video blog of life in the Pennington family

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Birds are singing

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,992
So peaceful out here in the country so we had like like 5 acres of land

46
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
This is our front porch we bought this old farmhouse

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
About 10 years ago

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
We had a little home Farm

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
We had

50
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Goats chickens

51
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512
We had rabbits at one point

52
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
A cow that we would like raise

53
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
You know we butcher it and then freeze it all to me and then heated over the year

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
I just sort of approaching self-sufficiency or was it was it

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Reach that self-sufficient point

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
But they also we wanted to give you something their kids

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,296
Duties and responsibilities

58
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
We had a chart

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
The kid's name

60
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
How many of those how many of you were there

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
9 children Grace

62
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Jacob

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
Hope faith patience don't Adam Legend Levi

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Got that done.

65
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
Where were you in the

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Pecking order

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
4th in the middle

68
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Middle child syndrome

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
And Herb

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Parents

71
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Is Faith a word

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Kind

73
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
But very

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Farm

75
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
Very strict lot of rules for how you're supposed to dress and how you're supposed to look high school

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Educate yourself what were some of those rules

77
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,208
For the girls you had to wear dresses

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
Was super high collars we always wear sleeves no sleeveless

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
Kind of Amish but not like that conservatives

80
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
And

81
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
We all had a really really really long hair we didn't cut her hair and we just didn't have a lot of access to things that they didn't want us to have access to

82
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,384
I'm going to turn into like you were like 18 and could get on the allowed on internet for like limited

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Sight and stuff

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
What about television did you guys have that no other kids watch television

85
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Electronic

86
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Satan 2

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
Not have as much of a passion for Learning and working

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
And their Bible reading

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
I didn't get to watch a lot of movies growing up they only listen to Christian music

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Cool or what how did that

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
All home-schooled

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Every single one

93
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Does that mean that you were like

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Always on the

95
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
On the property or

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Go to church off and on

97
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Various times so

98
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
We go out for that custofab

99
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Super rarely like we did

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
I love the time you were with your family

101
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
I was just kind of a moral thing like

102
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
We are trying to

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Keep you

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Holy

105
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
I think

106
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
They

107
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Just

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Wanted to

109
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Keep playing

110
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
The things that they thought were like

111
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Sinful in the world

112
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
Away from their kids

113
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,711
And try to keep them safe and everything so if you said I want this they would say no and they win

114
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,319
Yeah arguing was not allowed but face actually

115
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Should I just kind of

116
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Pushing that line just a little bit I am definitely a lot more stubborn and a lot more free-spirited and

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Right around her 18th birthday ideas

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
I don't know I reached a point like a Breaking Point

119
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
With brushing like a little family meeting and I was

120
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
4 oldest

121
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
Siblings of my parents were kind of supposed to discuss things and then

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,943
My oldest sister asked my mom she was considering getting a job and kind of asking advice or permission

123
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
If she couldn't

124
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
The Rings are too much outside influence but she was 23

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Yeah

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,695
And then my brother said he wanted more internet because he was doing work for a church

127
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,071
And they're like I'm sorry we can't do that you know you could be looking at things online you know we just need to shut it off

128
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Github

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
The one that's right next to me to 21 mm for a phone my parents are like

130
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
No telephone

131
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
And so I was just like wow

132
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,359
And I'm looking at my other siblings and they have nothing ahead of them

133
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
When I allowed to get jobs

134
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
I like to go to school

135
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
They have no life except living here on this little farm

136
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
They have no future

137
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
After that night I decided I couldn't live like that

138
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
I couldn't

139
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
I was not going out like that

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
So

141
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
I had an iPod

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
And

143
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
I went on my parents room and I snuck

144
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,655
My mom wasn't there and I snuck my grandpa's phone number in Cincy an iPhone I could text him over Wi-Fi from

145
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
My iPods

146
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
I did and I said hey when y'all come visit next weekend

147
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
I want to go back with you

148
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
I need help I need to get away from here can you take me back

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Home with you and

150
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
He said he would

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
So Grandma is not a bone of the same mind as your folks

152
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,159
They weren't really on board with how my parents did things

153
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
But they always kept coming to see us

154
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
That's why I knew that they cared about me

155
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
And so I felt safe

156
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
To reach out to them

157
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
So the next week

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
Her Grandpa and her grandma show up

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
Farm and

160
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
What week

161
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Bolt how you going to do this

162
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Expendables

163
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
I don't want to go

164
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
But my grandpa was like

165
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
You need to ask them first need to ask permission

166
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
So I did and then

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
They

168
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Said no you can't go with them

169
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
And then so I was like okay

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Could I couldn't argue

171
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
And then

172
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
I said

173
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,631
Are they approached my grandparents broken necks and you still want to go or

174
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
And if I decide that I did

175
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
As far as you know you're the only one so far in this family has

176
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
It might

177
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Dyrdek

178
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
On this is convect

179
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
I know it

180
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919

181
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Anything like that in

182
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Our family before

183
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
So

184
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Text morning

185
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
September 24th 2014

186
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,255
My mom was on her morning run and my dad was in his office he said was always there working in the morning

187
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
In the house

188
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
To my grandparents have to buy the rest of the kids and I just walked out the door with them

189
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Luggage rack

190
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
What's your weakness one suitcase

191
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,127
My my grandpa texted my mom and was like we're taking Faith with us just wanted you to know

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,455
And then my mom texted and said don't go anywhere yet I'm coming back

193
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
She texted my dad and then they they both came and

194
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
Tried to get me to get out of the car

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,767
They're like you have to have the car as I don't have to like what yeah you have to cuz we're telling you to Mike Will

196
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
So they got in

197
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
And

198
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Thanks yes my grandparents to get out

199
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
They're like can you get out of the car and we'll get in so we can talk to her

200
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,079
So you were alone in the car with your parents then that's then all the all the safety goes away right here

201
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
The only thing I had on my thighs that I was buckled in the

202
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Car and refuse to get out

203
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
I think they were just kind of

204
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Shocked

205
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
I was so torn

206
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
I I mean I felt like I was just

207
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Melting

208
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
What was it that kept you in

209
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,119
I think I was just telling myself over and over that I knew it was the right thing to do

210
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Even though I didn't feel like it

211
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
I

212
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Had to take

213
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Control my life

214
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
And Amber wildee

215
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
Migraine pressure like we have to go like we need to leave out and sew

216
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
They left

217
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Just drove away

218
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
So this world like this is

219
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
This is what 8 people that you ate + 2

220
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
10 people that you are

221
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Reminder world

222
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Like

223
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Yeah

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
I was astonished that she had the boldness to

225
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Carry out that plan

226
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
This is Jenny L&S face and her mother's sister who like her grandparents didn't really subscribe to the Pennington

227
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
10 worlds you

228
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
But she would visit them from time to time at the Farm Heroes

229
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
For face

230
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
It's even more than just

231
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
The boldness of leaving her family

232
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
She believed she was walking into this world that was bad.

233
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Potentially going to

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Harm her

235
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
So that first night she gets to my parents house my grandparents said you can sleep in this room and there's a TV

236
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,727
The guest room Tulsa remote and leave her alone and said whatever you want

237
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
She never been allowed to

238
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
Kicker on TV shows and Sochi

239
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
She turns it on

240
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
You looking for

241
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Full sun and she said it was like a

242
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,159
Gardening show or a Home Improvement show or something and she's sitting there thinking I don't know if this is bad

243
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Exactly

244
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Portland Water

245
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
Chevy watching this cuz that's kind of my parents did their what they would come dictate was right I was wrong and I went somewhere distant okay that's wrong

246
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
That's right

247
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
And now that moral compass

248
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Was gone

249
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
She suddenly wasn't sure what was going to want

250
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
What about anymore

251
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
I am so tired

252
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Tired of the way we

253
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,783
And 19 is a tough place to step into the world being that naive

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Yeah she's asking me about sex

255
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
How do you learn what are you I don't know anything

256
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
I thought I knew

257
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
What kind of man

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
I didn't know anything

259
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
Even the most basic social norms supposed to act

260
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
When she's hanging out with her cousin or other people her own age I don't know what I'm supposed to talk about I didn't catch most like the reference

261
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Do they make all these other

262
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,895
Teenagers would be talking about shows music

263
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Movies school face

264
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
I had no idea

265
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
She wanted to join this world we all live in an even in the most simple ways she wanted to get a job

266
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
When to drive have an apartment

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
But

268
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
She couldn't

269
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
She didn't have course have a driver's license

270
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
No plus she didn't have it

271
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
Social security number

272
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
Have the birth certificate will you were born when you were born didn't they say okay was just the hospital will

273
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
The hospital Saul home birth

274
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
They specifically sought out midwives

275
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
That would

276
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Agree to file no Wrecker

277
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Why would you want to do that

278
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
There's two

279
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Hole

280
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Kind of way of thinking is called

281
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
What's it called

282
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,695
Sovereignty to take some of these documents as they exist

283
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
I've got hooks in them

284
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
So as I dug into the story I actually talked to a bunch of people who the birth certificate seemed like

285
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Like a paper of ownership

286
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Political or religious or just privacy reasons don't want this kind of documentation from the gov

287
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,151
Definitely been used for the measure of control

288
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Face parents who actually wouldn't talk to me for the story they're not supposed to be a part of that movement but my dad

289
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Some of those ideas

290
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
That

291
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
The government should not have a number assigned about they purposefully raised faith and her eight siblings to be

292
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Outside of the system and that's

293
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Probably something they thought of as a gift

294
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
I guess the thinking is that face would be

295
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Free from the rules of

296
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Society really my parents

297
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Stay but they did it out of like

298
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
The best they thought they

299
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
To do so I mean I'm not going to

300
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Emagine buddy for doing what

301
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
They think they should do

302
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,831
But to face it didn't feel like Freedom it actually felt like prison

303
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
And this is where face Journey really began

304
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Bass and her aunt or Grandma they went online started poking around and you realize

305
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
Was it the first thing you need is a birth certificate yes

306
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
She's applied to the Bureau of Vital Statistics government office where they keep track of like births deaths

307
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Marriages adoption in the Bureau of Vital Statistics does a search not only a vet name but if any light

308
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Django babies born in that area and make sure that you weren't stolen at Birth from some of their parents or something like

309
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
But they couldn't find anything so they said the next step is to go to court so my mom can't

310
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
Text the court and they wanted three pieces of information proving her birth facts

311
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
Well there was a sworn affidavit by my mother a swearing that she was at her birth we got that one

312
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
So they needed two more documents she could get a doctor's records

313
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
But

314
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
She doesn't have any government Hospital

315
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
They said she's never been that sick never even had an accident and they're better than us

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
Records I never even set foot inside of school savings account

317
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
Bank account without a social what about immunizations my dad was super against all that one of the

318
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Court Clerk's asked if she'd ever been baptized cuz the certificate that you get when you're baptized in a lot of churches can

319
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Work as one of the three pieces of evidence

320
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Okay but it turns out the baptismal record didn't have her birthday on it so it didn't count

321
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,743
Did you ever go to the library and get a library card you can get library card without an ID

322
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,583
Did you ever get an email address to your name at your parents house

323
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Yes

324
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
But it was all in your handwritten stuff

325
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
It doesn't count

326
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
So you have to go to the judge and say what what do you say to the judge

327
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
Well the judge won't listen he just said we're not going to hear the case because you don't have enough to even for me to even consider cuz you have to

328
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
I have some kind of Records you don't have enough proof

329
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,063
So you're sitting there the table there's a lawyer sitting there opposite and you and you sing so so

330
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
I know I was

331
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
I believe that I am this age

332
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
I was born

333
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
In my

334
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
House

335
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Add second section address

336
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Now what do we do

337
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
He looks at you and says what she looks even says

338
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,215
I've never seen this before she seemed people undocumented but not

339
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,847
Someone born in this country and visible to the states in the federal government

340
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Whip It Up

341
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
If you're born in America you are not automatically a citizen so shouldn't that I mean it's not like when you're born there's like this hey

342
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
Halo floating over your house just letting everyone know

343
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
You have to prove it

344
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
Where they could she get a

345
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
An immigration attorney that won't no not really because when an immigrant comes here from another country they

346
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
They have this country of origin

347
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,263
And for face in the eyes of the government she has no country of origin

348
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
They just think of her as being from nowhere

349
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
So I wasn't just like I was stuck

350
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
That's weird he called everyone we could not

351
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
Get help and we get like a little bit of allelic mean it as a work

352
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,647
We go up we talk to somebody or we fill out a paper we mail something every call somebody or something

353
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
And just like you rejected every time

354
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
You know it just looked hopeless is made me feel like

355
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
SNF

356
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
Happen you know it got to the point where when she was at parties or just talking to people about her

357
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,007
Situation what are you do I say how I don't exist

358
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,847
What kind of start this like weird conversation and it would actually start a lot of Commerce

359
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Games for other people

360
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175
And it would kind of help me to like

361
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Navigate stop

362
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
And so I actually kind of

363
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Help me figure out how to

364
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Socialize

365
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
This funny little things you could say

366
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
But when she was alone

367
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
It wasn't funny at all

368
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,303
I went through a really dark time during that I went through a lot of depression

369
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Depression manifest in you what

370
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Happened to you

371
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
I was not self harmful but I was

372
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Having a lot of suicide

373
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
My tomatoes are now almost like I don't even now

374
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
It's just

375
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Felt like I was

376
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Just floating in life

377
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
In the middle of just

378
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
See if there's so much stuff

379
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
You know I didn't know who I was

380
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
I have like I didn't exist at all

381
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back

382
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751

And I'm here because I need your help

389
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,423
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

390
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
Aunts and uncles teachers

391
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
We're looking for stories about what we're calling

392
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
Basically I want to hear about this

393
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
I kid you know did something

394
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
It just means you lean back and say

395
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Wow

396
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month

397
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Started reading

398
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Back to you

399
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
Or maybe the kid was a piano

400
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,559
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

401
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Or maybe the kids in math

402
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
Music in the margin of their geometry

403
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
We're interested in the

404
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Specific moments where

405
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
Kid does something super smart

406
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
It doesn't have anything to do with it

407
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
If you have a story

408
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455

Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab today the story of a woman who became famous for

415
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
Being intimately invisible

416
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
So

417
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
She decided that the only solution

418
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
My name is Alecia Faith Pennington

419
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
And I'm US citizen by birth to make this video I was bored at home

420
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
And my parents neglected to file breaker 2

421
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Advocate for birth record of any kind

422
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
She just figured I was homeschooled my entire life

423
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
But have no school records

424
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,703
Maybe there's somebody out there that has no done this before so I was like well

425
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Give a shot I want

426
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Travel I want to get

427
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
I want to just be a phone

428
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
American

429
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
But I can't until I can play

430
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,991
If you've been through a similar situation or know anyone who can help

431
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Please contact

432
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
She put it up on YouTube and

433
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Then

434
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
That was it

435
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,927
Expect anyone to watch it

436
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
But

437
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
My phone was just like notification after notification it was like

438
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Ding a ding a ding

439
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,751
In the first week at over 1.2 million views like

440
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
I hadn't even like been on YouTube before that let alone like

441
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Posted a video so it was crazy it went up on Reddit Twitter the friend of

442
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Snapchat daily

443
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,855
People just couldn't believe it they were like can this seriously happen it just

444
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Took off and then she just starts getting all these

445
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Email it was

446
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,023
Is saying I was getting literally two emails every single second that's not an exaggeration

447
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
I couldn't keep up with it like I could not read all of them coming from like Germany and Israel Africa

448
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Worldwide

449
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
And what were people saying what did they email you about

450
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
Oh all kinds like I was not only touched by your screen presence but I'm also very infuriating frustrated by the circuit

451
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
I actually sat down with faith while she read through bunch of these emails

452
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Hello I'm very intrigued by your story book really 23 from homeschoolers Louisiana my name is Jose from the children

453
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Turn up immigrants who felt like a scent

454
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,327
Solidarity I commend you for that but a lot of it was and I pray that you were able to get the documents

455
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,935
You need some kind of encouragement saying I don't know how to help you but I just want you to know I'm rooting for you

456
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Like don't give up

457
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
What did it look like today

458
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
To have eyes on you in that way

459
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
It was

460
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Really empowering

461
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
I didn't

462
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
It was a very confident in who I was

463
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
So Jess

464
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
To have

465
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,111
So many people be like we're behind you. It felt really good

466
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
To be recognized

467
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
A little bit

468
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
But at the same time it

469
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Kind of made her

470
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,584
More famously that woman who doesn't

471
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
Exist the girl with no identity

472
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,496
And it didn't even solve her problem because when people did offer advice

473
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:37,152
Didn't really help start working on not paying taxes I'll come to you I got people who just had them ideas of what to do

474
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
So you can gain citizenship many of them more marriage proposals

475
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
Actually that will help

476
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Some of them not so

477
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
Set alarm

478
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
Also inside of those emails in comments

479
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,704
There was a conversation about whether what her parents did was right on his from like the opposite perspective

480
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,592
David says her parents didn't quote neglect anything they stood on an exercise their rights and wisely so

481
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
What they did was in her best interest she just doesn't understand it because she is young and she's led a protective life a lot of these folks

482
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Spelt like Faith was blowing this

483
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Gifts that her parents

484
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Giving her

485
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:23,744
From my perspective if you take some of these documents as they exist

486
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
I've got hooks in them

487
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
This is Alfred Addis

488
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
Who blogs about sovereignty and sovereign state

489
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Kristoff

490
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Mystic give you a little bit of a

491
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Evidence that maybe I'm not crazy

492
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
There's a case called Chisholm vs. Georgia

493
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,968
41793 they're talking about European jurisprudence

494
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Distinction between the prince

495
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
And the subject

496
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,928
And the distinction is that the prince gets his rights from Ghana that's when they say the king is Anointed

497
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,328
Happy message ideas obtained he

498
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,680
Hear meaning within the United States of America after revolution

499
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,008
The sovereignty devolved on the people

500
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
And they

501
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Are the truth sovereign

502
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
And the word sovereigns is

503
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,784
Alexandra how do you deal with the opening phrase

504
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Raisin in the Constitution which is

505
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,160
We and people not I the person one by one

506
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
But we

507
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
When it says we the people it means we the sovereign

508
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,144
Are not a collective

509
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,240
You are an idiot we ended up getting into the the little tussle over the world

510
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Government disability

511
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
And the car

512
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,896
Tuition but eventually we got back to face

513
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,224
Once you have been recognized as a sovereign

514
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
How do you avoid it's like in Redondo long just I want

515
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,136
Judge I don't want blue eyes anymore

516
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,280
If you must part of you must go out and feel a little sorry for her right like she she's got it she has

517
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
A

518
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
She has a a will to become something other than cousin will to become a subject subject

519
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Yes

520
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
So you going to but I don't hear you condemning her

521
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Oh you are condemning her that little bit

522
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Is making a choice

523
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
There's Proviso in the Bible where people in the Old Testament if you wanted to remain you could be you could volunteer to be a slave for some guy

524
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
Some people don't want to be sovereign

525
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,048
It's not an email I just want a job if you want to work for a living

526
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,400
There are consequences for her abandoning her status as a free woman

527
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
Here's the weird irony

528
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,264
Because she has no birth certificate because she has no passport

529
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,920
The state of Texas in the government United States Sabo we can't figure out how to make you visible again

530
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
They may not be able to

531
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
But then

532
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:59,136
Face grandmother lives in my district in Sun City and she the government stepped in my grandma was able to

533
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,720
Get in touch with Marsha Farney Marsha Farney state representative

534
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
I have house district

535
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
She's a republican member of the Texas House of Representatives we would get together I do with my staff and say what are the cause of headache

536
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
I come in this week

537
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
And this one will really

538
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Caught our attention

539
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
So she heard about it she said when you do something about this

540
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
And she did

541
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
This pill

542
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Is anesthesia

543
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
To get

544
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
A birth certificate

545
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
Around a month after face video went viral Marsha Farney put together a bill and brought it before the House of Representatives in

546
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Standard committee

547
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Already read

548
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
About this bill and Bear

549
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Keenly aware

550
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,840
So the bill does a couple things it makes the process logistically easier

551
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Expanded

552
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,472
Where a someone could apply for a delayed birth certificate it was

553
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,568
Punishments for the parents so in the case of Faith right if she asked her parents

554
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,456
For documentation and they refuse then it's punishable by up to a year in jail and up

555
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
2

556
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,832
$4,000 of a fine or a combination of both

557
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
Germano bail for Witnesses here who want to testify on this bill during the kind of way

558
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
That the various sides High

559
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,608
I'm Lucy Southworth live in Georgetown Texas

560
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
And so faith and her aunt and her grandma all went to test

561
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,520
If I face is my granddaughter in my namesake

562
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
I was in the room the day she was born

563
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Unfortunate

564
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
Her grandma filled in the state reps on what they've been doing the last six months we went to the DPS to get her a driver's license and

565
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
They said no they said go to the social

566
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,416
Security people security people said no go to the voter registration p

567
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,280
Meetings and dead-ends and rejection go to the DPS

568
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
We were stuck in a do Loop

569
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
Well I wasn't going to quit their for goodness sake she's a text

570
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
So Marsha Farney has offered us

571
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
Our only hope we have had since this started

572
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
I just hired you to pass this

573
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Spell

574
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
Take face out of limbo

575
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Give her the life she

576
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
My view was just like we would not allow a parent

577
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
The physically handicapped a child

578
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,904
We should not allow a parent to handicap a child

579
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,488
Where they can't operate and function in society

580
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Although You Seen Her Standing

581
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Anon person

582
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Chicken Walk

583
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Off the face of the Earth

584
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
And legally nobody would know

585
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
She was gone

586
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
I think the bills a little misguided that's James Pennington face dad he came out to the hearing and ended up on the

587
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
The Fox 7 news cast

588
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:38,368
And unfortunately this is the only bit of tape we have of him

589
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Fees for prostitute already there

590
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
There are six other

591
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Children seem a little

592
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
I think I don't disagree with that does the State of Texas want to put start putting

593
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Aaron's in

594
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,960
Well the bill gives the judge some leeway based on what the circumstances are for the parents

595
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,824
But we we felt there was a need for some teeth to this bill

596
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
Duke and it turns out that the Texas

597
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,992
State house and state senate agreed so we were able to get it through the house and the Senate

598
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:10,880
The bill ended up passing Republicans voted for it Democrats voted for it there's actually only one no vote

599
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:16,000
But the next time Marshall funny was up for re-election she actually lost in the primaries

600
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,888
And according to the Texas Observer who actually did a really nice podcast if a story

601
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,288
There's this lobbying group called the Texas homeschool Coalition who donated a bunch of money to find his primary opponent

602
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Parental Revenge

603
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
Okay well then what's the weirdest videos that leafy

604
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,320
Well because of the bill Faith was able to take her case to a different Court a higher Court

605
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,976
And it seems like the bill allowed the judge to consider different kinds of evidence so in the end Faith with Abel

606
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
Will use an old orthodontist record and a piece of paper

607
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
From her uncle a doctor

608
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Who had treated her toe back when she was a kid

609
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
And in just a couple weeks

610
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
This is

611
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Certificate

612
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
Sometimes I just take it out and look at it

613
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Sometimes randomly

614
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
I know it sucks it's so dumb it's like

615
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
I have one too

616
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,320
Can you read it to me a little bit like what's up what information is on here

617
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,928
It has my name at the top and it has like my description

618
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
My sex

619
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Where I was born

620
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
County

621
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Counting to the singer

622
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm hoping that the physical papers

623
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Can like mirror

624
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
The emotional thing that she's going through cuz I feel like

625
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
It's like a she's getting the papers she's appearing

626
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:48,416
So that by the time she gets that last one she will know who she is and then she will be that person whoever that is

627
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
She's working so hard for it

628
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm hoping that

629
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Adjust

630
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,120
That will have developed in her something that she feels like it's more than a piece

631
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
You know

632
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
I'm hoping

633
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
So now Faith

634
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
She was actually able to get a driver's license

635
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
But she still doesn't have her social security number

636
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:15,040
Which means you can't get a real job she can't open up a bank account still really

637
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,648
But she can't get health insurance she might not be able to go to college

638
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
So

639
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
I don't know what's going to happen to her

640
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,328
I remember asking her this question like when this is all over

641
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Do you know who you're going to be

642
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
You know

643
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,448
Cuz now this is who you are you're the girl with no identity

644
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
And

645
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
She was

646
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,544
A little concerned that she wouldn't know who she was going to be

647
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,896
If your if your aunt ask you that same question again like

648
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,712
Who do who do you think you are now who Do You Think You Are

649
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,832
What how would you answer that now

650
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
I don't know like

651
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
I just feel like me

652
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Like

653
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
I'm just

654
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
You take to report a producer Alexander young is pieces also produced by Brenna Farrell and Andy Mills and we had

655
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
A lot of help from a lot of Texans

656
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
I should say

657
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
I think I must be texting Savannah Escobar Rachel Coleman David Glenn Chris Van Dusen

658
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,144
Russell Whelen Liberty consultant Nick read the group homeschool alumni reaching out and

659
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912

Zipline Adventure

661
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,312
Speaking of that last one I should say when I went to go visit face in Austin

662
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,384
She's got green hair now she's got

663
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,784
A nose ring and a tattoo when she goes home from time to time and actually visited with her mom on Mother's Day

664
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
But when I was there she wanted to do something with me that she's never done before

665
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
I'm so excited you guys

666
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
So we decided to go zipline

667
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560

668
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352

669
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Happen to be called

670
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936

671
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,032
Davis Jack one last thing before we close

14 years

675
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
I've been working on radio

676
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
