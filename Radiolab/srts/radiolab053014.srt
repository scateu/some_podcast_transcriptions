1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,960
Listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,824
Radiolab WNYC

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,872
And NPR

4
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,736
Hey I'm Chad at 11 today

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,600
We're going to begin in a place Robert come in there

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,208
Oh my God a Place full of wonderful

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
Thinks it is the actual blood that Henson and Perry used to first go to the North Pole season 2 Pole

8
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,960
Aliens books and his Conquest to Egypt look at the antlers over there

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,080
Is the weight where I where are you by before I tell you explain something

10
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,664
My wife and I hate Kmart have been having an argument for roughly

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
What's going on at 40 years

12
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
It's always about

13
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Things

14
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
Like objects as you know

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
You ever think about things you give me an autograph I can Abraham Lincoln autograph I think okay

16
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
This very piece

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
You don't have to write your signature in this very way

18
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
He had to be standing exactly where I'm standing

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
And therefore he and I share this space I've literally believe that I am standing in a room

20
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
Abraham Lincoln Shadows

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Touch and Abraham Lincoln autograph

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Time travel

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
What form of love is all those things

24
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
And I can do that without even

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Blinking red

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Kmart not at all

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,392
But also represented the magic of it extends to

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
We were really really ugly

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
Floor lamp from a long time ago

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
And every time I would say

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Enough already let's go

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Get rid of it

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
It's older than me I've had it on my life

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,240
Which makes if you don't have that at all I don't have that

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
So

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,384
In honor of our topic today I decided that we going to settle this argument once and for all

37
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
I took Tamar to the Explorers

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
Wait what's 6 + Club

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Explorers deposit things that they collected everything in this building has some historical significance

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
That's will Roseman the executive director he gave us a tour

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
This is the actual Bell

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
From the SS Roosevelt when pairing Hanson first went to the North Pole

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
The chair over there

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Belong to the empress Dowager of China

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
The last emperor's wife

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Cheerleader

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
He points to it looks like a little desk

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
The empress Tarot

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,880
Picture of China satin it yeah that was her chair

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
Accident yesterday

51
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
She said

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Nothing

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,448
I just close your eyes and imagine that you are the last Empress skinny

54
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
Hugely long line of Chinese empresses going back

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Probably a thousand years

56
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
I would order them to make more comfortable

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
Just give it a chance

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
There's nothing that's going to seep into me

59
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
There isn't

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,208
I don't know man was never going to be easy at Kmart is a New York Times Reporter

61
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Very reasonable.

62
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Sensible

63
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,376
I was just a chair just the beginning I they have things in this place I was going to break her

64
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Step by step

65
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
We'll walk this to the next

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Do you snore

67
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Where they had

68
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Pieces of Fab

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
On display

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
Scraps of did you know early planes were made out of canvas

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
And these are actual pieces of those early playing

72
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
Here's the Wright brothers plane

73
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,624
What do you mean this is the fabric from the actual first absolutely

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
09

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,744
There was a small round piece of fabric not much larger than your fist

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Buzz cut

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
From the wing

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
A beer first airplane

79
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Sow the wind the wind

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Rush over that little piece of Amber

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah

82
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
Very cool very interesting

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Happiness is when you're standing next to the fabric that lifted into the sky for the first time in America

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
You don't feel

85
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
Did the top closer to a Bernardo right not even attached

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
What a wonderful collection how interest

87
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,976
That's amazing

88
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
Do I feel that no

89
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
So

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
I think it's something that

91
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
He's trying to pull out the big guns

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
I don't see how you can get bigger than what you already offered

93
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Maybe this will

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
Convince you

95
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Sports Club flag

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,159
That accompany Buzz Aldrin Neil Armstrong when they first landed on the moon in 1969

97
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511
So this is one of these three things

98
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
That that piece of cloth right there on the Moon by Neil Armstrong when he first

99
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Landed on the moon in 1969

100
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Oh my

101
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
It was in a little glass

102
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Box you could see is a

103
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
A royal blue

104
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
Explorers Club Factory small

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Probably made of silk

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,647
Yeah I can you know what I touch the flag that was the first tiger ever

107
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
Imma David Shuman calendar

108
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Emanation

109
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
Are you a specialist

110
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Yes yes

111
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Open up the cabinet

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
You know God it's in your hands

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
God dammit

114
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Is it

115
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
Very nice

116
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Feels like it's a Little Caesars on the moon brought there by the people who

117
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
From our planets

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
The first people ever to land on them

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
They brought this with them

120
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Okay Utah

121
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Well I'm done touch

122
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Pineal

123
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Andy Reddit

124
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
I mean I'm pretty pumped to touch it

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
Tamar you don't get any of this

126
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,695
I don't give a swoon

127
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,791
This is the first trip to the moon

128
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
I mean

129
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
I don't have it

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
I just I don't have

131
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
I got to go to work so I'm okay

132
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Thank you so much for coming

133
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
But maybe she just open to the Future doesn't want to have to carry all that bag messenger camera

134
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
You know you are going into a swoon about a lamp that's clearly an ugly ass lamp

135
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
What's up let's be available to the new lamps of the world I'm not going to admit

136
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Maven

137
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
Consider anything you just said except

138
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
That you're probably right about the future orientation every story that we have in this hours base

139
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
That argument you had with your wife

140
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,247
In story form

141
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
There's a thing

142
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
And the thing Beckett

143
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Or not today on Radiolab

144
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Everybody say something

145
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,911
Hello hello hello

146
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
Well we're talking about objects I believe yeah and I understand you guys are kicking around some ID

147
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
It is but it seems my ideas are in a bit of a different orbit than yours are maybe there's a connection

148
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
We have an orbit yet I think we've want

149
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,415
Okay so our first story comes from a TV producer Vin Liotta longtime TV Guide

150
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Coup

151
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Connected up with us because

152
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
Turns out he's making a documentary

153
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,631
About this very thing people's connection to objects

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
My interest in objects is

155
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Things that sort of him accidentally

156
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
Gotten meaning pravin even have a little scrap of something that's gone to the moon and back it's nothing compared to

157
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Rick Rollins

158
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Sugar egg

159
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,063
Rick Rollins acrylic Rollin Rick Ross

160
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Actually the story you want to tell us

161
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Had three part

162
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
It's about the candy egg a box

163
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
And to treat a candy egg a box

164
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
And the tree

165
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,887
So this is what I would suggest as I have some clips

166
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Short clips

167
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
And I'd like to sort of weed the clips together sort of get maybe throw it out that way rather than telling you about them

168
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
Why don't we why don't we try I see we're dealing with a storyteller

169
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,343
So let me just play a club is like a short clip this is just an intro to Rick

170
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111

Wow it's beautiful. The size of a shirt box

173
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
It's made out of maple very light in color it's very delicate

174
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Molded

179

Cigarettes

180
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Halo in a center

Light yellow

182
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
Something someone might eat

Hi

186
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
I saved it since 1971.

187
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Just getting to say

188
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
619 what is an Edible Egg this isn't an edible

189
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
If you kept it from 1970

190
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,215
It looks remarkably Good Samaritan dissolved in under the weight of time and it

191
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,615
And apparently it's a well it is pristine I've seen it I had a sugar egg

192
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
What is that

193
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
Only it's a half of an egg it's

194
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Halo it's made out of sugar and you would put things like jelly beans and if you seal the edges with

195
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Frosting and then you decorate the outside of it there must have been some reason why he

196
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
He has

197
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Memorialized

198
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm glad you mention it I just happen to have another clip 2

199
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,543
Day that we were to leave

200
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,175
I'm sorry. I didn't set it up because I'm going to have to say about Rick was when he was a kid

201
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
His family moved around a lot

202
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
There lyrics dad did a lot of work for the government so almost every year he would find himself in a totally different town and to make things worse

203
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Worse he was very shy

204
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Kid

205
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Kept himself a lot for Rick friendship

206
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
But just often seemed

207
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Impossible

208
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
But then says there was this one moment

209
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,471
When he was eight that they lived in Washington State

210
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Only four-year and

211
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,383
He found himself in the drama because he had finally made a friend

212
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
And his friend David

213
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
Invited him to a birthday party

214
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
But it happened to be

215
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
That his birthday party was scheduled the very day

216
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
That we were to move

217
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Again

218
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
So my father was once once again transferred this time from Washington back to Idaho and my parents are

219
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Decided that it

220
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
I couldn't attend the birthday party because there wasn't time

221
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
So

222
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
The moving van was sitting there everybody was ready to go and I don't think I even asked my parents I don't think they know

223
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
That I left

224
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
But I took off

225
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
And I ran up the street to David's house

226
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,367
I I still can't picture this moment I ate his house with a brick house and he had a

227
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
Large porch that was completely empty and I know that I paused there

228
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Even though I was

229
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Only eight

230
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
I must have known

231
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,447
That our friendship really wasn't at the point where it demanded a goodbye especially

232
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
If that meant that I had to interrupt

233
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
What is birthday party but I rang the doorbell

234
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
And his mother answered the door

235
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
And

236
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
I remember seeing

237
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
Basically from her knees down

238
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,271
And Beyond her into the back of the house which was bright

239
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And Loud where the party was going on

240
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
A few seconds later David showed up he and I was kind of behind her and I don't

241
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Never seen a word

242
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,167
You just standing I would just Frozen and standing there completely embarrassed and not knowing why I had done this

243
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
And

244
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
I was about to leave

245
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
When

246
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
David's mom

247
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
Apparently asked him to go get something and he left

248
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
A few seconds later returned and handed me

249
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
This yellow

250
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Sugar egg

251
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,463
The very same here in your box yes I

252
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
Walks back to my parents house

253
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
We were loaded into the back of

254
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Their station wagon

255
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,775
And we drove from there to Idaho and I know that I held this in my hand the entire way

256
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
Did let go of it

257
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
I put it in a drawer and it has lived in various places for all these years

258
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Why

259
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,183
Is it begs the question doesn't hit

260
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
You know the truth is

261
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,607
I knew its importance immediately and it hasn't changed I looked at this egg

262
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
And it was proof

263
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,287
Physical proof that I have been invited to a birthday party

264
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
And there was a hope of making a friendship

265
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
And

266
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,479
I held onto it because I needed that proof

267
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
That's actually very wonderful

268
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,191
The tree we need to we need entry of the heck I'm all about

269
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
I'm swept into the egg know I'm bring it together and I'll bring the narrative threads together a little more egg

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Give me more

271
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
The tree so my parents bought a home in Idaho this is right

272
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Left the egg incident in the Snake River Valley in Idaho it's it's very flat it's very we

273
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
Why their new backyard was a Barren landscape

274
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Trees pine trees cherry and amongst them was a maple tree

275
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
The groove very quickly and it enveloped to house in a certain way in the breeze sound like

276
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,783
Suede rub together just Amplified by

277
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
It was beautiful

278
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
Live there with his family for 10 years until College I moved to Boston and Byler

279
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Learned that my father decided that the tree was planted too close to the house and it would it would damage the foundation

280
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
And he dropped it down

281
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
It was a massacre it was it was brutal and

282
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
I was very upset

283
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
It's my mother knowing that she mailed me a package and I opened it to find that she had place

284
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
Christian it some small sprouted seedlings from the original maple tree

285
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
Backyard and plopped it in the ground behind the garage and it's arrived

286
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,543
And within a number of years it has grown to be a 30-foot tree

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Remind me obviously of the tree that I

288
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Had loved and lost

289
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
In Idaho

290
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
And

291
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
It became

292
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
So large unfortunately that also caught the attention of my landlord

293
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Tragically

294
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,767
One night I got back from work to discover that he had chop down

295
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,167
The maple tree

296
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
I went out into the yard that night

297
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
And I

298
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Salvaged these sections of the tree

299
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,479
Rick gave the wood to a friend of furniture maker in Gloucester Massachusetts turned it into a box

300
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
This box

301
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
One right here

302
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
Made from the maple That Grew From You know the story

303
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Wow there's discontinuity

304
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
I find such a comfort from that

305
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,095
So it intern holds all these objects that have their own individual stories and their own meaning

306
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
One of them is this yellow

307
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Sugar egg

308
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
The exit 3 in the Box

309
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,895
Yeah that's nice that's really nice I've been very nice you want to smack a little bit and be like

310
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
Well now you know

311
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,695
No not me we can put the Box in a house we made from the teeth of his dog with the thing

312
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,535
Thing I would say okay just keep multiplying

313
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Oh how I wish we left it there like you can't

314
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,335
Really experience them unless you touch them and interact with them like that's how you

315
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
Get the essence of what's in there

316
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
But at a certain point are producers in Levy really produce this show had this great idea for an experiment that we could do

317
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Where we would make 3D printed versions of the objects in the stories and then public exhibit where

318
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
People can come and see them while they listen to the audio or even if they have access to a 3D printer they could just print a verb

319
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
Persian wherever they are so we asked if we could scan the egg

320
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
He was game to a place that does that near him we ask him to bring his again

321
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Technician portal

322
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Scanner machine that takes like 360 degree images

323
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,159
A little bit of melted plastic and Wallah there it is

324
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
And here's what happened Rick

325
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,791
Drop the egg off Frisk and egg that have been cherishing for over 40 years

326
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,655
I had to leave it for a couple hours shortly after he does he gets a call

327
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
From the scanning technician who

328
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Towson

329
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Something

330
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Here she said

331
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
The bottom line is

332
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Yeah

333
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
The egg is broke

334
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
She said

335
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
I hope it wasn't a family heirloom

336
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,487
Finn met up with Rick as he was just getting back from the print shop with his bag

337
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Egg pieces I close the stuff that the

338
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Story didn't really even

339
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Look too much

340
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Oh my God

341
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Looks like it's

342
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
In about

343
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
7 pieces

344
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Plastic bag

345
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671

What happened I never had my heart

352
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Think in that way

353
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
From any emails I've ever opened

00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Thank you

Thank you it was such

356
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
It was such a strange

357
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Clash

358
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
To walk into this store that is devoted to the Future

359
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,255
And all these machines sitting around that are turning out

360
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Almost magically

361
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,655
These new things and I on the other hand and standing there

362
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
To collect

363
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
The shards of a sugar egg that I've held onto

364
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
440 + years and

365
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Just felt

366
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Dullness

367
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
Kind of heavy like everything was just a little bit

368
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Muddied

369
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
4

370
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
A while

371
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
It took a little while for that to wear off

372
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
And

373
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
And it did with an amazing

374
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Clarity

375
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
When worrying I think it was two days after the egg has been broken

376
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
He says he woke up and

377
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
And idea came to me

378
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
Thought I should call Max

379
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Sedition a

380
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
Max is the son of a friend of his who lives down the street

381
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
We do one

382
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Tablespoons in

383
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
He's eight

384
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,719
Exactly the same age that I was when I got the first egg

385
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
Of Yellowstone

386
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,471
And so I asked him if he would help me

387
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Recreate

388
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Fisher Greg

389
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Kind of

390
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Smiled and said

391
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
YouTube

392
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
I'm in there already

393
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Oyelowo

394
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Going right here

395
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Already finishing

396
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
All the one

397
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
I was

398
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Exactly your age

399
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Exactly

400
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
Special thanks to Vin Liotta Who provided us with much of

401
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
The tape you just heard

402
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
Rickon and will FEMA

403
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
The whole thing yeah he has doing a documentary what you guys got all that stuff about people who attach do everyday things O and A

404
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
And in terms of the

405
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
Did the egg breaking

406
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,336
We we actually we have we found somebody who doesn't like restoration

407
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Free movie stuff

408
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
And we've offered

409
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
Ric to to have that person fix the egg with epoxy or whatever an offer he agreed to accept

410
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
I'm happy to say

411
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
And also interestingly enough

412
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
Myths can hear the scan that broke the Agnew

413
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Actually

414
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
We have that scan

415
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,304
Is the skin skinny when she was actually running

416
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Very moment when the egg

417
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Broke

418
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
So we actually have

419
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,448
A scan of the millisecond when it fell apart

420
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Radiolab.

More information about Sloan at

425
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Www.

426
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Sloan.

427
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Oregon end of message

428
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,128
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

429
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:17,248
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

430
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

431
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,720
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

432
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,352
Childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

433
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

434
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,336
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

435
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

436
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,856
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

437
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

438
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,352
It doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

439
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

440
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
Record a short audio message for us

441
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,056
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

442
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Thank you so much

443
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
Okay I'm Jedi boom wrought iron rubber Co which is his Radiolab Wednesday

444
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
Things I wanted to check in this is the usual Radiolab style which it means that I can basically

445
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
Schnatter on forever

446
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
Fights this is Alison gopnik she's a professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley and the

447
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
The author of The philosophical baby

448
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
And the reason we call the Rob is that

449
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,552
Truthfully after the egg situation we Broken Egg to make this program and get food if you're just joining us

450
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Just happened with Phil really

451
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Crappy about it frankly but

452
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
Got us thinking about the fragility of

453
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
Of objects in for me that cult mind

454
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
And I do that I've always been thinking about

455
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,888
You have any father to young kids about object permanence

456
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,776
Which is this whole idea in child psychology that when babies are really young

457
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
When an object

458
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,848
Disappears from their View

459
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
They think it's gone forever

460
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,296
Sutherlands Topeka active you're gone forever

461
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,768
So I thought this would be a cool idea for us to explore about how like from the very beginning we're born with

462
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
No concept that objects that stick around but

463
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
Let me talk with Alison gopnik the first thing she told us

464
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,936
What's with that well it's

465
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
It's

466
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
It's a little more complicated than that

467
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Of course

468
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:55,200
Lawrence Wright that's science until we got to a conversation and some strange directions but she began by telling us about

469
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,064
Some new research which shows it actually babies do have an idea that objects

470
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Stick around

471
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,928
Yo if you do the experiments were you show him an object by the screen in The Matrix

472
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
Pier

473
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
Where did it go it should be there exactly

474
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
You know the well because babies look much longer at things that they don't expect it or surprising

475
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
You're saying you know

476
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
What's up

477
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,384
Very rarely finish that expression though

478
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Alright so I was wrong

479
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Here's the really surprising

480
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Now suppose what happens is

481
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Yellow duck goes behind the

482
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
Screen moving left right and then out the other side

483
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Dead of the yellow duck

484
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
There's a little blue bunny

485
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
No most adults if they saw this would be like

486
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
What's up

487
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
But the babies are totally blase about that

488
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
A yellow duck goes in one side of the screen and then magically the Blue Duck appears on the other side of the screen

489
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
Until they're about a year old babies don't seem to be

490
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Changed by that

491
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
And she suspects that the reason for that is that

492
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
The most important thing about the duck to the babies is not

493
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,856
That is yellow or round or duck like in any way it was

494
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,696
Its trajectory story what did in the past what its history is

495
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,048
Like this is an object that was moving left right and when it emerged from the screen

496
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:19,936
It was still an object moving left to right and there are experiments with adults that are kind of amazing

497
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,496
Do you sort of see the same thing

498
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Room full of students

499
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,872
Divide them in half you say okay everybody on the left half

500
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
The room

501
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,248
Is now going to get a univ University of California at Berkeley mug

502
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
Then you say to them all right

503
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,368
Oh you got to have a mug how much would you sell your mug for

504
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
And then you ask

505
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:44,768
The people on the other side of the class how much would you pay to buy that mug can you get people to write it down on a piece

506
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
Will it rain at the people who actually already have them on their desk

507
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,984
Think that it's much more valuable than the people on the other side

508
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
They would demand much more

509
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
For their mug

510
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
Keep in mind they only spent one minute with

511
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,968
This mug but somehow over that minute she says the mug gets imbued with something

512
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Some kind of

513
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
There's something and again you can see this even with children there's something about - there's something about possession about

514
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
A relationship that I have to be objects that I care about

515
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,096
It goes beyond just what their superficial features

516
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
That makes sense

517
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
Deeply obvious inst

518
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
I'm surprised that it was even a discovery

519
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
If I have a relationship with a thing

520
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Like I

521
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,896
I'm going to see my girlfriend and the

522
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Railroad man gives me the ticket

523
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
And it turns out to be

524
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Fabulous date

525
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,344
Can I put the ticket in my pocket and I saved it to get 40 years

526
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,904
Anytime I want to go back

527
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
To the day that I have the great date

528
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
I just touched

529
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
The ticket

530
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,376
Yeah I don't have that at all don't have it at all I have a little bit but now I

531
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
I throw that

532
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
You throw it away

533
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
I throw them away

534
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
The Purge man

535
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
If some of us are more sentimental about

536
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
About objects then

537
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Then others are and what you says

538
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
For those weirdos like you Robert

539
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Who gets super romantic about their

540
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Things

541
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
There might be a deep evolutionary reason for it

542
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Now yours to take these evolutionary reasons with a grain of salt but

543
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
She says if you look at

544
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
Patterns of

545
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
Cashing for example is what it's called in biology you have like the squirrel hides his nuts the squirrels keep really

546
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,984
Good track of which nuts they have and what their histories are

547
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
And one possibility is that some of our

548
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
Relationship about at least physical objects

549
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Stems from

550
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
This

551
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
The history of

552
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,576
History of being mammal to keep track of what we got and what we don't have

553
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
Yeah we do talk about people swirling things away is there something that's got this kind of deeper evolutionary background and

554
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
I think there is some evidence that

555
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
But it's also like a counter squirrel Instinct I mean like

556
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,728
There's that famous thing with observation that young male baboons when they get to a certain age

557
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,800
Gripped by Wanderlust and then just wander away from the truth

558
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
And which is good

559
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,408
Prevent inbreeding

560
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,248
Is actually reason to think that we all live on this kind of

561
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Emotional bungee cord

562
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
Yeah boy in between the score on the baboon and she says it

563
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
Interesting to think about like what's going to happen to her

564
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Bongino

565
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Now that we're entering a world where objects are

566
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Becoming

567
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Just information

568
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
What will happen when we have

569
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
3D printers

570
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
That are going to be like the replicators on Star Trek

571
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
They can

572
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
Just keep producing

573
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Replicas of

574
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
About you

575
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,640
Might actually mess with some of our most Basic Instinct philosophy

576
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Great about having wonderful crazy

577
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Thought experiment

578
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
What's the trade-in damaged

579
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
So one of them

580
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
The Swamp Man famous thought experiment

581
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
Mother got a man but here's the story of the Swamp Man matching you're standing next to swamp near you

582
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,496
I've been swamped a bunch of

583
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
Whatever you just standing there but that a bolt of lightning comes out of the sky

584
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Kills another one comes out of the sky hits the swamp

585
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Catalyzing all that chemistry in overdrive and somehow miraculously

586
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,488
For just a moment the reactions come together and just the right way to form

587
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Robert

588
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,096
Completely identical to you Robert

589
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,912
A brand new you if you took

590
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,984
Every single molecule in the swamp man's body

591
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
It would be

592
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,080
Exactly like you were at this very moment so here's the question

593
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Does swamp rabbit

594
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
Remember that date

595
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
Or does

596
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Swamp rabbit

597
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
Care about the ticket

598
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Your son is swamp gas Robert

599
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,160
Is molecule for molecule Adam4Adam

600
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
So you're saying are the memories and experiences of his life suddenly

601
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Contained in that facsimile

602
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
That's the question

603
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
And most people's intuition is

604
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
No

605
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
Absolutely absolutely not

606
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm not even hesitated why not

607
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
I believe

608
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
That my

609
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Date and the ticket

610
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
It took me to that date

611
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
They belong to me and not to Adam

612
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:24,064
And I don't know if you ask me what's the difference between me and my Adam's I don't know

613
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
But I know it's there

614
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Because the atoms

615
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
Have you sitting right there

616
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
Actually went on that day

617
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Where's the atoms of swamp gas Robert

618
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,608
Weren't there I think you got it exactly right that it's something about the history

619
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,728
Robert Adams really were in that place they really were there with that

620
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Person and

621
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,104
Although I could I could tell a version of the swamp gas Robert that weird

622
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Solve this problem

623
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
Is Robert this Robert

624
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,968
Set lighting you just got into the swamp

625
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,088
Submerged himself commingled his atoms with the swamp gas Adams

626
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
How many got out when tons weigh

627
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
If then later even like years later

628
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
The swamp

629
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
I brought her

630
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
About a copy

631
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
The fact that the real Robert was there to begin with

632
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
And that the copy somehow

633
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Hatched

634
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,544
I almost like a baton passing I could see that the date would be in the copy link

635
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
I think I might explain it to my

636
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Self

637
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
With fewest shenzhen

638
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Touch that is

639
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,528
My wife is very different you this to me

640
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,416
I one day while sitting around the office get a letter unbidden from the first man on the Moon

641
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
From the alarm

642
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
Just write something that I've written so that you do that it says

643
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
Commander Neil Armstrong

644
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Flattering

645
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
And if you could come

646
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
In any other form but my email

647
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
I would have

648
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
Framed it I would have given it a special place of honor

649
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
But since it arrived

650
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,224
From the machine to my machine and then out of the machine to another machine to a flat piece of paper

651
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
I can't give it that time can't give it to

652
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
The tickets

653
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
To the date

654
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
That's weird

655
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,696
Why because Neil Armstrong never touched

656
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
Yeah but you and I are old Robert so maybe that stuff

657
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
When was the moment you said I thought

658
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
I wish I was

659
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,544
Constructing an image in my mind of Neil Armstrong at a computer touching the keyboard

660
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
And

661
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
There is an

662
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Unbridgeable Gulf

663
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Between

664
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
His fingers

665
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
That paper you're older

666
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
I never actually touched

667
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,648
I mean if you think about is touch then you're right I got to see that he's now dead or not I think if

668
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
Just touching the paper he would

669
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
He would just be a little

670
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
I don't know

671
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Closer

672
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Well it's a funny tension I think because

673
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
You know what

674
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,848
Both science and at least some philosophical and even religious Traditions tell us is that

675
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
The world is impermanent nothing in it stays

676
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,992
The same RR we don't stay the same our bodies don't stay the same

677
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
The people that we love in the things we love don't stay the same that's just

678
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,184
The truth of the matter is if there's this constant impermanence in this constant flux and some

679
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Philosophers have argued over the years

680
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
We should just

681
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,560
Embrace that we would be Freer if we didn't

682
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
If we didn't

683
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
Try to hold that

684
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Flux for a moment

685
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
I have to say my feeling about it is

686
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Part of what makes

687
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
Everything so precious to us is exactly the fact that

688
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
We know it's going to do

689
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,176
Disappear we know it's impermanent we know it won't last

690
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
What we love is this thing now we love our for me the most dramatic example of this is our relationship

691
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Schizo

692
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
We know they're going to go we know that in 20 years from now if we they treat us with affectionate contempt will be doing really well

693
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
But that doesn't

694
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,888
Change the fact that right now

695
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,728
It's this child and not any other child in the universe

696
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:59,104
Just this one and I think that's there's something really deep and profound about our human lives that

697
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,712
The fact that we can do both of those things will be recognizing permanents but that we

698
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Filoli

699
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Attachments that

700
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
That seems to me to give our life at

701
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
It's very special texture

702
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Wow

703
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Exactly

704
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,440
I could just put that whole thing you just said in the

705
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,512
The frame like this Bow Down

706
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
People don't about you soon my friend because the next segment

707
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
It's going to

708
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
It's going to hurt

709
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,520
And it is at a more wind is blowing that's all I'll say

710
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
And I'm calling right before going to bed and Des Moines Iowa Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p

Life

714
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Seems very small

715
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
As it is day today

716
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
And then you just have these moments

717
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,600
Open it up and do something

718
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Much more complex and Rich

719
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Where is it

720
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,864
Hey I'm Jared Radiolab today

00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,456
Reagan I'm making toy I'm an artist and a mother and an educator

727
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
Know each other

728
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Oh yeah we're married

729
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
And finally

730
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
Dirk Dirk Von I was a street cop in the mostly Denver Craigslist unlikely best buddy

731
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,352
Give me the booty Bandit school together I would have just beat the crap out of him in the playground you know

732
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
Yeah we drive each other mad but in the end we can we can still scramble around just fine hard of what joined us is

733
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,568
Is where we were in love with with wilderness

734
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,968
For years they would take these trips together out into the Wilderness of Colorado or Utah no Maps

735
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,528
No GPS Snow Trails

736
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
No campfires

737
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Dirk and I would go off for weeks in the desert together I think the longest trip we took was a month

738
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
Just just wondering looking for routes

739
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Add was on one of these trips that they made a discovery

740
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
I think it's fair to say still haunts them today

741
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Recently

742
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
Almost killed one of our producers

743
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
So we've been out for a couple of days on this particular occasion the three of them are together and there a couple days into a hike

744
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
Yeah Utah

745
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Pink desert

746
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
But Rocky

747
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Slick Rock

748
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
Sandstone cliffs

749
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Canyonlands

750
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,416
Tell her I can do all these canyons and then we actually we split up

751
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
Reagan said she wanted to set her own camp and so she stayed in one canyon and Dirk and I popped over into the next Canyon

752
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Never really would you just

753
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,936
Send it to the normal thing or you guys fighting know it's normal

754
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
We weren't fighting at all it's one of the great things about being out together

755
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:12,384
That there's an he's with that soda separating is part of the deal and I think

756
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Reagan was looking at

757
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Derek and me and saying you guys are

758
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
Are going to go scrambling and get weird I'm going to stay over here I don't know if that was

759
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,768
What part of it was just that I was at least 5 months

760
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
Pregnant and I was just starting to have a really hard time tightening my backpack so that the weight wasn't all on my shoulders

761
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,240
And she says while she was hiking the pregnancy hormones work

762
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
Giving her bouts of vertigo it when it was just starting to hit early

763
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,616
Wow in a couple of months things going to be

764
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
So she needed some alone time

765
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
She said around camp

766
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Durkin Craig meanwhile

767
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,808
Scale-up is Cliff face to get to the next Canyon over

768
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
And when we get to the

769
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,672
Very close to the top and there's a little flat area

770
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Balcony of rock overlooking the

771
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
The canyon below

772
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,864
This little ledge so we said well okay let's just sit here have some lunch break out the pipe

773
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
That's exactly

774
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
So we sit down and and

775
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,920
And we literally both have like the first

776
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Lungful

777
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
When Craig decides to take his backpack off

778
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,856
And he leans over and I notice I'm bending over

779
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
A round object

780
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
Underneath the edge of a boulder

781
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
Back under the Shadow and you said

782
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Hey

783
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:41,984
There's a pot under the street

784
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
And then I I dropped to my knees and looked into this Shadow and there was this beautiful

785
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Red

786
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
Jar low and flat

787
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
Covered Maybe 700-800

788
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,112
Maybe a thousand years of dust

789
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
Kind of skull the sea jar with Justice

790
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Narrow mouth on the top and it had black paint

791
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,512
Design around the

792
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Around the mouth

793
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
We're talking about

794
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,424
Early Pueblo people cliff dwellers

795
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
People who lived out in that desert 1000 years ago

796
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
And he looked closer he could see that this particular job

797
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
It had a crack down the front of it

798
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,200
And that two holes drilled around the crack and then a piece of

799
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
Yucca twine have been used

800
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
Hide holes together she was precious to somebody so they might have left it there maybe it was during migration thinking they

801
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
They would return it sometime maybe they were on the Run maybe someone was hiding it from other people you don't know who

802
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
It was if it was Mahler

803
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
Gmail or what Clan or

804
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:47,008
And any of those stories but you know it was a human being in the same position that you're in right there

805
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:53,151
Doing the same thing the same gesture

806
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,599
You can see the hand reaching out and placing the object

807
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:09,791
You can imagine the hands and the feet and the people in the sounds that they would make

808
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
They stared at it for about an hour not really saying much

809
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
Vincent latest hits dirt

810
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,919
Wait a second we got to move this thing somebody else was going to find this just felt like if we can just

811
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
Just kind of luck into it what's to stop some four-wheel drive in bipedal Pillager doing the same cuz it's a

812
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:38,719
Nexus route I don't know I felt sort of protective of it cuz you know we're all over the Southwest looting dicks

813
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
Sites in that jar will be worth a lot of money tunes of thousands of dollars at least

814
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,519
Hands on this end so I thought well let's hide it grab his leg

815
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,895
The moment we touch that jar is no longer is part of that story it's now part of our store

816
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,967
He's a purist we we do not move this thing

817
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,343
Not moving protected that's covered like I wanted to build a Corral of stone around it

818
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,183
Camouflage that's exactly what I be looking for in fact

819
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
I wouldn't notice the

820
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
The Siege are I'd notice the Rock

821
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
Can I use somebody's hiding something

822
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Yeah right that's looking at me going

823
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
You and your Yoda crap

824
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
Damn and he says we could give this another

825
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
700 years of life

826
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,919
Helmeted been there probably a thousand years or so how do you resolve said you know will come back

827
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Tomorrow we'll just

828
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Leave it for now

829
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
How's the you left you left in a draw

830
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
We left in a draw and we actually

831
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,159
Hop back over the canyon to find Reagan

832
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
Badass samurai chick

833
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
I thought y all yeah I can

834
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
I'm be able to draft Reagan over to my side is it a hike back up in that ledge yelled out for her and the next day she

835
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
Icon over to where they were I remember

836
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
Her hitching up her pants

837
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
Pregnancy style and connect

838
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,639
Squatting down to get in there I was your first thought when you saw it

839
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
Focus

840
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,159
And just being right there completely consumed in that moment

841
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
And I think it went on for a long time cuz it was like so

842
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:22,911
The truth what we should do

843
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Oh you guys argue back and forth for at least an hour and a half and I just ignored you for most of it cuz I was just looking at the siege art I wasn't

844
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,687
I'm really thinking to be in the position of arbiter but I just got fed up and like that's enough you guys leave it alone

845
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
It's part of an ongoing story like

846
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Give it up leave it alone

847
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,159
And so so she take some pictures and we

848
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
And we walk away

849
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,607
And within a year of that moment

850
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Everything just like

851
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
When twirling

852
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Reagan and Craig had a baby

853
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Craigslist

854
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
Become a writer who writes a book becomes a bestseller

855
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:05,407
I quit the business and got divorced and everything changed

856
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
But even on that day

857
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
They knew

858
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
With this will be the center of things we talked about for the rest of our lives than the seed jar yeah the day we found the sea jar

859
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
Do you think it's still there

860
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
I think it's still there

861
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
I think it is

862
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:30,239
The routes pretty complicated with that particular location

863
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
I'd say 50/50

864
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Tops

865
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
Again if only

866
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
That were the end of the

867
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,511
We could have done the saying where you're just like Oh The Narrative power of objects meta blah blah

868
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,583
It is a damn thing there

869
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
Where did someone take it

870
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:02,751
We got so curious about this so we convinced Craig Reagan and Dirk to go back now they're here

871
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,103
Check we sent our producer Molly Webster along for the ride

872
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:14,271
Happy campers just arrived I didn't realize when they were like give me

873
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:20,671
Each other hug the first night of camp and I was there with my recorder but like

874
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,255
Actually like a big moment I guess this is a reason you're tripping

875
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
Reagan had said that one of the last times now that people have kids and family one of the last times we were together

876
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
What's besieger

877
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,663
Yay we still have a pretty clear and today we're really really really excited to like be together

878
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
How long ago was it when they found the thing

879
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,551
This was 11 years ago the kids were

880
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:53,183
Reagan was 5 months pregnant and the kids she was pregnant with his Jasper

881
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,791
Come say hi had his 11th birthday

882
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
Close the door and come say hi

883
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
Hi Humana Molly

884
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
Dirk

885
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,567
There could never met their kids but the last time you said Jasper Jasper was a baby

886
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,383
The other thing is

887
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
I'm just going to say

888
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,991
Craig and Dirk are like

889
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,319
Brothers from another mother

890
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,671
Like they are like the bestest bromance

891
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,743
They love each other

892
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
So much

893
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
Send me to eat so we

894
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,351
Get there we like drop our bags we go to sleep

895
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
And I

896
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:39,263
Woke up four-wheel drove for dries I don't have to know how to cook

897
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Out into the maysa park the cars and then we hiked a mile and a half to the edge of the Mesa

898
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
Basically the entire landscape felt like they had just put me in a bonanza set

899
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903
Gnarled wharfie trees

900
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,951
Red red Sandy

901
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Sandstone

902
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:04,095
They're you're on this Mesa and then it falls off into this Canyon and then there's like another Mesa

903
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:10,495
And then that falls off into a canyon there's another Mason than that and it's just this like unending landscape

904
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
We're floating up here now

905
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
Yeah

906
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,967
And their s*** is it just like

907
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:26,367
There's no sound card has no sounds no nothing

908
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,767
Internet

909
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:39,167
Off the top and across we went back to get Rig and basically our objective

910
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
Was to go somewhere into this like Canyonlands

911
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,639
And somehow find a a tiny little seed jar

912
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039
We're to go back because I like to think of it like this is going to change things if it's if it's not there

913
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:01,439
I'm going to be so mad I like to be out in the world and just think about it to go okay there's there's a

914
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Message are sitting there on her Boulder right now and I will be there for the longest time and it's just quiet

915
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:14,239
And I can imagine that the wind going around it and and some more sand

916
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,567
Building up and and it's just this really nice thought of

917
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,223
Isolation in perpetuity

918
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
I kind of want to hear it Echo

919
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,415
So we set up camp on the edge of a Mesa

920
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
And then

921
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
We all went to sleep

922
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,279
What's a futon

923
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:43,935
Eric Craig apparently has a flute in his bag boy

924
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:50,847
Cinnamon sweet so we we wake up like first lies today the day guys

925
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:57,247
Today's the day we go find out if if the egg is still there in the nest

926
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
A game to go down this 800 foot descent

927
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:07,487
No femurs are broken

928
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,071
The Anasazi were some tough

929
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
People

930
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,751
Big wind around this Canyon Drew saddle

931
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Another Canyon

932
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:28,991
How long is the psych take to get out there and probably took six maybe seven hours

933
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:35,391
We're going pretty slow the kids were amazing but also slow

934
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
It was starting to like this turn to bug Dirk I think it's the way to say it

935
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
Really hot

936
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,167
Sun straight overhead oven going

937
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
Park the kids

938
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,471
Somewhere

939
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Sure enough at the end of the 6 hour hike

940
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Leave your pack for the big guy

941
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
Extra water and

942
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
The kids need to break

943
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,759
And so assertive believe them in an Alcove on the side of the canyon

944
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,063
Mobile scramble

945
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,623
Play I brought my book

946
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Okay bye guys

947
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:15,839
In Reagan's boys you have your emergency whistles remember 3 times but no joking

948
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Final ascent

949
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:22,239
You know we went up that Anglewood up that diagonal there I remember it really

950
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:28,127
Really clearly I'm all behind you so there's this we were slammed up against his canyonwall we needed to get over it

951
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,943
And the only way to do that was that there was

952
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,271
Boulder sort of out in front of the canyon wall and it created this

953
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,879
Skinny Little Chute and we had a wedge ourselves into the Chute and like

954
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,487
Go off at 60 ft

955
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
I'd like to get off

956
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
I had to like

957
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,591
Put my back against one wall at my feet against the other

958
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Pretend to walk

959
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:03,967
And I have this moment we're before I left Dylan told me not to die for Radiolab

960
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
So I pause

961
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
And I was like

962
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,903
Okay don't do this for Radiolab

963
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,263
Never do that again

964
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,943
By the time we get done with the gnarly sent everyone's like

965
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,575
CJ's going to be there cuz no one else would do that that was really hard

966
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,439
Just just had just head down that been

967
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
So

968
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Durkin Cragar like

969
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
We did that route I'm absolutely

970
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,679
Siege are should be around here somewhere

971
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
Temple Boulder

972
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Looking under God like

973
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,175
Quarter of a mile of Canyon Phase 2 figure it out

974
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
Giant Temple

975
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Craig thinks

976
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
Tips to the laugh

977
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Dirk thinks it's to the right

978
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Anything Durk

979
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
No

980
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,535
Familiar decided

981
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
This is it

982
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
11 years

983
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
Yeah but I just I know this is

984
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
I know it

985
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
Don't seed

986
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Spot

987
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,247
Are like just going like really confused

988
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
Where's that far now

989
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,647
Duloxetine

990
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
I offer an hour

991
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:57,375
And it all like looks the same but everything looks the same to an untrained eye right

992
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,263
It's like where's Waldo land and we're trying to find

993
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,055
His thoughts

994
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
I finally see Craig kind of

995
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
Bar off down the canyon standing by himself

996
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
Just staring at the ground

997
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,039
Okay like okay

998
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Any luck

999
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
I went down

1000
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
Look at what would be

1001
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Has been are likely rata

1002
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
Yeah

1003
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:25,535
Which is right up through here and he points to the ground like right where we're standing

1004
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
And he says

1005
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
I think it's like right

1006
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Here

1007
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
I think like this

1008
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
Was the place

1009
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
I don't want to think about this

1010
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
Particular possibility

1011
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,871
See all that stuff I just walked across

1012
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Yeah

1013
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
That's all fresh

1014
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Oh series

1015
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Yeah

1016
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Play words that mean fresh

1017
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,879
What we were standing on this pile really sharp

1018
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
Rock it was just all of these Scharf

1019
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Little

1020
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Dragon knives

1021
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,583
I'm not sure didn't look like any of the other areas we had been in

1022
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
It's

1023
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Possible at the

1024
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Cliff has fallen here

1025
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
And covered everything

1026
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Top of that

1027
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,407
Cliff if you looked above us

1028
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,527
To the top of the cliff was like so many to take in a meat cleaver to it was just like sliced off

1029
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Whole thing

1030
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Brokaw

1031
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,415
The entire Cliff face had fallen off

1032
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,743
And annihilated

1033
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:33,375
Everything hundreds of feet in either direction it's been totally destroyed

1034
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,191
Yeah I mean they wouldn't survive

1035
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,543
Even the giant boulder protecting it has been wiped

1036
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Clean

1037
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,151
It reminded me of like an iceberg

1038
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
Uncapping

1039
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:52,575
You see all those videos of like the front of the iceberg just all the sudden Cleaves off that's exactly what happened on this clue

1040
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:57,439
That's all you're talking like 10,000 tons of rock falling here

1041
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Just

1042
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Yeah

1043
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
I mean

1044
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
That's not what I was thinking

1045
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Responsibility

1046
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
I'm not swallowing it

1047
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Just yet

1048
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:31,743
She calls and Reagan come toward us and then dirt comes wandering over

1049
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,303
It does kind of make sense I guess

1050
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
Pots been here for 700 years it does

1051
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,703
Make sense at all

1052
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,847
It's not looking right

1053
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
I can hear it was right

1054
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,199
I know it was here

1055
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
No

1056
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
No no no

1057
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
My God

1058
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
Craig's like leaning against the wall

1059
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,047
Dirk was like wow man I guess

1060
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,351
This must be it

1061
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,935
And it was this real like

1062
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,007
They were grappling with something and it was like

1063
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
Trying to figure out like what they were grappling with

1064
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,967
And cried just kept talking to me like not actually about The Siege our bit about the place this is where

1065
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
I remember

1066
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,295
Reagan hoisting up her pants

1067
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Pregnant

1068
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,367
Squatting

1069
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,439
And Derek and Me On Our Knees

1070
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Looking in on this thing for

1071
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
For the longest time

1072
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,327
You know it was very clear in my mind

1073
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,703
The have the place itself gone

1074
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
It's a damn fine

1075
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,311
It's beautiful it's wonderful but but Jesus

1076
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
This is a different kind of sadness and I wasn't quite though

1077
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
Are you sad

1078
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Yeah
