00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
I think there's stuff in here that we can all Steel

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664

Austin

71
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,048
Guinness is an excerpt of a conversation between Rachel Cusick and lots of knots

72
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Story finder

73
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
The game is

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
You want

75
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,032
Stories that people haven't heard before like you have to look in places where people aren't looking

76
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Incas people

77
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,384
Like the the low-hanging fruit is all take him you just adjust

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Assume that

79
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
And it's like okay I'm going to do some

80
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,856
Bizarre aerial acrobatic move and that's going to land me on this weird random tree branch

81
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,208
There's all this fruit over here that nobody's even touched you know

82
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,352
Lots of a listing for Rachel a few of his moves a few of the things he has engineered to get him onto those

83
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Out-of-the-way tree branch

84
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
These are some of my favorite fun things to do to find new story slam on me so okay so one of them

85
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,128
Is Google Alerts so you may or may not be familiar with Google Earth

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,504
Use that one for yourself cuz that's what most people do but the most fun way to use Google art I find

87
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Is that a

88
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
So what I do sometimes I just

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Come up with

90
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,136
Phrases that I think are

91
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
Fun or funny and I just set Google alerts on them

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Like what you have

93
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
So one of the ones that has been

94
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
Very interesting for me is I use the phrase

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
The human equivalent of

96
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
So I just set a Google alert for the phrase the human aquilo I know anytime anyone on the internet uses app

97
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Phrase the human equivalent of

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Like I find out about it

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Here's another one of you

100
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Bizarre but brilliant

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Or like thing people say I'll spend no it's not it's not but that's the thing that's why that is a few

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Times in India

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,976
Is get used like you're like oh exactly

104
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Or like another one I have

105
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
A self-fulfilling prophecy

106
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
I love that phrase

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
The light

108
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,959
When whenever anyone on the Internet is talking about self fulfilling prophecies I got to know about it

109
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
Not to say that it's important that I read any of that stuff inside most of the time I just

110
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
Delete it I just like we glanced at it and delete it

111
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
But every

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
I think of them as like little scratch off ticket

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Gets or something or like story lottery tickets like one day they're going to

114
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Yelp me something but who knows

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
So that's that's one Google alerts on weird phrases

116
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
What what else

117
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
Who's on the list is there more

118
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
Oh okay this is one way I think we should just do it right now although maybe I don't know if your you have to run out the door

119
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
I'm good what do you want to do

120
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
So it's just Wikipedia surfing like this is my go-to way of procrastinating

121
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Love

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
Wikipedia and in particular the thing I liked about Wikipedia more than anything else

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,855
Cuz if you go on to the homepage so go into the Wikipedia.org Do you have a

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
Okay so you go to wikipedia.org and then you go to English although if you want to go to another language

125
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
Okay so now if you look on the left hand side right

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Okay that was like the main page contents featured content that random article

127

Scary

184
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Illegally finding the difference

Between those two things

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479

196
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,967
What's particulars you want to find stuff that nobody else is fine then

197

There's a thing called worldcat which is amazing worldcat.org okay that is it's basically the library catalog

208
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Log of all libraries

209
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,223
You can search something so let's say you want to find just not even anything special

210
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Like just a normal butt

211
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
What you do is you put it in there

212
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
And you also put in your ZIP code

213
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
And then it'll be like oh hey

214
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
The

215
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
There's this

216
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
Library 2 mi away from you that has

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,631
A copy of that book or the nearest copy that book is in Nashville or whatever it is

218
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
My alarm but it's pretty cool but

219
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
World cat is great and is super helpful

220
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
What you're trying to find superb

221
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,151
Also it has a kind of sister site called archives grid which is like kind of

222
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
That that thing for special collect

223
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759

224
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Do you have oral history

225
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Jason mask

00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
The stuff that I get excited about what it like

227
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
They're just so many I think like

228
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
To me if I'm looking at these websites it's just all names

229
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
What

230
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
How do you pick a name to even listen to

231
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
Oh sometimes I like read descriptions of someone's will just be named okay let's just try it

232
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
Like and I'll just go to the next one I'm bored similar thing to that the IRL version of that

233
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Is talk to strangers

234
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
Like I talk to strangers all the time I talk to Uber drivers

235
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
All the time

236
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,111
She said the story so we did earlier this year we did the Border trilogy

237
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,975
That came from a conversation I had with a woman a stranger on a bus

238
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
So I was taking a bus from

239
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
New York

240
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,215
And I sat next to a woman very pleasant woman her name is Lynn

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
She's an anthropologist

242
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,383
And then I ask a question like like one of the questions I asked her was oh you know why

243
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Like who are the really cool

244
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,295
New Anthropologist working in the field where they help young people

245
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
And then she told me she's like you got to read this book The Land of Open Graves

246
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
And then I was like okay and then

247
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
Describe it to me a little bit and I was super interested then I went home that night

248
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
And I read the book cuz it was so good

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
It was so good and then that

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Like that started

251
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
You know that was the first Domino and then what ended up being not just

252
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,151
A full year for me but also for a whole bunch of other reporters and producers

253
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Like making that

254
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Into a full not just one episode

255
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Three apus

256
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
It's like where we

257
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,391
Yeah and and that all started just cuz I sat next to a lady on a bus like

258
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
Know that everybody around you has stories like they all have stories

259
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
The great amazing

260
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Stories that they they are

261
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
Fully willing to tell it's just like nobody's ass

262
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,263
You know and it's just like that's the thing like the whole world is like that like some other tricks that lot if shared

263
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Some of these have to be honest like

264
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
I'm not sure anyone

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Pam would have the

266
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Patients are emotional fortitude

267
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
To do

268
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
But he says he reads a bunch of

269
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Really

270
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Secure

271
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Trade magazines

272
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
The roller coaster Association of America

273
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Like the ice cream manufacturer

274
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Something something trade magazines that you will never ever care about him millionaires like if you were in solitary confinement and

275
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
You got a stack of Detroit magazine

276
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,471
You would still not read them like that kind of boring and then to find a

277
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Dorian there

278
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Define something that is not just

279
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
Interesting but also is like moving and also makes you

280
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
You think and also makes you like

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
Like if that's a that's a superpower

282
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,575
Superpower I like out of all the superpowers

283
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
To make boring things interesting

284
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
To make people

285
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Like

286
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Like awaken to the world around them and see that it's actually way more exciting than they give it credit for like that

287
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
I don't know that's like

288
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
That's literally the reason I get up in the war

289
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Now one thing a lot of stress

290
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,639
I know this is really important is that even though he is constantly finding tons of ideas

291
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
He is here

292
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
Like the percentage of of the ideas he pitches

293
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
Versus the number we accepting end up going with

294
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,903
That number is still pretty low the one I should one funny story about

295
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Story of pets like I remember when the first

296
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Sorry that gets every alive I was like

297
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Look like they're all there

298
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Like

299
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
In the world of math

300
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,751
There are all these like people who do all this Advanced geometry and then the way they do it

301
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,591
Is knitting they like knit all these like complex shapes

302
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Anime

303
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Like the netease like

304
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
Absurd things and they learn

305
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,391
It'll be so cool like knitting a knitting all the time

306
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
I know I was like she still interested in it

307
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
I remember pitching in the room and it being like

308
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,351
The biggest dud and one of the reasons why

309
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
I think it was

310
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Jazz

311
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
We'd like

312
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
You realize that

313
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Like you can't hear

314
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
Skier knitting right like knitting is like the worst radio story idea like it's the most boring thing

315
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
You could possibly hear on the radio like

316
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
That's not going to work

317
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,319
Mother said that in part it was all that rejection

318
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm sorry for the

319
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
It look what it led to

320
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
All that rejection led him to develop

321
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
All of these

322
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Otter and Otter

323
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Techniques for finding tails

324
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Which formerly he kept to himself at first when I was doing this I was like so super secretive about it I was like you

325
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
He was all my secret sauce

326
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,847
She knows like no way like why would I tell you that

327
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
It's like a recipe that you don't want anyone to have like the best

328
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
Cookie in the house

329
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
But then at some point you're like

330
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Yeah the world would just be a

331
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,927
Better place if there were more cookies and it's like like like theirs.

332
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
Yeah I know you do yes before Radiolab

333
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Yep

334
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Here's what I tell my

335
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
I tell myself that there are

336
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
7 and a half billion people on planet

337
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Arthur 7 and 1/2 billion

338
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
And if you presume

339
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
That's a

340
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
That 1% or even Point 1/4

341
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Have life

342
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Fascinating stories

343
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm like a dynamic newsworthy

344
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Exciting dramatic

345
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Movie where these stories happening

346
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
On any given day or any given week

347
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Week rights

348
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
If you presume that 1% of those having a half billion people have those stories like

349
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
There is no way all the stories are getting told there's just no way but there's just not enough journalist in the world to tell all the

350
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,287
Those stories and those are just the alive people

351
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,639
There are a lot of dead people who have great stories there are a lot of

352
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,711
Animals who have great stories and businesses and

353
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Consumer goods and

354
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Planets

355
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
And inanimate objects and microbes and like there's like

356
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Finity of stories

357
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
All around us

358
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
More dramatic than any movie

359
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
For True Story Finders

360
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
The world is a scavenger

361
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
