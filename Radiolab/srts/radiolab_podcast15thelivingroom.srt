End NPR

00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
Religious Radiolab and our show today is about being witness to something especially not something you really

4
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
Choose to witness and you feel like it should I be saying this is a story that for me speaks to like what it's like to live

5
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
The city when you look out the window we're somewhere Elso Jam together that suddenly you're seeing into the live to somebody else

6
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Through their window and the

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
You just kind of fall into it without even want to in this particular tale it what is observed is so sad

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
Surprising and so forth tenderness and forth quiet love that we it's a rare thing to see so we wanted to send it

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
Your way from our friends over radiotopia Nick Van Der kolk and Brendan Baker to here we go this is how their Story begins

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
Started Living in

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
In my apartment about 15 years and one evening

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
I walked in the living room which has three bay windows which Facebook Gardens in the back

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
And over half a block of Gardens and across a small Street there was this bright window

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
That I've never noticed before it but it's at the exact eye level of my third floor

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Apartment and after a while I realized that I never seen it because there had always been curtains

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
And so I think dimly-lit the curtains were often closed and all of a sudden there's this bright light and milk

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Curtains and it was like a movie screen

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
15 years and that window is meant nothing I haven't even know

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Noticed it and now it's all I think about

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
There were new tenants and it had always been a live

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Living room and now it was suddenly a bedroom and there are these two people in there and they

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
We're naked this young couple in their twenties they were really lovey-dovey and they were

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Always naked csdn wiper who tells the story and she told it to

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Radio voter Brianna Breen who produces peace with Megan Brennan the thing is they pushed their

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Bed so that the head was up against the windows so their heads you could see the both of their heads

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Lying there so you'd see things that you just like there were just shocking I just had been there all of this time and

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
And suddenly you could see people having sex really clearly like this like amazing we clearly I-84

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
I had no idea that you could see so well across such a distance and it was

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Was really uncomfortable my husband and I were still adjusting to Parenthood

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
And it wasn't the most romantic time in our in our lives and my son was probably 3

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
And when your new parents to a toddler especially because he sleeps in bed with us

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
That's too so he's like literally right between us the last thing you need is a couple of hotties getting it on

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Across the window reminding your husband of everything

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
I have this really beautiful young woman that was really thin and and and naked

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Really you know it was very frustrating and end in if she had this beautiful

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
Tall lanky well-built boyfriends

37
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
Anti first I die just because I felt like my husband was going to be staring at the naked woman all the

38
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
What time I started closing the living room curtains which is really kind of silly and it made our room really dark and we know

39
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
Never close those curtains and so that didn't work

40
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
So I thought about like making a really big sign that says like close your curtains

41
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
Buy curtains they didn't even have curtains by curtains we can see you and I thought about going by their building

42
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
I have no idea what their unit was and leaving a note and then I started

43
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
That was really silly and prudish and started realizing that they were just young

44
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
And I had to just get over it and live with it and move on and so

45
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
So that's what I did

46
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
We got really used to them and then they became sort of the symbol of what we used to be

47
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
In our twenties and they were living the really care free time and that's another thing that was kind of hard

48
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
Hard not to sometimes when you're in early Parenthood you get a little bitter I think that some of those freedom

49
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
Then we'd watch them sleeping till 11 while we've been up since 5 with our toddler in and we saw them

50
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Eating breakfast on the roof together so we got used to it only we know we would notice like a new

51
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
Can I plant in there and they became sort of part of our Lives you know because they were just always there and never

52
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Ever bought curtains do you think all the Neighbors in your building and the surrounding building

53
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Also saw this it's funny I think that the way that we are positions

54
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
Because all of the buildings around us are different sizes and our building is the tallest one on

55
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:50,207
Tarblock but it's exactly at the right level to see their their windows

56
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
I have a friend next door and then a friend across the way and and all of them have Windows facing the gardens but not

57
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
All of them are blocked and I look at the other windows of the buildings around us and I don't think anyone has

58
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
This perfect level view the irony is that I'm such a private person

59
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
And I don't know if my supposed to have maybe respected their privacy and just looked away but it's

60
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
It's impossible because that's the way the chairs face to face the window I couldn't I couldn't not see

61
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
If I wanted to but I guess I could have not gotten the binoculars

62
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
Set a timer

63
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
By and this is maybe a year-and-a-half later two years later and I remember seeing the room

64
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
And the light was on but it was empty and I thought that was strange because it was 5 in the morning and

65
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
They never went anywhere early and it was like that for like a whole week was just as empty room with a lighter

66
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
And I thought that was strange they they didn't seem to be there as often

67
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
Or maybe just she would be there and he was gone for long periods of time and we just kind of forgot about them you know

68
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
There were they weather wasn't as much action going on and they were in his presents and so we just kind of

69
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,647
Lived our lives and forgot about them for maybe 7 or 8 months

70
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
The end of last year in December

71
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
There was this night when my husband and I separately had both seen this woman naked sitting

72
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
The window kind of chubby slump shouldered woman who was just looking down at

73
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
The street and we both thought it was so strange just couldn't figure out who she

74
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
He was and what she was doing and why she was naked and a few nights later there was

75
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
Was this young man standing right at the window by the bed and he was

76
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
Skeletal he was so thin and he was bald completely

77
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
And we realized it was the same couple they had completely changed

78
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
You sick there's something serious

79
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
Wrong with him

80
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
After that I just watched the window all the time

81
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
We're going to pause it right here

82
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
Here let's just be right back

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab and I'm here because I need your help

87
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
This summer and I have request for those of you who spend a lot of time

88
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Parents and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

89
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something that just means

90
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
How did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kids you've been reading

91
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
Started reading back to you or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were due

92
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
Advanced math class

93
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
Origin of the geometry homework kid does something

94
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
Super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us and go to Radio

97
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
I am Jedi Broad River coach this is Radiolab let's get back to our story from Brianna Breen and the folks eleven radio

98
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
Nick Van Der kolk and Brendan Baker so we're just going to go back to the room C

99
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
See what's what we can see through the window you're staying wiper I just watched the window

100
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
All the time and

101
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
He would sit all day he was there because I work from home and I would see him

102
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
I'm all day in the bedroom either lying down or sitting at the computer and then after

103
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
A couple of weeks he was just lying down and he was just there and his bald head would be

104
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
Up against the the pane of glass all the time and she would be there

105
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
There and she come in and she would bring him things but mostly it was just him there by himself and

106
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
Sometimes he would have liked his knees bent and you could just see how skeletal they were they were just bone

107
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,495
And sometimes you kick off the blankets and he was just lying there naked in it

108
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Emaciated

109
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
And then after awhile he should always burrowed under the blankets like I found myself

110
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Thinking like what maybe she's been through chemo and he's recovering and you guys going through this

111
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
The six phase before he gets well because you so young he didn't you know he's just such a young guy

112
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
And

113
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
So we had to go to Colorado to see my family for Christmas and worry

114
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Read all the time I was there I would have thought about them and I worried that he wasn't going to be there when we got back

115
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
Back I worried all the time about it when we got back about 10 days later

116
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
He was still there but his head looked so much smaller and

117
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
And there were a lot of people there and and then I got out

118
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
My binoculars

119
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
I got my birding binoculars I'm not proud of it but at that point

120
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
I felt so invested

121
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
They look like people coming to say goodbye

122
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
And there was this sort of short blond Midwestern look

123
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
Looking woman who I guess was his mother and then there was this young guy who just kept pace

124
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Chasing the Halls you know you could just see their two doorways leading out of this room and you could just see him go down one side and 3

125
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
Other than back and forth and back and forth and I figured he was the brother and

126
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
It look like the girlfriend's sister was also there was just I was just a guess looked like her

127
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
I remember there was just this little gathering going on in the living room

128
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Right below the neighbors were standing around and having drinks and they have no idea at all

129
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
What was going on right upstairs I would watch people come and go then after a while

130
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Everyone left except for the girlfriend and the mother and and I spent

131
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
And I spent all that evening like sitting vigil in

132
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
On the back of the couch and and watch it and and

133
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
I remember the girlfriend lying beside him for a long time on our own and she was just stroking its face

134
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
So tenderly it was so much affection that really transcend

135
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
The kind of young love that you expect all I could see was the top of his head all that time

136
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
And I remember later seeing her standing by the

137
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
The bed when the mother on the other side and they were just all talking and she put a hand on his forehead to the back

138
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
Back of her hand on his forehead and then she was wiping at her eyes and you could tell that there was

139
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,703
This that there was the sense that something that it was getting closer

140
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Then I could see this Reckoning or she she was wiping her

141
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
Her eyes and touching his forehead and wiping at her eyes and

142
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
There were candles lit and in this

143
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
Young woman was on one side and his mother was on the other side

144
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
And they just were lying there for a really long time and I had

145
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Their hands just resting on his chest and so I watched it

146
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Prolong time

147
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
The mother in the girlfriend relying on either side of him and you could tell it was his this was the end

148
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
I thought now all that's left is the girlfriend in the mother and inexplicably

149
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,263
Me me

150
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
Three people at the Deathbed

151
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
And I lay there for a long time and then they just got up and they hate went into the other room

152
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
And I realized that must have been the moment

153
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
Aunt

154
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
All this time you know what I always have the sense that you know that they're going to break up

155
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
They're going to move out nobody that age stays together very long and

156
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
I had no idea it was just like this beautiful love story

157
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
So the next day the next day I got up and went

158
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,487
The window first thing and they were folding up blankets and stay

159
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
Stacking them on the bed and I figured that he had been taken away and so

160
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
I was in the kitchen and my husband called because he had maybe knew how obsessed I'd gotten with the sea

161
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Situation and he said there's activity over there and I came running and I got my binoculars and I

162
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
I looked him and realize that he was still there he was still in the bed his body was still there

163
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
And it was the coroner so the coroner and his assistant came and they had these white plastic glue

164
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Gloves on and they pulled his body to the edge

165
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
Shut the bed and onto this white sheet and I just remember the lifelessness of it it look

166
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
So shrunken it almost looks like a shrunken rubber proxy

167
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Everybody

168
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
So incredibly dead they wrapped him in a sheet and they zipped mm

169
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:37,023
Into a vinyl bag and they put him on this kind of Gurney they took the gurney out

170
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
I just had this very strange impulse and I ran and threw on my coat

171
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,031
Kind of over my pajamas and ran out to the street ran to the corner

172
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
And I got there just as they were calling him out they were carrying him out

173
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
And the girlfriend was there she was talking to one of them in the doorway

174
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
And they loaded him into this van and I realized that

175
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
They know me at all like I had you know I have no place to be there and

176
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:20,031
They looked at me I remember the coroner's assistant looking at me like I was sort of a like a rubbernecker

177
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:26,431
Girl in the street you know looking at this grisly scene and I realized that's that's what I was

178
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
I had no place to be there and suddenly it all felt so perverse and so I went home

179
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Home and I felt very strange about the whole thing

180
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
And I tried to tell myself that I never wanted to be part of their lives I want it I was the one that wanted them to

181
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
How to put up curtains I wanted them to just shut the intimate stuff out I was uncomfortable with it I was the one

182
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
It wanted out

183
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
Can I started remembering all of a sudden when I moved to that apartment so many years ago

184
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
And I was in my mid-twenties that had to share the apartment with a roommate cuz it was too

185
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
Expensive my bedroom was in the living room and I remember how when I first moved in

186
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
And I pushed the head of my bed up against the three bay windows so so that in the morning I could see

187
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,471
See the sky and

188
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
I remember that I had no clue it never occurred to me that anyone could see me that

189
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
I remember that I felt like whenever I looked out the window I never saw anyone and

190
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
I never close my curtains either

191
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
Did you ever find out either of their names I I never

192
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
Have found out their names and I looked through the local obituaries obsessively

193
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
4 weeks and there was never anyone that fit his description there was never anyone young enough for

194
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
That looks like him so no idea I walked by their place ever

195
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
What times and there's only their only numbers on the mailboxes in the buzzards and there's

196
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,743
There are no names so I can't look up anything I don't know I've no idea who she is

197
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
I have no idea who he was

198
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
No idea what he was sick with

199
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
I don't know

200
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
If I've gotten anything right maybe they were married but I didn't get the fact that he died

201
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Because

202
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,455
I was there I was there for that

203
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Because I saw it all

204
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,391
I think about that a lot how he chose

205
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
But he chose to die in that in that bed in that bedroom

206
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
And he didn't choose to Goodwill hospice or

207
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Anywhere he wanted to be in his bedroom

208
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
All of those long days from the morning when I looked out in the evening he was just exactly the same position

209
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
That was where he wanted to be

210
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
And I

211
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,087
It's where all of the happy times where I guess in the end times you know

212
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
Just a couple days after it happened she was up on the roof with a friend doing

213
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Doing yoga and I watched her lying around a lot she

214
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
When out-of-town I think for a bit and she still there

215
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
I have been watching her recovery and instead of being this

216
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Young woman

217
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
She looks totally different she looks so changed she just

218
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
Looks like this very experienced world-weary person

219
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
She has a job now that gets hurt very early cuz I get up at 6 and she's already dressed

220
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
Kids out at like 6:15 and the other night I saw her

221
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
And she was in her bedroom and she was wearing this bag

222
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
A T-shirt and all the lights were on and and she was dancing

223
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
Just dancing around her room so yeah

224
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
On her I want her to move on this this young woman that I was so

225
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,872
Cranky and bitter about you know now she's now she's that way.

226
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,456
Protective and kind of maternal you know

227
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
If you ran into her at the corner market or something do you think you could ever say anything to

228
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
Yeah if I ran into her I wouldn't say it

229
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
What would I say I've been watching you through your window how creepy would that be

230
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah no way

231
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
She doesn't know she doesn't know that

232
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
She doesn't know that there's this person that

233
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
I don't know if it's a complete stranger

234
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
But that they're really rooting for her and I

235
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
Diane Webber told her story to radio reporter Brianna Breen
