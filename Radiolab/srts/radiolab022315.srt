Goodwill

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
We have all gathered here today to

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
To talk about the wonderful world of

12
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
Professional wrestling my favorite world

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,480
So yes we're going to talk about freshman wrestling for the first half

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
The show we realize it's a lot of you out there listening right now for like

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
Seriously eyes there people like

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:03,488
35 years old you love wrestling I get this lot if I'm tweeting about a lot I get two weeks ago

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,536
You know it's fake right

18
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,120
It's like well do I write you that when you tweet about your favorite movie

19
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
It's Entertainment

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
The awesome thing about wrestling is

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,288
Is that there are these random things that are a little bit real

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
And sometimes those moments realistic and

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
They can change everything now if you're like me and you grew up in the 80s

24
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
Might remember wrestling is like you know Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Epic

26
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Matchups are kind of great but also sort of ridiculous

27
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Cartoonish

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
According to Peter Rosenberg

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
There was a moment where wrestling started to sort of Tinker

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
With reality in a much more nuanced

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
And

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
Fascinating what you could argue

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
That pro wrestling became a real estate Association of the Baroque movement of the 16th

34
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
CenturyLink postmodern

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
I know people that would

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
You're going to meet him

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
I'm Jared I'm Robert

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Is his Radiolab Ed

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
According to Peter this

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Whole thing's

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
This whole thing

42
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
Goes back to this moment called the Montreal screwjob the Montreal screwjob was

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,984
Above anything else that ever happened there that will ever probably ever happen again because it was

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
Order reality transpiring right there in the

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
I mean it was real life just came in for whole

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
In the fiction

47
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
That guy just heard is David Shoemaker I write about professional wrestling for Grantland and the guy you're about to hear is journalist

48
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Simon Adler

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
He will take the story for

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay so the moment in question really centers around this one guy name

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,264
Brett Bret The Hitman

52
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,176
Bret Hart is seen by many to be the greatest in-ring performer of all time

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
She was one of the good guys the best there is the best there was

54
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
In the business they call him a Babyface

55
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Is that what you call the good guys

56
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
A good guy in wrestling as a baby

57
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,608
He was my favorite wrestlers a kid I didn't understand why at the time but now I do

58
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
It's because he did everything so well

59
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
And in that era

60
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
The mid-to-late eighties when I fell in love with him

61
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,616
So many guys would miss big and Hawking in a little bit clumsy

62
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,944
But Brett did the kind of work that you could show to someone who's

63
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Who's never watch wrestling

64
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
I think they could see the art

65
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
And I think they could see how it's

66
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
It's like ballet

67
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
Or a million other art forms

68
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you mean Zin

69
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
You can kind of see this when you watch old Bret Hart matches on YouTube

70
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Gliding through the air

71
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
Bouncing off the mat off the ropes keep tell stories brilliantly

72
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Within the way he

73
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,968
Executes a match the wrestling is scripted but there's a lot of improv going on there the set beads

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
She knew how to take those moments in

75
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
In that Improv

76
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Make you

77
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Think so shoot he's about to lose and then

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,047
He was a natural-born wrestler

79
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,167
You know that his father was up with the legendary wrestler of his brother Owen

80
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
Legendary wrestler

81
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
He comes from

82
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
This Canadian wrestling royalty me is a

83
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
The kid growing up by

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
Have the ability to watch the weather

85
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Fortune watch these

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
Very dressing Styles and techniques

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
That Bret Hart in an interview in 2000 on fresh air and he says it's some of his earliest memories as a kid

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
These massive

89
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,863
Dude showing up to his house and hanging out in his basement with his dad

90
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
Who is teaching them how to be wrestlers

91
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
He would pull on these old Bowie tights

92
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
And that he would

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Wrestle with these guys

94
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
He would literally

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
Women wrestling holds these submission wrestling hold

96
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Obsession and

97
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Torture these big huge football player

98
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Hours and they wouldn't scream

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Literally this hype

100
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
It screams of terrifying I'll be upstairs in the room above it and as I got older I would go down and actually Venture into the room and sit on the bench

101
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
And watch

102
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
He would sometimes these wrestlers would run out

103
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
When my dad finally let them go that actually run out

104
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Tear out of the

105
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Out the doorway in out the

106
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
Outside sometimes in the snow and run out with Ann in their bare feet and you and even see them again I mean there's a legendary so many legendary stories about

107
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
The Hart family but you

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
You know my favorite among many is

109
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
The bear that lived in their backyard during Summers

110
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
Because at the time

111
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,951
Wrestling a bear was a thing that would actually happen from time to time no really

112
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
And

113
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
Brett tells a story in his

114
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Is book

115
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
About you're just sitting there and letting the Bear lick his toes

116
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
Something like this is this is a life that they that he lived and he was

117
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
He was so in so ingrained in him

118
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,151
In the early 80s Brett was working for his dad's company

119
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
And well that's going on in Canada there's this guy Vince McMahon

120
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
Back in the US who is building kind of Des wrestling Empire

121
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
It basically he's buying up all of these small promoters

122
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Acrostic

123
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Country and eventually goes up into Canada

124
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,095
Advise out Brett's dad's company I bought it 1984

125
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
They paid him a certain amount of money to stop running

126
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Can I go out of business

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
And then they took on

128
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Is better wrestlers

129
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
At the time which

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Christmas elf

131
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Couple brother-in-law's

132
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
Shortly thereafter

133
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
The WWF

134
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Tums

135
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Under Fire

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
Hulk Hogan Another World Wrestling Federation stars of taking the offensive against accusations that many have been still

137
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,023
Monster mentality led to widespread

138
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,095
Steroid abuse in the World Wrestling Federation so there's a

139
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Steroid crisis Vince

140
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,495
Have to deal with all of this litigation and he kind of needs to Rebrand

141
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
His organization he needs a new good guy

142
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
A new Champion a new baby face

143
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
And

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Books to read for that

145
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
For a couple of weeks

146
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
According to David Shoemake one

147
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Is that he's a traditionalist

148
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Sort of a throwback to an earlier time

149
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
2

150
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
You got that big so when you see him you don't think

151
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Sterilite. Definitely have road rage

152
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
And so he saw that and Bret Hart

153
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
During the 90s

154
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
Vince makes Brett a really big star

155
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
The new face of the company I mean he was on The Simpsons

156
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,455
He was a really really big stock you know they're people who criticize Brett for saying he wasn't that fun or took himself too seriously

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
But he was a serious worker he took wrestling very seriously myself really fighting hard to

158
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
Actually surviving come out of it can actually come out of the wrestling profession someday soon

159
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
A wrestling tragedy

160
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Which is what so many of them turn out

161
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Okay so fast forward to night

162
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
95-99

163
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,175
6 at the time a major rivalry was starting between the WWF Vince McMahon

164
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
And the WC.

165
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Which was Ted Turner's

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
What company head-turner multi-millionaire and one of his big tactics is I'm just going to start buying all of

167
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
All the wrestlers

168
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
From the WWF

169
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
From Vince McMahon's organization so he's offering them

170
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
More money use offer

171
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Bring them longer contracts music

172
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,447
It's like flooding it with money to steal all the stars from WWF and then in late 1996

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Brett got an offer

174
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Turn it really went in for the kill

175
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
From WCW that was huge

176
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
2.8 million dollars

177
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,479
We have to show some common sense me on first or UPS in this right for your family

178
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
But I mean how much money do you need sometime

179
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,903
I found myself torn between trying to do the right thing for my family and at the same time

180
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Show my loyalty

181
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,023
That the clip of Brett talking in a documentary that was being filmed at the time

182
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,399
Call wrestling with shadows which is fantastic filmmaker Paul J was nice enough to let us play some

183
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Connecticut

184
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Brett gets this offer

185
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
He's got kind of this

186
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Terrible decisions

187
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Because

188
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
Vince gave him a lot you know you really gave him his life and initially Beretta side there's no way

189
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
I'm going to leave

190
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Not like my relationship with

191
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
With Vince McMahon was always sort of like a father

192
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
And I sort of Saw myself if I left

193
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
It would have been a little bit like leaving my dad

194
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Especially when the chips are down

195
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
He really did see

196
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Vince as a father

197
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Sabrett goes to Vincent

198
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
Basically says convince me to stay it went back and forth conversation about him signing a long-term deal at 1

199
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Your deal with WWF

200
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Not for as much money but for guarantee

201
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Security

202
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Vince

203
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Said

204
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
I can't afford to pay you that

205
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Stock events

206
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,599
In the documentary Brett and his wife there sitting at the kitchen table

207
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Received

208
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Because nobody wants Bret Hart more than

209
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,559
NYC letting you go

210
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Compete with turn

211
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Turner's hell-bent on trying to put them out of business

212
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
I got to think about everything

213
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
I got to think about everything

214
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Color

215
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Shut this off now for a little while

216
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Ultimately

217
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
It became clear that Brett would have to go

218
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Take the money

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
I can't help it feel really

220
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
And disappointed that dumb

221
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Did I left this company

222
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
So this really gets to the heart of

223
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Once

224
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Brett decides he's going to

225
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
They have to figure out how

226
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
How

227
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Are they going to make

228
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,015
This is really the pivotal question

229
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Behind all of this

230
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
Get yo it's a very very delicate situation

231
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,279
That's Vince Russo and this was sort of his problem to solve because he work for Vincent

232
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
And you could say I was his right-hand man because I was writing the show

233
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
She was part of the team that scripted who would win who would lose

234
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,031
How would happen you know I mean I was literally putting the show on paper

235
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Oh yeah once a week

236
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,919
Weight-wise it's a hard question I mean can you just pick up and leave because he's the champion

237
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
He has the belt

238
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,783
The physical belt the giant golden black belt buckle thing

239
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
And that belt is the symbol of the company

240
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,975
And everybody in it that everybody working behind the scenes everybody was trying to support their family

241
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
That belt was a representation of

242
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,935
All that the worst thing that can happen is your Champion walking away with the belt to the new company

243
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Holding up the championship from The Old Company

244
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Where they can just defile it

245
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
If they wanted to

246
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
That was not an option for Vince McMahon

247
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
This is an imperfect comparison but the closest thing I come up to in my mind

248
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
Is it would be like LeBron James

249
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Quitting

250
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
His contract with Nike

251
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
And then showing up

252
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
In Adidas commercial

253
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
And taking a piss

254
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Into a pair of Nike

255
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,839
So you know Vince at the end of the day he just had to get that belt off of bread

256
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,143
So their initial thought their first plan

257
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
Was probably the simplest.

258
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,543
There was a match coming up this big event a Pay-Per-View event

259
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
In Montreal

260
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Bread being the champion of the company

261
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
He just lose to the number two guy

262
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Shawn Michaels

263
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Vince

264
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Love Sean

265
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
I mean really thought Sean was a Megastar what you was right about

266
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
Clearly Sean was next in line

267
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
So they pitched this idea of breath

268
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
And Brett was like I can do that

269
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
For 1

270
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Keeping Sean's an idiot

271
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Shut this Primadonna personality

272
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
He's better than everyone else

273
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
There's something very arrogant and obnoxious the bottom

274
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
Because he was he was a showman he would hump

275
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
The ring

276
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
Just like do ridiculous things in like to Bret Shawn with the Triumph of

277
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Style over substance

278
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Also

279
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
You're asking bread

280
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
The wrap up his career in the WWE

281
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
With a loss in Montreal

282
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
In Canada

283
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Where he is a national hero

284
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Describe the events I just assumed

285
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Blow my brains out

286
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
The same

287
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
What you're asking

288
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
To do from

289
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Character standpoint that's what I would

290
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Bret the Hitman Hart with bullets

291
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Makeup

292
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
The whole thing's

293
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Day of the match

294
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,783
Still nothing has been decided as to how the match is going to end

295
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Brett is backstage in

296
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Eventually he goes to Vince

297
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Have a conversation

298
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
The documentary crew filming all of this

299
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,583
And at this point then says no I don't want any cameras in here get those out of here

300
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Red actually end up wearing a wire

301
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
To document the conversation that's about to happen

302
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
I never ever want to leave here with any kind of bad feeling good this week has been a bad week for me I feel kind of betrayed a little bit

303
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
Well I do to a little bit and again while we're talking about really is Ted Turner between you and me

304
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
Appreciative I will always pay for everything you've done I didn't want to leave

305
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
It all has no other choice but to go the way this whole thing is been depicted it's really hard for me that you're

306
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
Come up short this weekend

307
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
What would you want to do today then I'm up and I think what I'd like to do is get through today I think tomorrow I should just

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
When do mice

309
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Sabrett suggest that the send

310
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Lynda

311
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
Usually what that means something called Ashmont

312
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,135
Typically in a small the ring is just flooded with a bunch of wrestlers and Chaos ensues

313
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,975
The referee usually is thrown out of the ring and ends in some sort of draw

314
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,815
Brett would that appear on Monday Night Raw the next day

315
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Introverted

316
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
That is what he planned on doing

317
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
So that way you could turn over the belt but not lose exactly

318
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Eventually events

319
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Okay fine

320
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Coming up

321
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
It all goes wrong

322
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Radiolab will continue in a moment

323
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
This is Jim Donahue from Fort Worth Texas

324
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,071
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science

325
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Technology in the modern world

326
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
More information about Sloan

327
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Www.

328
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Sloan. Org

329
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,615
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

330
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
And I'm here because I need your help

331
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
And I request

332
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,135
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

333
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

334
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Brilliance

335
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Basically I want to hear about this

336
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
Times when a kid you know did something

337
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
It just means you lean back and say

338
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Wow

339
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
How did they do that

340
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Maybe it was the moment that I

341
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,055
Kids started reading back

342
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
To you

343
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

344
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,479
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

345
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,343
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

346
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,487
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

347
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
But it doesn't have anything to do with the test

348
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
If you have a story

349
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
T-shirt

350
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143

356
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303

Olympic match

363
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
What we've all been waiting

364
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Okay. So Survivor Series 1997 Montreal

365
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Who is the drama

366
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
So around 9:20 p.m. 20,000 people in the stand countless television screens across the country

367
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Shawn Michaels

368
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
And he comes out singing

369
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Sing his own theme song

370
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
I think I'm cute I know I'm sexy

371
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
Singing karaoke style if re-recorded

372
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
That's an approach

373
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
He's got his hair in a ponytail he's wearing his trademark black

374
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,415
Spandex pants with hearts all over them like

375
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
He is the manifestation of everything

376
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Set breakfast

377
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,119
And then outcomes Bret Hart

378
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Waving

379
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
The Canadian flag

380
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,751
Can you walk

381
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Into the ring

382
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
Get the intake off a championship belt has it to the rap

383
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
And before the match

384
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Even officially begin

385
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
Sean flies at bread and just started wailing

386
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
Sean and Brett they're going at each other with a sort of like real for real

387
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Pretty quick there outside the

388
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Ring picks up

389
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Sean checks him over the sea

390
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Security railings

391
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
Then there's this

392
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
Read Pick Sean up to that Sean's legs are straight up in the air and then Brett

393
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,279
Just slam them on his back

394
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
In all of this is scripted

395
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Everything I know about it is like

396
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,727
They're following the The Narrative art but like they know okay we're going to fight

397
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
Outside the ring for a while and then

398
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
XYZ will happen

399
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
And So eventually

400
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
Retro Sean back into the ring and then you get

401
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Make appointment the mattress feels very early in the match

402
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Where Brett

403
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
Climbs onto the turnbuckle

404
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Which is the corner post of the Ring

405
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,743
Get up on top of that catapults himself off the turnbuckle

406
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
Through the air

407
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Chords

408
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Shawn Michaels

409
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,143
Super dramatic is kind of floating in the air there for a moment

410
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
And then what Sean does ripe

411
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,663
Before bread is about to come and hit him he pulls the referee

412
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
In between bread

413
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
And Sean

414
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
A human shield

415
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,599
Hit the referee the referee hit Sean and all three men

416
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Are lying

417
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
On the map

418
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Is that a disqualification

419
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Here we are right this could this could be the moment

420
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
But no

421
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
Before the referee can get up

422
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Sean

423
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Whatever the brat

424
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
And then

425
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
Shawn puts rat in the Sharpshooter

426
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
Which is Brett's signature finishing move

427
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
Basically xian pretzels up Brett's legs and sit and within seconds

428
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
The bell rings

429
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,399
Sean slides out of the rain grab the belt

430
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Runs to the back takes off

431
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Things work a certain way in wrestling match

432
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Is right like

433
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
No one gets the first pick in the second match starts

434
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
And no one put someone in submission hold and they instantly submit a special agent did not appear like the time the mattress opposed

435
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
The crowd is kind of

436
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Shocked

437
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
It's strangely quiet

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
And

439
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,792
There's just one moment where the camera Zooms in on Brett face while he's lying

440
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Shut down

441
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
On the map looking up

442
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
And there is just as bizarre

443
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Amazing looking

444
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Confusion

445
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,312
Is an emotion that almost never exist in pro wrestling

446
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,224
There's a cartoon confusion of like everything's crazy in your arms are going like wild your eyeballs pop out of your head

447
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
The real confusion is one of the most compelling emotions of all

448
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
That's what you see on his face in its most

449
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Pure form

450
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:57,120
Genuine confusion

451
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
And then a Brett gets up puts his arms on the Rope looks down sees Vince McMahon

452
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
And

453
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Spits right in Vince's face

454
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
Event proceeds to get out of the ring

455
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
And basically destroy everything in

456
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
Because over the announcers table starts ripping it

457
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
He destroys the monitors

458
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
The headphones

459
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Krowd

460
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Eagles pretty nut

461
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
And maybe the moment

462
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
That truly

463
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Made you go what is happy

464
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Brett gets back into the ring

465
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
He takes his hand in the air

466
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
And draws with his finger

467
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
In the air as big as he can

468
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
W

469
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
See

470
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
W

471
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Which is where he was going to be leaving

472
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
To go work w

473
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
See

474
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
W

475
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
It keeps doing

476
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
Walking across the ring the signal

477
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
W

478
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
See

479
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
WW2 the crowd

480
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
After the match

481
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,560
Brett head back into the locker room looking for bench

482
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,656
Wavy

483
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
Tells the camera to shut off

484
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
And then

485
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
To make a long story short

486
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Pepsi clocks vintage

487
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Noxzema

488
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
Now the WWF has a real proud

489
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
Vince has a black eye

490
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
And the fourth wall has just been torn down and they need to figure out

491
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
How or if they're going to build it back up

492
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
And dumb

493
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
The next day

494
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
This again with the head writer at the time Vince

495
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
We had a television taping right after that you know you have Roar on Monday you know you do you have paper

496
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Review on Sunday you have Roar on Monday

497
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
They all had a little room to discuss their off

498
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
And Vince says that everybody in that

499
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
The first knee-jerk reaction is what we going to sweep this under the rug and not even talk about it I mean that that was almost

500
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,624
Just assumed because you have to understand there's this old principal in wrestling called Casey

501
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
And basically what this

502
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
Is is this loss

503
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Of the wrestling god passed down

504
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Since time eternal

505
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
That says

506
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
You don't talk about the fact

507
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
That it's fake

508
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
Everyone knows

509
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
That is scripted and that it's fake

510
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
But you damn well better not mention

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
Because everybody has a better time

512
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
When everyone is under the spell of it

513
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
And I was like wait a minute

514
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,808
Vince is walking around with a black eye

515
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,904
The boss has a black eye and one of the boys punch them in the face

516
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,536
Russo is saying I understand kayfabe but we have to address that we can't not acknowledged

517
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
And that doesn't have to be a problem

518
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
I can be an opportunity for

519
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
I mean it like I hate to say this but

520
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,824
Like it doesn't get any better than this Rousseau says this discussion got very

521
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
It was

522
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Passion-filled

523
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
And

524
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Indian

525
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
Nobody really knew what Vince McMahon was going to do

526
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,624
By the time Bret Hart steps Center Stage for his match up with Sean Monday mentally

527
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Vince McMahon decide

528
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
I'm going to break with caffe

529
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Now keep in mind

530
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,792
He's always been the owner of the organization but

531
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Very few people actually knew that

532
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Fans of professional wrestling

533
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
He was just in an ounce

534
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
That night

535
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,568
On his own TV show he comes out not as Vince McMahon the ringside announcer but

536
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Is Vince McMahon

537
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
The owner of the company

538
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Let's get right to the chase

539
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
7 days ago at the Survivor series

540
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Did you or did you not

541
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Screw

542
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Bret Hart

543
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Some would say

544
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
I screwed Bret Hart

545
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Bret Hart

546
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
But definitely tell you

547
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Ice

548
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll look at it from a different standpoint

549
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
I'll look at it

550
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
From the standpoint of

551
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
The referee did not screw Bret Hart

552
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Shawn Michael certainly did not screw Bret Hart

553
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Nor did Vince McMahon

554
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
I truly believe that Bret Hart

555
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Screwed

556
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Bret Hart

557
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
You can look in the mirror

558
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
And know that

559
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,528
I'm sure in some parts of country right now there's a collective groan that you orchestrated

560
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
The situation

561
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,392
And the fact that people are not going to understand

562
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
What you mean by Bret Hart

563
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Screwed Bret Hart so

564
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
What do you mean by that

565
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
There's a time-honored tradition

566
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
In the wrestling

567
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Someone is

568
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Leaving

569
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
They show the right amount of

570
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Respect

571
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
To the WWF superstars in this case

572
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Who helped make you

573
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
That's super

574
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,176
You show the proper respect to the organization

575
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Help you

576
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Become

577
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Who you are today

578
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Time-honored tradition

579
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
And Bret Hart

580
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Didn't want to honor

581
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Mapreduce

582
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
I know that's that was breast

583
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Decision

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Brett

585
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Screwed

586
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
And

587
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
Everything changed from that point on

588
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,240
And according to Peter

589
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,824
After the Montreal screwjob and after this speech

590
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
The writers of the WWF

591
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,944
Started blurring the line on a different level

592
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Vince McMahon the chairman of the WWE

593
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:08,160
He became mr. McMahon

594
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
The character the number one villain

595
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
In the company

596
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
There were no more ridiculous you know

597
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:23,776
Stupid unbelievable childish ignorant immature characters

598
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
Every character we had was basically

599
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
An extension of themselves

600
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
Cold Steve Austin was Steve Austin

601
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
1000 times magnified you know The Rock was Rocky made

602
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
My BF 100

603
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
X magnified and as a result that was the beginning

604
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
Of the biggest boom in the history of the wrestling business

605
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
As far as business goes this was

606
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
Huge for the WWF and Vince McMahon

607
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
They came roaring back in the ratings were they destroyed

608
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Ted Turner in the WCW

609
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
The one

610
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
And if you ask Vince Russo

611
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,112
Tell why this approach this new aesthetic was so

612
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Successful

613
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
He said simply

614
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
The truth

615
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,488
That was great TV

616
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Plain and simple

617
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
The fans just want something true just tell the fans

618
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
What

619
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Happen

620
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
But Peter says

621
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Things one and it's way more complicated

622
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
That is not just about

623
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
You still have

624
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,616
These writers who are scripting the show and wrestlers who are getting that

625
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
And following it

626
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
So it's not like

627
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
It's now a true world

628
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,272
I think it's something more like

629
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
There are these tiny injections of Truth

630
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
Into this world

631
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
In really unexpected Moana

632
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
What that does

633
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,512
Is it put everyone on high alert all the time

634
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
For those milk

635
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,376
And when everyone is on high alert for this moment all the time

636
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Every moment has the potential to be

637
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
True

638
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Has the potential to have a little bit of an injection into it

639
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
And when you are watching for those injections

640
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,664
It completely changes how you are engaging

641
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
With the Arts

642
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
With the entertainment

643
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,296
And that creates an entirely new type of fan

644
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
What they call a smart fan

645
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
A smart Marcus Mark as they're known

646
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
People who love the

647
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
Wrestling business but really love the behind the scenes of the business

648
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Smart bar

649
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Here's where you can get a little lingo

650
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,032
The lingo part of wrestling is a huge huge part of it and a mark is someone

651
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
Who doesn't know that wrestling is fake

652
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Or

653
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Using other

654
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
Piece of jogging here that it is a war

655
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:43,552
Yes of work is anything that's not real okay as opposed to a shoot

656
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Which is something that's real

657
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Like the Montreal screwjob yes

658
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Deschutes

659
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
By Def

660
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
In the ring

661
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Oh shoot you never happened

662
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
But

663
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,192
Then there's something called of course I'll work shoot

664
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,336
Emmett something that does happen once that where you

665
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Scripted to seem like a

666
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
It's totally unscripted

667
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
And it may even be real life they're injecting into it but it was plan

668
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,528
Rosedale all discuss that this is what would happen

669
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,600
And so watching wrestling becomes this game

670
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Of hunting for the truth

671
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
According to David Schumer

672
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
Any truth but the authentic

673
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Even if you know that it's fake

674
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
There's some point where the guys are really going at it in the ring

675
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
That you're just like

676
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Well maybe

677
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
It's real just that right there

678
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
And that's

679
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
What makes wrestling so powerful

680
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,104
What's the NeverEnding search for the reality

681
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
Within.

682
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,736
The fact that we get to blend these things together I mean

683
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
Another example that just fantastic

684
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
In the early 2000s

685
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
The edge

686
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Matt Hardy

687
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
And a girl named Lolita

688
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Lita

689
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
And Matt Hardy

690
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
Were legitimately in love

691
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
Dating for years

692
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,376
Edge and Matt Hardy were legitimately best for

693
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,032
And then

694
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Ended up with weed

695
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,896
Took his Best Friend's Girl

696
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Something that unfortunately

697
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
Happens in life sometimes

698
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
Lego WWE

699
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,624
And it was turned into a storyline

700
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,024
Manifold over women since the beginning of time and we haven't got to see an epic battle over one right now I find

701
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Credible

702
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
That you could

703
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,936
Go out into the rank and pretend

704
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
To beat the hell

705
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,800
Out of someone you want to beat the hell out

706
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
To know that you have to go out there

707
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,944
Work really hard against someone you legitimately hate

708
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
And also absolutely have to protect

709
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808
How can we not find that fast again

710
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
That's awesome that incredipets like watching Fleetwood Mac Go on tour

711
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Exactly

712
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
That's what I was going to say next

713
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
That's Andrew Marantz

714
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
The New Yorker and play all their songs cuz all their songs they all had these love quadrangles they all were married in

715
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:10,752
Left each other and wrote songs about I'm so pissed off at you because you left me for the guy to standing right there

716
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
And they go out on tour

717
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,872
And Lindsey Buckingham is standing right next to Stevie Nicks playing the song that he wrote

718
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
About you betrayed me I hate you so much

719
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Crazy

720
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
It right after 9

721
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Super fascinating

722
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah I just think there's a part of the

723
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Human brain that wants

724
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
To be

725
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Confused

726
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,672
Between those boundaries that wants to be

727
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,512
Slipping in between what's real what's fake to feel that confusion

728
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,632
I feel like that's why Jimmy Fallon was so successful on Saturday Night Live now because he was the greatest

729
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Sketch comedian that because he broke

730
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,520
A lot and you eat you can't do that in wrestling cuz those moments are the best

731
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
You have to save them

732
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
You have to say it

733
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,616
When people acknowledge a moment

734
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,456
And you can tell they look around at the crowd and their knowledge in like this is

735
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Or someone says one line

736
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,808
That everyone kind of knows like whoa

737
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Well that's kind of real

738
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Those moments are special

739
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
And you have to save them

740
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Hey what's up

741
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
He's on the way I'll be leaving

742
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Sargazo Usher awake

743
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,128
Well that's where the interesting thing is that after the Montreal screwjob

744
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
I'm a few weeks later Brett showed up on WCW television

745
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
And never really worked out for bread

746
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
In 1999

747
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Just two years into his contract with WCW

748
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
During a match he got kicked in the head

749
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
And suffered a severe

750
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
And it was the beginning of the end

751
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
That same year

752
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
Ladies and gentlemen something has gone terribly wrong

753
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Brett's brother

754
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Owen Hart

755
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Who was

756
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
Wrestling for the WWF

757
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
During one of his entrances

758
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
To the match

759
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
Entering from the ceiling

760
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
And

761
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
Something with the stunt went terribly wrong

762
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
And he

763
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
She fell

764
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
50 ft

765
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
Into the ring

766
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
And then he died

767
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
This is not a part of the show

768
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
This is real life

769
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,328
Owen Hart is being attended to right now by host

770
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
I went through

771
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Right away I said I could

772
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
I don't think I can ever go bad

773
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Bret Hart spoke with Terry Gross about a year after this incident single all these sort of contrived storylines of the

774
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Maven wrestling

775
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
You know this guy's going to come in and going to do that

776
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
He's going to say this about you earlier

777
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
I just thought everything you can possibly imagine is so

778
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
Ethically meaningless when you relate to

779
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
To the the real life horror would happen

780
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
My brother

781
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
He would retire

782
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Shortly after

783
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048

Friendly one

814
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
We're having an argument here I said

815
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
That when you get the hip hop in the wrestling

816
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
Novels about you getting a sort of a moment

817
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Contemporary MoMA

818
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
People are fascinated by authenticity

819
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
And then Jack my princess

820
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:41,248
I don't know maybe people always been interested in Oregon does it end

821
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
This is just comes with being human is nothing about now it's it just about us I mean that's that's

822
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Latest new in the sense

823
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
That

824
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
This generation of which we belong

825
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Has become very interested in these kind of question

826
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,680
But Bruce told me this preoccupation it's not really new in fact at least in book form

827
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
It goes

828
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
Back way longer than you.

829
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
1605

830
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:09,664
Well before wrestling on before Fleetwood Mac at before Jimmy Fallon begin laughing at his own jokes

831
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
There was Miguel Cervantes his book

832
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
Don Quixote the first book really is

833
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:20,160
About authenticity from the from the get-go you open this book

834
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,560
Find me the right way the narrator says I'm going to tell you a story which I actually gathered from other office

835
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
A bunch of different

836
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
Historical document so I'm not really the author

837
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,984
He says things like while some books a the first

838
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Adventure was this sin some statements that

839
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:43,200
Sweden from the start you have a very unreliable narrator to tell the story of a very unreliable

840
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,016
I completely Crazy Character Don Quixote

841
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296

In constant sorrow

845
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
Choke Don Quixote believe

846
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
City has been set on Earth

847

To rescue widows

Princesses

849
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,144
Mtnb kindorf he's like a delusion

850
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,240
Cuddly deleuze right he is he's essentially a guy who's who's

851
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,568
Read too many Zane Grey novels and decides he needs to be a cowboy

852
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,224
You think herds of sheep are attacking Army she thinks windmills are Giants at the same time he has this savvy

853
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,624
Assistance Sancho Panza who seems to know what's really going on and they're constantly arguing about what's real and what's not and then

854
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
In chapter 8

855
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Something really

856
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Spring-trap

857
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
One day

858
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza

859
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
Traveling down the road at me see a carriage

860
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
With a woman in

861
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,912
Just an ordinary woman doing

862
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Meet her husband

863
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,752
Donkey xote whoever for no reason at all

864
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,592
Decides that she is a woman in distress needs

865
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
To be rescued and he spies this man standing right next to the

866
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Cheese is a basque

867
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
Guy sees this guy and he decides

868
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:56,160
That he's a he's an enemy who needs to be confronted and so they start fighting

869
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
And the best was waiting for the sword also raised and in mid-swing when both swords are in the air than areas

870
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Gator stops and says

871
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
And I don't know where this goes from there

872
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
I've run out of material

873
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
You just rest stops near me

874
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
And this is what six

875
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
Steno something 1605

876
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
The book stop

877
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
Just stopping at the end of the well know so you turn the page and you're in a new chapter and now the narrator's just telling you how

878
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
Crazily enough he's out of business

879
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Shopping

880
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:37,376
NEC this pile of old papers and books together in a basket of these rifling through it

881
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,544
Dom quixote de la Mancha

882
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Apparently a real historical account in which the stupendous

883
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
Is concluded the problem was

884
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
He was an Arab

885
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,648
And so then he hires a local marisco who is a christianized more

886
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
To translate it for

887
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
I see you now got a guy

888
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Who's writing a book from historical sources he's run out of one he's found another but now that one has to be translated and on

889
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,728
Happy that you frequently inserts commentary about the translation and we'll say stuff like

890
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
Well city of netty says this

891
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
But we all know that Arabs can't be trusted so

892
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
You don't take that for what that's worth

893
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
The meeting and I'm picking weight

894
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
This was written in 6

895
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Pino

896
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:30,880
What do people make of a book that didn't seem to have any author I had author of him also, feel like where they

897
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
What time the book was a bestseller

898
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
It was huge lollipop

899
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,608
Apparently people found all these layers annies ambiguities a laugh

900
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
They gobbled rapidly leftists as hard as they could

901
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,592
This is Howard mancing Ristorante Skyler at Purdue was translated into English in 1612 in

902
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:55,455
Two French in 1614 into Italian and 1622 everybody with it

903
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,295
Including in the New World by the way how many copies of the first edition of Don Quixote

904
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Worshipped

905
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
To The Colony

906
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,951
So the book is a worldwide bestseller maybe the first of the

907
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
Time in ten years later

908
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
10 years

909
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
Waiter Cervantes write

910
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Sequel

911
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,167
Which kicks up this narrative weirdness to a completely new

912
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,751
In part 2/2

913
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
He introduces a new character named Samson Carrasco

914
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
He actually visits don't Quixote and son

915
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
Don't you tell them that

916
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Part 1 exist

917
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
It's a bestseller

918
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,927
In the very early chapters of part 2 donkey healthiest would be like walking up the Huckleberry Finn to know by the way you living here in Hannibal

919
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
But you're now a famous boy

920
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,071
Everybody he meets knows who he is because they've read part 1

921
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
And now it gets even stranger because in real life

922
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
During that 10 years that it took Cervantes to write his second book of person who goes by the pseudonym of Alonso Fernando

923
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
Disable you neither

924
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,871
Published his own second part of Don Quixote before

925
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Cervantes could get his own psyche

926
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,223
Wait so this is this is an unofficial

927
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,575
Part 2 today we recognize it as a sort of fanfiction or

928
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,695
Or somebody attempting to steal George Lucas's idea and come up with their own Star Wars

929
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,767
Installment so there's this unauthorized part 2

930
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,351
Floating around Miguel Cervantes he's very annoyed by it I'm assuming

931
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
In here

932
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Official sequel to Don Quixote

933
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
There's this scene where

934
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:27,359
Donkey xote is that man in any overhears a character talking about his relationship with with

935
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
This

936
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
Supposed donquixote wait for this guy this guy

937
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,527
At Simon Adler deciding on the interview with me this guy

938
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,575
Existed in the

939
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
A Quixote number two

940
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,207
Is it character in that and is now appearing in the real

941
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,535
Tell Jennifer to Cervantes Cervantes steals him

942
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,583
If you steal my character I'll steal yours

943
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,703
Now you got the real donkey or that he's bumping into a character

944
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
Stolen from a fake

945
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,103
Book of Don Quixote so so why don't you decide to confront this

946
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:05,759
Images right up to the guy thing says

947
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
Unfortunate

948
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
The climax of that scene which is just wonderful is he

949
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
He

950
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,839
Forces this other character who has stolen from the unauthorized seek

951
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,727
To admit that the donkey xote he knows from the unauthorized sequel is not the real one

952
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,287
And that the one he's currently talking to is the real one

953
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
For the sake of what you owe to your being a gentleman

954
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,015
Please make a statement to the forces him to sign an affidavit

955
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
3 bus Sim

956
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
In-N-Out

957
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,023
But you got a story about a guy that then becomes a part 2

958
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Dory

959
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,399
About the story about the guy including false guys inside the story about the

960
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
Guys from another book

961
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,847
So why even bother

962
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
If there's anything like this come before they know he's really sort of inventing this whole meta-narrative

963
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Game that it is so Poppy

964
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
Meta-narrative what

965
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
What is

966
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
What up until that point most

967
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
Stories are

968
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Simply

969
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
They purport to be what they are I'm telling you a

970
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
But donkey xote

971
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
Pretends to be something other than what it is it really is the start of modernity

972
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Our modern sense of the world

973
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
CU CHI with Chad Bennett this is like this is this is not

974
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:36,639
Waxed and waned this particular ear

975
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,223
Don Quixote has been read by different generations for different breeds

976
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,295
Bruce says he thinks the people who were reading the book original

977
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,695
Time of survivors they actually reveled in in the the multi levels of fiction

978
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
During the romantic. And and well into the early 20th century people were less interested in all these narrative layers

979
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
They were more just

980
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,519
Thrilled by the Romantic Don Quixote or the dreamer Don Quixote this generation of which we belong

981
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
Has become very interested in this

982
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
Terrain that Cervantes charted a long time ago

983
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:15,295
See it in the cinema of the late 90s kid movies like The Matrix and then later at a patient about inception

984
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,599
Exploring the concept of a dream

985
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
See it in Seinfeld

986
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
Who's going to be on TV the following

987
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,167
Is this comedian Jerry Seinfeld who's playing a character that happens to be called Jerry Seinfeld

988
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
Who's making a show

989
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
Within the show

990
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
Black octopus

991
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,799
Who's Jerry Seinfeld answer you have

992
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Reality nest

993
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
3 *

994
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,919
But I guess I'm interested in this idea of why is

995
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
How is this happening again and why is it happy

996
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
But my sense of things is

997
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
That

998
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,623
Both of these moments are moments of intellectual crisis

999
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Back in Cervantes time

1000
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Coming out of the Renaissance

1001
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
You have all this new scientific knowledge

1002
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,583
That is calling into question the foundation

1003
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
That everybody was building their life

1004
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,703
Suddenly the Earth is no longer the center of the universe

1005
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
It's now just one planet among several orbiting the Sun

1006
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,359
So you have people coming to terms with

1007
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
A worldview that they can no longer sustain

1008
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
An astronaut's now in the last hundred years

1009
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,575
You have Darwinism you have relativity you have quantum physics

1010
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,903
Any cognitive scientists are telling us that we have no free will because they cancel

1011
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Chart

1012
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
The chemical reaction that happens milliseconds

1013
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,535
Before we we think we decide to do something

1014
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,631
All of these things tell us that the world that we think we see is not what it is

1015
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,215
And I think that inspires people to then start asking these questions

1016
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
If what I'm seeing is not real

1017
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
What is

1018
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
I who am I

1019
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
An enticing to a great extended its

1020
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
It's a reaction to a moment of intellectual crime

1021
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,295
Wait but okay let's say that I like professional wrestling a lot

1022
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
I don't know anything about any of the research you're telling me about why the hell do I like professional wrestling in why did I lie

1023
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
Like it more when they started blurring these lines

1024
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
Hard question

1025
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
Well I would say

1026
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Humans

1027
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,679
Are humans and one of the things that we do is

1028
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,031
Is it as opposed to as far as we know what other animals on this planet do is

1029
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
We are aware of our own contingency

1030
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Meaning we can imagine

1031
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:20,479
Radically different possibilities we can imagine a world where we don't exist

1032
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,111
Or maybe we only think we exist I can remember being a child's 4 and 5 years old

1033
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
And

1034
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
Going to a fabric store with my mother and there were two mirrors set against opposite walls and I was just fascinated

1035
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
Standing in between them and watching the infinite regress

1036
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Go in each Direction

1037
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,983
You know when I have not even started kindergarten yet so I think

1038
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
I think humans have this

1039
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:49,407
Fascination with infinite regress and with embeddedness and with the questions that it forces you to consider

1040
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,711
Like weird is everything

1041
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Begin Again

1042
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
Where does it all come from

1043
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
Me the question at the heart of

1044
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,415
Donkey xote realizing that he's a character in a novel is

1045
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
Who stands above you

1046
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
The author

1047
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,839
Stands above you until that author has a kind of Godlike relationship to you

1048
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
But that very question starts

1049
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,215
To make you ask who stands above that author

1050
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:18,079
And if you start asking that question it goes on forever in every direction

1051
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
Thank you to Rupert Boyd for coming and playing the Spanish

1052
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319

He's really good

1057
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Okay

1058
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
Well I guess we should go then we should go by goodbye

1059
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:54,751
