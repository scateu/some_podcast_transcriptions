1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
Okay

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Either

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Bobert

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Hello okay there you are

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm jabbing Rod I'm rubber Coches is Radiolab yes sir and so okay we're going to continue with one more episode

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
Load from from the series on race

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
What you did for somebody else

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,472
I was kind of for somebody else but also for us at the same time

11
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
It always kind of squishy

12
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
To be honest

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
I've produced a four-part series along with Focus Features Stitcher eliminate house that was

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
About the history of conversion therapy in America

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
That's people who are gay who are being pushed to our ass to I want to be straight yes and sometimes it's a therapy

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488
Type situation sciency sometimes it's a church type situation

17
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Here's a few the funny thing Robert

18
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
You would think it's kind of

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
You think it doesn't happen a lot right

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,472
These days I would think certainly less

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Certainly less than

22
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Before well

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
There was a survey done recently

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Bye

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,968
Buy a group of UCLA at the Williams Institute in conjunction with Gallup Gallup polling

26
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
They did a survey that looked at

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
Of the people in America who identify as LGBT

28
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Kill which is about

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
4.5% broccoli

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
13 million people

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
How many of those people have gone through something like conversion therapy

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
And the number

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Completely shocking

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Shockingly small so I can

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,264
Well, almost 700,000 people

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,128
In the 1970's and 80's in Swan or also recently

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
Recently this is a survey is done in 2012

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Actually give you a sense of scale

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Okay

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
700000 people

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
That is the

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Equivalent of the city of Boston

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
That's the number of people were talking about that's a lot of freaking adorable

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
No to your question

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
You would think it would be mostly older folks yes

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
From the days when it was

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
An Abomination and dial no longer really for many family it was actually

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,640
Equally prevalent in all age groups in the survey found that

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Just as many young people

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Champions

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
We're being put through these kind of programs

52
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
As people of older Generations

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
That is

54
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
The prevalence wasn't going down

55
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
You know if anything like just as lgbtq

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
People are being embraced

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
The Wider culture

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
There has been a kind of

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Silently entrenchment

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
In certain communities America

61
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:56,640
It said that was part of the whole reason to do this project is that there's this thing happening that we're not really looking at and

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
History to it

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
Troubling but also kind of fascinating

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,904
So I want to play the final episode in the four-part series as it deals with

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
Well it deals with one of the

66
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Central guys

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
In that history

68
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
This mean characters that you found

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
This is a really

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
Complex will you turn this thing

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Well he

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Oh

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
And then I don't know I don't know what your face will look like at the end of this

74
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
He has so um

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
Purchase a few things before we start this this whole project was done in conjunction with the Focus Features film boy erased which

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is out now

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
And that film was based

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
On a wonderful Memoir by guy named Eric Conley

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
And this

80
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Story

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,312
What's the story everybody told us we had to tell if we were going to do a series about conversion therapy in America

82
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
And it's about a guy named

83
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Smith

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
News cameras started showing up

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Bull horns came out

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
And all of a sudden I heard

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
John smid

88
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
We know you're in there

89
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
John smid we know you're here it was as though a torpedo

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Adjust hit the side of her ship

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
The ship the John Smith captain

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Before was torpedoed what's the largest ex-gay Ministry in America it's called

93
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Call Doug loving action

94
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
For almost 25 years

95
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
1994 2008 if you are an Evangelical Christian

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,999
You had a gay son or daughter and you wanted to convert them to straight

97
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
You might have sent them to John

98
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
4

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Maybe $7,000 he

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,519
Would run them through his program I want you to tell him how he is the guy in boy erased

101
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
The torment scary clown

102
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
Tell him how you hate it for the things that he's the way you sit down

103
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Sit down but I'm not angry

104
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
I don't like my life to be painted as a villain

105
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
And that's kind of the way I feel about this movie it's like

106
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
I don't like it

107
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
It's uncomfortable

108
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,191
I don't like the movie I don't like the book I don't like what people are saying

109
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
I don't like hearing Garrett talk about it

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
I don't like it

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
It's uncomfortable

112
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
At the same time

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
There is

114
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Ruth

115
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
In that I was a 4Runner

116
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
And a spokesperson and a national and international leader that said you must eradicate homosexuality for me

117
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
That's just

118
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
The price

119
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
These days John Smith is living a very different life

120
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
My life has been reinvented several times

121
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
Majorly reinvented he now lives in Paris Texas with his husband Larry

122
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
Andy makes furniture

123
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
Producer shemale holy and I paid him a visit

124
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Corner of our house

125
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,159
John and Larry live in a tiny one story house bordering an enormous Horse Farm

126
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,511
So what you see is we watch the garage out of his house into the garage is

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Rolling Hills in One Direction

128
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Epic Texas Flatlands at another and a sky that is so big it kind of hurts your head the shop itself is it in here with the car

129
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
It's as if the divided shop okay the cars are in the next space John also collects and restores old cars

130
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Oh wow look at this

131
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
I'm I'm a person that uses

132
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,111
Every scrap that I can I have a lot of used would old would like over there is a whole bunch of

133
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
These days

134
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
What does

135
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,767
Set of trying to eradicate homosexuality

136
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
John Willis spend his days

137
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,239
Taking are old copies of Reader's Digest books and

138
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
Carving them in the letters of the alphabet

139
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
This large band saw a really

140
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
That's a nice refined Edge there's no frayed edges

141
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
Or a he'll also and I'm going to router these out

142
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,207
Do carpentry work for local designers I know he'll make a call in

143
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Paint it white

144
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
When you make it something what are you thinking about

145
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
The most the time

146
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
I'm I'm thinking about relationships I'm thinking about life

147
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
People

148
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
History future

149
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Little Einsteins is processing painful things

150
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
You know difficult things

151
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
How to think about John smid

152
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
Is a difficult question he is undeniably warm and funny and honest

153
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
And engaging at the same time

154
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
Many people told us before we came

155
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Don't forget this is a guy

156
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Who ran a program

157
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Where

158
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
People in the program tried to commit suicide

159
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
In some cases

160
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
And now that he's out himself and married to a man and vehement Lee opposed to the whole idea of conversion therapy

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
It does beg the question what do we do with that passed

162
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
How should we think about it

163
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Is he allowed to just move on

164
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Would you grow up

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
I was raised in Omaha Nebraska

166
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
It was 1959

167
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Life was the 50s life was good

168
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
All the moms walked up and down the street in their Shirtwaist dresses and had coffee with each other I mean it was a stereo

169
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Typical

170
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
19

171
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
50s

172
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
Suburban American neighborhood experience

173
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
And I remember

174
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
Feeling at 5 I remember sitting back in our backyard on a summer morning

175
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
School's Out

176
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
Sitting in the play sandbox

177
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
And feeling the warm sun

178
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
And I remember just feeling

179
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Life's good

180
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
I was so at peace

181
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
This is one moment of calm he says

182
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Or he didn't have to worry about who he was

183
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Know the story as it goes from here

184
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Of John becoming

185
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
And then Unbecoming the

186
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Elvis of the ex-gay movement

187
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Is complicated to say the least

188
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
You could start the story in the 4th grade

189
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
I remember in fourth grade

190
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
Having an emotional affair

191
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,839
With Steve I wanted to carry his books he had a broken arm

192
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
I wanted to hold his hand cause I was a gay boy

193
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:20,543
But I didn't know how to work that through or what is a little boy in that situation say to myself I didn't have words

194
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Then there was fifth grade

195
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
For the first time in school gets a male teacher all my teachers were females

196
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
And all of a sudden this male teacher

197
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Remember just

198
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
I just

199
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Fantasizing

200
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,135
Just looking at him being drawn to him being attracted to his maleness

201
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Not knowing what to do with that

202
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Jumping forward a bit dated

203
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,327
Several girls in high school end up marrying a girl named Chris

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
I was 17 16

205
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Like him

206
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
Chantel family light alcoholic father parents are divorced

207
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Healthiest kind of got each other

208
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
And we

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Created to children

210
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
And then you get to the first in a series of

211
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Violent shifts

212
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
In John Smith's life

213
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:06,367
Many years later when he was like firmly embedded in the ex-gay movement end up preaching against homosexuality

214
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
He would give a sermon that's her

215
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Talked about this moment

216
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
I just want to share a little bit about my personal story so you know who I am and where I'm coming from

217
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,887
And I describes of being 23 newly married with kids

218
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
And then falling into the

219
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Funk like suddenly be very uncertain about his marriage

220
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
About the future

221
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,199
At the time he was working in a department store and that he meets a guy named Leonard

222
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
How the enemy Works in our lives and he works in those

223
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Does intimate times of Darkness

224
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
A secrecy it's not in the light it's not above board It's Always Somewhere Sinister that he sneeze

225
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
610 and 1 Friday night

226
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,423
9:30 at night my wife was bowling I was taking care of the kids Leonard call me I'm at the bar

227
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Why don't you come over and we can talk

228
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,847
Well my head strategically placed himself at a bar right across the street from where I live

229
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
And I found out later that

230
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,783
He was already surmising what I was looking for what I was curious about where I was headed in his mine

231
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
I want to cross the street that evening ended up in a very

232
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
Mutually seductive homosexual encounter

233
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
I came home from that

234
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,863
4 in the morning which is again something I never did I never ever went out and stayed out

235
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
Of course my wife wasn't

236
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Stupid she knew that

237
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Why was he out so late what was going on

238
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,335
So she began to ask me questions what went on and immediately went to her and I said

239
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Chris I'ma

240
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm gay

241
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
You see how quick that identity got stuck

242
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
I had one sexual encounter

243
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
1

244
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Outside of

245
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,207
Marital sex which was the only other experience I've ever had sexually

246
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
One sexual encounter

247
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
And I'm Signed Sealed Delivered

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
I'm gay and I want a divorce

249
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
What what do you think when you hear that now

250
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
My first thought was my verbage

251
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
And the way I described that story

252
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
And the way I would describe it if today would be so violently different

253
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,479
Those terms for inflammatory I mean I I filtered that story

254
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Through

255
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
My

256
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Theology at that time

257
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,463
I walked away from that marriage abandon my children in homosexual adultery

258
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
And drove into headlong

259
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Full force

260
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
The homosexual subculture

261
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
I live in an apartment building free for the gay businesses

262
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,519
Anyone who wasn't familiar with or didn't like my homosexuality

263
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
I just crossed him off the list

264
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,455
In a later TV interview John would say that during this. He even became the guy

265
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
That young gay men who are new in town would call

266
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Assertive

267
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,207
Get initiate I had taken people to the gay bars for their first time I was instrumental in helping people involve

268
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,839
Call themselves for years I lived in that lifestyle four years of active Pursuit and all along

269
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
Thinking in my head I'm looking for monogamy

270
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
I'm looking for a life partner

271
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,079
I'm looking for that one person that can satisfy all my needs and never let me down

272
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
What makes John's backstory

273
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
So

274
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Interesting and also difficult to wrap your head around

275
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Are these wildly different polls

276
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,183
He travels between in one life I mean he starts off living the sort of 50s American Suburban dream wife two kids

277
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Swings into the gay subculture as he calls it

278
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
And then

279
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
As he puts it what happened was he started to get his heart broke

280
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
A lot the first guy that I lived with

281
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
I mean I just

282
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,823
I just really loved him as a 20-something year old.can

283
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,199
He came home one day and he says I can't be with you I'm a size queen and you don't measure up

284
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,087
Galaxy told him you're not enough of a man down there for me that was a shocking

285
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
Deeply deeply wounding moment

286
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
He said he struggled with his confidence

287
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
And he got into a series of

288
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,583
A very bad dysfunctional relationships

289
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
Began to feel like something was wrong with him

290
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
And it was at that point

291
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
With this

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
4 year experience in the gay culture

293
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Where a girl I worked with

294
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
The time he was working for the railroad as a clerk

295
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
She was an Evangelical Christian

296
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
Started talking with me about Jesus in the Bible

297
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,623
And she was very open about her own struggles very vulnerable with me in

298
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
She invited me to church

299
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,999
And kept inviting me to church then eventually I went

300
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,519
It was a Christian Revival is church services the kind where people speak in tongues talk about the devil a lot

301
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,151
So I went and sure enough I was sitting in a few and this guy was speaking and I don't know what the heck was talking about

302
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Because God was too busy speaking to me personally

303
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295
I was sitting back in this. I'll never forget God said

304
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
John

305
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,975
You don't have to live this way any longer

306
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Who was attempted mean

307
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
This is always the last John like what

308
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
How does explain that moment now

309
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
Because I mean that follows really flows from that moment it is honest as I can be about it

310
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Because I

311
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
I don't really understand it myself either but

312
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
As much as I can process it it was built on

313
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
The hope of

314
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Not the

315
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Spirits of

316
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
He told me later that no

317
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
The conversion of it that God's voice in his head that he can't

318
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Explain but

319
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
All the moments after suddenly having this whole new belief system

320
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Reframed everything

321
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
First of all he was Reborn

322
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
To literally everything before that point was no longer important it was only about what comes after

323
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
And also he now had this book

324
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,247
Which seemed to say that the way he just was with a sin

325
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Wish you would think

326
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
Would want to hear but

327
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
He said it was actually a relief to hear that

328
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
Cuz he can now take all of those really

329
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,607
Hard questions about himself and who he was a man and he can now put it into a box called sin

330
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
And say to himself oh

331
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
That's why I was feeling so bad

332
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Because I was committing sin

333
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
It was

334
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,407
What I was doing it's not necessarily who I am it was my behavior and that

335
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Can change

336
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Believe

337
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
That all this pain

338
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Jesus

339
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Could heal

340
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
And he could bring meaning and sense and comfort and peace

341
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Into my life

342
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
And so in another violent shift

343
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
John Smith becomes

344
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,423
Really only one of two people I've ever heard of to come out of the closet

345
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Then go back in

346
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,079
That's going to the church regularly I felt free iFit liberated

347
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Tell him that

348
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,943
Are clown minutes yeah I was a clown I became a clown you are clown yes

349
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
I was rainbow the Clown

350
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
How do you say that so matter-of-factly yeah well we were we were with it it was it you was it you

351
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Christian song yes

352
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
In my clownstick was I was walking with an umbrella

353
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Because I was high I was underneath the clouds of life in the rain

354
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,447
And my had a trick umbrella that when I would shake it it would fall

355
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,335
And it put it down in the rainbow would come out the promises of God's future it was my testimony kind of a story

356
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
Of how I came out from under the rain clouds and found the Sun

357
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,063
I made all the wigs for the clowns and I made the props and it was really a significant

358
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Two and a half years

359
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
Of my life when I didn't have any outside pressures

360
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,047
Said it was a little bit like that moment when he was 4 he was totally at peace super happy but then

361
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Starts getting lonely

362
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
I needed a companion

363
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,007
Side dated a couple of girls and those things didn't succeed and finally I met Valene

364
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
And we started kind of dating and I fell

365
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
He said initially things were going well and he felt like I'll maybe I can change

366
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Maybe I have

367
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
But then as he describes it

368
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
That funk return

369
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
What does old feelings but even more unspoken than that this is the kind of panic would come up and I started feeling

370
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
I'm really really scared

371
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,143
While I was in that place

372
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
Today on family talk I heard

373
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
A radio program welcome everyone to this edition of family talk

374
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
Focus on the family James Dobson

375
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,991
GameStops in by the way is maybe one of the most influential Evangelical voices of last 50 years

376
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
SN

377
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
Hugely popular radio show today we're addressing the tough subject of same-sex attraction which affects Mill

378
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Millions of people and their families

379
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
And the guest on the guest on the radio program was Barbara Johnson

380
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
Barbara Johnson was a mom of a gay son at the end of that program

381
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Can and do

382
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,871
They offered information sheets on ex-gay Ministry

383
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
John says they basically said

384
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
For all you who are struggling with same-sex feelings there's a program out there

385
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,343
They can help you first time I've ever heard gay anything in the context of Christian anything

386
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
So I said focus on the family a letter

387
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,231
And to make a long story short he ends up getting connected with

388
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,327
The guy who many people sort of believed to be the father

389
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
The spiritual Godfather of the X game with

390
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
I had just given up on the church

391
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,519
We talked about it a bit in episode 1 like John

392
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
Frank Worthen was a guy who had been in the closet

393
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
Come out of the closet but then at a low Point Heard a Voice from God God say I want your back

394
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,087
They went back in the closet 1973

395
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Right in the middle of

396
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Jesus movement

397
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,303
Frank starts going to church and after service one day after church

398
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Three young men came to visit me

399
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
And they were all gay

400
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
And they said that I heard you made a recommitment

401
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,823
Price that you're leaving the gay lifestyle and we would like to leave at 2

402
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
And so that kind of

403
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
You know within three days we have little group going

404
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,831
Has Frank Worthen tells it that's how the ex-gay movement began casually one day after church

405
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
Well the members named at love and action we did feel that it was

406
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,560
God's answer to the APA saying homosexuality is normal

407
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
And God is saying

408
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
Not really

409
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
What is referring to their is sort of the beginning of the scientific Community washing their hands of the whole idea

410
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
Deification which we talked about in the last episode but we're not Christian they don't know what they're saying

411
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
John's at the time that

412
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
That really spooked a lot of evangelicals this scientific communities were accepting homosexuality and they were saying that it's

413
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,440
It's not a disorder anymore they were removing it from the DSM 3 which is why we need

414
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
To do what we're doing

415
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
It was very explicit in your mind oh yeah

416
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
Indicates John and Frank Rosen and Frank's wife Anita were then they started corresponding and I said I was capable

417
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
I was trustworthy

418
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
They could count on me

419
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Can you help me what do you have

420
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
And so need to call me she says we

421
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384

And so

426
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Begins a

427
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Very bizarre very dramatic

428
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,792
25 year Odyssey to try and Stamp Out homosexuality

429

442
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
So did something

443
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

444
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you

445
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
Suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score or maybe the kids in math class you noticed there

446
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Reading music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

447
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
Does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

448

Radiolab.org Brilliance thank you so much

450
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
This is Radiolab listening to episode 4 of unerased on Radiolab

451
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
Let's get back to the story of John Smith at this point in the story

452
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
John is searching for a way to rid himself of

453
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Gay attractions

454
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
To make himself attracted to his

455
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Wife is second wife

456
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
It does end up marrying a second time

457
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,120
He goes to San Rafael California to volunteer for new ministry

458
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
Find by Frank Anita Worthen

459
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,824
That promise is a solution they loved me I was became an office manager I managed all kinds of stuff I became senior housing

460
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,944
Manager decides to go to the Philippines on sort of a missionary trip

461
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
And

462
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
John takes over the ministry

463
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
The one he left

464
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,976
We completely redecorated moved everything around changed everything I mean like

465
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,048
I'm in the moment Frank flew out

466
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
Which was a symbol of this is now mine

467
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,216
And here's where John's story

468
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
Morphs into something quite different

469
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
Something much bigger

470
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,848
Any darker than just one man's

471
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Journey towards

472
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Accepting who he is

473
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
As John tells it

474
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
The moment he showed up

475
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
Love and action

476
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Car wind

477
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Program 6 months after I got there

478
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Which is insane

479
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Start appearing on

480
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Fairies talk shows

481
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,888
Homosexuality from my experience that stand out of a need to know I was okay as a man

482
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
And he very quickly realized his story

483
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,544
Was like Rocket Fuel I had a phenomenal

484
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Miraculous

485
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Testimony

486
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,176
What's the name of that phone interview I mean I was one of those people

487
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Who had a dramatic trance

488
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,600
Information from where I was one day I'm sleeping with my gay partner

489
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,976
And the next day I'm 100% sold out to God committed baseball so people

490
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Saw my life

491
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
As

492
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,376
The dark vs the light it was almost like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus

493
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,984
He said people would come up to me Christian conference isn't and say that they were actually jealous of

494
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
I want to see all the power in his own story

495
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,128
We became much more extroverted as a minister

496
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Perhaps as a result

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
Love and action started to gain Converse

498
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:33,344
By the week to the point where they could no longer fit in the small Church in San Rafael and so

499
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
1994

500
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
They go off in search of a bigger Church

501
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
We got to Memphis Memphis Tennessee

502
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
Big church large community they hire staff at this point John is flying high and love an action

503
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,664
Who was advertising this is daggering success rates was something they heard from Garrard Conley

504
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
7% success rate of conversion from gay to straight I internally

505
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,392
Underneath It All while I couldn't verbalize it

506
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,768
I had to admit somewhere in me that we were not seeing success

507
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
We were not winning

508
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
They were successful why they were in the program

509
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,400
As soon as they leave bone

510
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Bad Fallen

511
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:26,080
I knew it wasn't working but I couldn't admit that so the only way I could have knowledge that would be to

512
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,384
. something new that might work better

513
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
So when he got to Memphis he decided to go a totally different route

514
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
He figured if people were quote relapsing

515
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,648
Which they were let me draw inspiration from other modality

516
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
They also have to deal with the problem of people relapsing

517
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
And so

518
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
He ended up visiting a

519
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
Local drug and Rehab Center

520
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
It's called second chance

521
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
It's a drug and alcohol rehab for teenagers

522
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
Wonderful success rate so we all talked about it as a staff and we sat down and we said we really think they have something.

523
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
Valuable we adopted their philosophy

524
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:06,016
They decided they would Define homosexuality sexuality

525
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,160
And maybe they can just treat it with something like 12 step the 12-step seemingly were they the best way

526
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,976
To rid people of drug and alcohol abuse and had

527
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
A track record

528
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,608
And I'm thinking well maybe that'll if if homosexuality is an addiction

529
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
We need to remove the homosexual

530
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Drug

531
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,776
Long enough for these people to detox

532
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
From it

533
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
It's so starting in 1994 and going through his whole 14-year stint at the Memphis Clinic John basically

534
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,624
Implemented this system where young men women would come in anything that they had

535
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
That could be remotely construed as

536
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
Which we call deaf eyes Falls images

537
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
There homosexual

538
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Look

539
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,680
There homosexual books there homosexual Concepts friends people associations

540
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,288
Drug and alcohol recovery centers have seen these things as contraband

541
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
And it has to be removed

542
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
You big can't come here with that

543
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,944
They have to be separated from its so they can

544
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Think without it

545
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Because it's their coping mechanisms

546
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
It's their addiction

547
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
After they were then separated from their

548
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
Homosexual paraphernalia or what have you

549
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
Clients within go through

550
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
You know endless rounds of

551
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
Pseudo-scientific

552
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Talk therapy

553
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
And so it became this elaborate 12-step program where we had to write down

554
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Every week

555
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,592
Three different sexual experiences that we had

556
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
In Our Lifetime

557
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
And do a moral inventory about it

558
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Each one

559
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:45,600
Mrs Peterson Toscano we heard of it from him in episode 1 he did to stencil of a notch

560
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Would be

561
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Well beyond just

562
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,976
Physically having sex with someone but a fantasy

563
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
An obsession over someone a romantic

564
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
Crush that you had

565
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:02,240
An encounter you may have had with an inanimate object this very varied like

566
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
Strange language to talk about the stuff and some of it was like we talking about and they were like you know

567
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
You know did you ever use shaving cream

568
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
When you masturbate it would like I was like no but now I'm thinking of that thank you for that

569
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
You're writing about these

570
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,744
Really intense sexual encounters and it becomes like a butterfly

571
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:30,912
Can vinegar Patrice played out in your analyzing at and dissecting it and tearing it apart

572
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,496
Peterson also told us that there were times when this these kind of techniques

573
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Tipton to just

574
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Abject

575
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Cruelty

576
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Sometimes they would be asked to confess

577
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
Some of these stories directly to

578
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,480
Two parents on friends and family night

579
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
He told us about a mock

580
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:52,160
Funeral that was stage 4 young man named Erin oprea Lee Peterson remembers candles I'm not sure if I remember that or not but maybe there were

581
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
It it's one of these

582
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
Pretty traumatic things that I didn't ever really want to

583
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
Bring back to the light

584
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,400
This is Erin because I'm up he says he is okay talking about it now

585
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Special senses

586
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,264
Scene in the boy erased film besides see what happens if Aaron had

587
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Vegas relapse

588
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
Fallen or whatever with someone outside of the program again

589
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
This is how they stay today

590
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
So they asked him to lie on a table closes eyes they brought end

591
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
That's some pretty Gotti

592
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Flowers and their office

593
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
John Smith going to laugh at me for saying that but I did not like the flower arrangements so that anyway but I do

594
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
You know that I was on a table

595
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
I got my eyes Riverside

596
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
And then they wanted

597
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
All the people in the program to say their goodbyes to me

598
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Wow

599
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Yeah

600
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Come on

601
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Really

602
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,408
This is what he said directive by the professional counselor that was our Consulting psychologist

603
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
They made this up

604
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,528
And he said you should do that he said the reason we're doing this is because

605
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
This man

606
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
Has had a pattern of

607
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
Destructive Behavior he says it was just something that was suggested then by an actual counselor who used to he said this is called

608
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Stop therapy

609
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
He said the guy suggested it they did it and it also just seemed like another one of those things I could borrow from dropping and Rehab

610
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
Clinics that apparently do this sometimes if somebody's

611
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Using drugs in it

612
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
I dying

613
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Be Scared Straight

614
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
I don't know when we were

615
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
Chastised

616
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
4 Hour rules

617
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Which we

618
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
And I was

619
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
And I have been

620
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
I know I understand that now

621
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
But we were chastised for it

622
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
And we would internally say

623
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,864
We are not doing anything different than the local successful drug rehab

624
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
John says he knew

625
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,752
That some of these techniques were confrontational maybe even traumatic but it's a

626
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Time

627
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
I believe that the time

628
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,384
That a temporary pain

629
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
To rid your life of the horror of homosexuality

630
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Is worth it

631
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
He gets me upset thinking about it too just

632
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
How

633
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
Crazy some of us got there this is Peterson Toscano against XE him in a film made by director Moore

634
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
Fox

635
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
Who is nice enough to let us use the footage

636
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
One of my closest friends there

637
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Attempted suicide and dumb

638
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
I found his truck at the end of the driveway

639
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
With all these photographs of his children

640
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
And he had on this note

641
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,832
He had this noted just about what a horrible person he was and

642
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
He gave up with any such a bad person

643
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
We took all these pills and went off

644
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
To the fields to die

645
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,192
Peterson told me he knows at least five students

646
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:49,312
11 action who at one point either in the program or afterwards attempted suicide

647
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Smith himself

648
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,480
Offered a story of going with a colleague to a Christian Conference in California looking on the wall

649
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Sing a plaque

650
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,904
With the name of a former student this room dedicated in the memory of David bilbrey bilbrey King

651
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
I said Allen

652
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
What happened

653
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Citi credit suicide

654
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
5 years ago

655
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
I asked John about a letter that he wrote

656
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
In mm

657
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
10 where he

658
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
I know this is jumping for just a bit but where he ultimately

659
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
Apologizes for everything he's done

660
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,736
And below that written apology a comment or said

661
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
I don't accept your apology

662
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
And then they listed a series of names

663
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
In-Shape

664
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
17 committed suicide

665
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Dominic Crouch 15 jump

666
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
Tua stats from the six-story building

667
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
Billy Lucas 15 hung himself in his family's Farm

668
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,144
Asher Brown 13 shot himself with his father's gun

669
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Seth Walsh

670
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,240
Hang himself from a tree in his backyard didn't die immediately

671
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
You've taken to the hospital where he placed on life support. 9 days later

672
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
Jeanine Blanchette 21 pills

673
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
Tyrell Williams 1700 self in his bedroom closet

674
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
About 20 suicides no not all of them happened at 11

675
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
What are you

676
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
How do you hold that

677
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
How do you

678
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,744
The only thing I could say to that is in in all honesty

679
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,864
In some levels of this process I have to

680
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
Use some denial

681
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
I have to

682
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
I don't mean denial it didn't happen

683
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
Denial of my feelings

684
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
There been many times

685
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
Through life experience where I have perceived

686
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
If I truly

687
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
Felt everything that there is in there

688
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
I would die

689
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
And I also

690
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
I also have to release

691
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
People

692
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
To their own process

693
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
And I cannot

694
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,872
Take responsibility for their process

695
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
I can't

696
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
All I can do is acknowledge

697
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
And release the rest

698
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
Jonathan told me something that

699
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Kutztown defensive

700
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,448
Actually I think is a truth that needs to be acknowledged

701
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
The idea that he

702
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,616
Was selling it love an action or perhaps that he bought into

703
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Ultimately goes Way Beyond him

704
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,296
The sources of all that shame are as much the families

705
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Of those kids

706
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Peer groups

707
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,904
The schools were they went to this early the churches

708
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,256
The society at large that creates the conditions for love and action to exist

709
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
He says he cannot take responsibility for all that

710
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
I think that's right

711
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
This

712
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,800
Is an album that

713
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,640
The guys in the program actually made for me

714
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
And it has pictures

715
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
With statements from

716
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Each one of those clients

717
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:17,696
Why we were there John showed us a kind of yearbook of the love and action class of 1993

718
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,280
These are these are students are wow

719
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,936
First picture was a kid who's maybe 18 husky thick black hair

720
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,288
This guy here you know you've been an inspiration to me from the first year I met you

721
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
I learned from you that you have to face life and death and then go through it

722
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,248
You're a good leader and a shepherd and I'm so grateful to the Lord for you I love you

723
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
And this is a guy

724
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
That today

725
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
He's married to his husband

726
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
Anna and we are in contact

727
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Regularly and

728
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,512
As a very affirming and positive relationship

729
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
This man I was in contact with

730
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:04,288
Call thin blonde hair but this is one of the one of the circumstances were this meant

731
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
He died of a drug overdose

732
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,384
About 2 years ago

733
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
They didn't believe it was suicide

734
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
But

735
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
He

736
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
He's no longer with us

737
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
Just see

738
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:23,744
Here's one for this guy he says Smitty they called me Smitty that can

739
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
So much of my heart has gone into preparing this Keepsake for you each time you look upon it may you know my love for you

740
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,728
He looks like early twenties tall thin Adam's apple

741
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,104
Can bushy black hair big smile

742
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,736
He doesn't completely accept necessarily where I am today

743
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,600
But he's very warm and friendly he doesn't accept where you were

744
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,648
He doesn't completely embrace

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Someone being gay and being married so he's not openly gay or is he talks about being gay but he

746
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
He's married

747
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Till woman

748
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
And he has a family

749
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,544
I've not had communication with him

750
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
I have had communication with him

751
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,224
American guy Freckles but he actually continued

752
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
Working for a very anti-gay organization

753
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
And

754
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
It got to the point where

755
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
I just was

756
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Was just in turmoil when I would see things you would post on Facebook or things you would say and so I really chose to

757
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
The kind of not be

758
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Affected by that

759
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,472
This is a guy

760
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,824
Sandy are radiant smile he was a guy that was HIV positive

761
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
When it came in the program and

762
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
3 years later he died

763
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
In California there were

764
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
People that were in our program or in our support group Ministry in California the years I was there 22

765
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
Two of those people died from HIV

766
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
Are you in touch with all these people

767
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,192
I have had communication with

768
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Him yes

769
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Him yes

770
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Yes

771
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,408
In the last five years since he's been high and drive love and action John says he has made it

772
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
His mission

773
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,504
To reach out to everyone he can to try and engage with them

774
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
Sport them if they want to be supported

775
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,856
If that's what they want

776
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
For him

777
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
His sort of

778
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Clean break

779
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
Really began in 2005

780
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
June 6th

781
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
2005

782
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,400
We moved in and that was our first day

783
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,728
They just upgraded their headquarters a second time hired more staff

784
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
Do we had just started a new group of

785
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Teenagers

786
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
Everybody was there we were excited

787
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
8:30 in the morning

788
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
Our office manager came running in my office and said John there are protesters outside

789
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
I was horrified

790
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
Horrified oh my gosh

791
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
What has happened how did they know this is when the torpedo struck young kid

792
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Kid in the program named Zach

793
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
I posted a message to Myspace saying his parents had put him in this straight Camp it was like a boot camp

794
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Wooden trees going to make it news camera started showing up

795
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Three of them

796
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,472
And all the sudden I heard John smid ween

797
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
You know you're in there John smid we know you're here

798
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:58,271
Connections new recovery Treatment Center in Raleigh over there in the morning and the night

799
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,695
From the protest I started entering into an absolute days just just a cloud

800
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:12,095
I I I don't even know the protest lasted for eight solid weeks International media started

801
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:18,495
Coming in there's so much attention that the state of Tennessee actually started cracking down performing in space

802
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,895
Directions John Schmitt ends of counter suing the state I was so desperate to make this work and he says now looking back with the maze

803
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,455
How long it took him to wake up how

804
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,855
All throughout his mind with contorted self to push away doubt I'd I would drive through the protesters

805
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
And I remember them saying we love you we love you to meet he says amazingly he interpreter

806
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,863
Did that in that moment as God speaking to him I know you're here and I knew you were here

807
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
And I didn't want you to hide

808
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,959
I wanted to celebrate you being here

809
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
And I did it through these protesters

810
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,591
That's the way I interpreted it has some mental gymnastics

811
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Yes

812
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
It is

813
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
The honest truth is what brought John into the light

814
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
What needed to happen before he

815
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
BLC light

816
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Is it his organization collapse

817
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,231
Protesters created division in a staff one of his managers tried to

818
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
Force Mount you didn't know what to do eventually

819
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
He resigns

820
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
And so when I resigned

821
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
I sat in my

822
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Newly designed home office

823
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
And I said God

824
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
I have no idea what you have in store for me for the

825
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Surprise me

826
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
From that point forward

827
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
He says it was like

828
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,783
Slowly sobering up after you've been drunk for 25 years

829
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
This time it wasn't a violent shift

830
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Is the series of

831
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Tiny micros

832
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
Like one day he's sitting in his computer and decides

833
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
Click on gay p***

834
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
For the first time in his life

835
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:52,191
Immediately feel horrible react with shame decides got to go tell his wife who he was still married to at the time by the way

836
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
But anything's

837
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
No

838
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
Not going to tell her

839
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,055
A short while after that

840
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
Is it a Christian Conference

841
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Any announces

842
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
To the audience that he John Smith the Elvis of the ex-gay movement

843
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
Was in fact not cured

844
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
Vocally said I'm a gay man

845
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
I'm a gay man

846
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
And

847
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
I'm in a mixed-orientation marriage

848
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,511
Mixed-orientation by the way means a marriage between a homosexual and heterosexual

849
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
I told term you sometimes here in this world

850
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,399
But that process that slow gradual Awakening

851
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,495
John says it is still happening yes the whole creative

852
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
In the car he told us even about the shoes he was wearing it so that brought it up I have bright blue tennis shoes on today

853
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
I bought those a month ago

854
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:42,367
I love bright colors I've always loved bright colors I stood in the store for 20 minutes

855
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,951
Looking at gray or turquoise blue shoes are identical

856
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
And I made the decision the conscious decision and I feel very emotional about this crazy

857
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:59,007
Table tennis shoes but I had to make the decision to buy the blue tennis shoes because I love turquoise

858
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
Blue and it's that it's it's still, I'm still coming out I'm still having to open my

859
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Self up

860
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,991
To the reality

861
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,599
Of who I am and who I was wired to be from the moment I was born

862
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
It just there's his constant battle within me to deny to push away to surgically cut

863
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:26,399
A major component of who I am and so even though I was a I was an ex-gay leader

864
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,263
And one of the one of the instruments of abuse

865
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,151
I'm also a person it was subjected to ex-gay Ministry for 25 years

866
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
And so I have the same kinds of anger in the same kinds of wounds the same kind of pain

867
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
And that complicated this about John Smith

868
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
He is both the instrument of abuse

869
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
And also

870
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:54,047
A subject himself of that same abuse it might color how you see the Final Chapter

871
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
In his journey

872
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
From

00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,911
Straight to gay 2x k2xx gay

875
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
8 miles west

876
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Avisca

877

Community call Maxi Tech

878
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
Is Larry McQueen John's husband

879
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,575
He works in the engineering department of a company that manufactures pipes for oil rigs third-generation Pentecostal

880
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,719
Come to a very religious family and so before he and John to Connected about 5 years ago

881
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
He had never been with a man

882
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:31,167
He tried dating women it didn't work knew he was attracted to men push those thoughts away up to that point I had lived

883
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
My life alone

884
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
And

885
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,823
In fact I had come to the point where I was crying myself

886
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Because I was so lonely

887
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,759
And that's what I actually led me to say look Larry you know

888
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,343
You're 40 something years old you're lonely

889
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
I don't think God really wants me to be this way

890
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:59,583
The first night they were together which initially wasn't romantic it was they've gotten together as friends to do some Home Improvement projects

891
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
Talk about this on the radio

892
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
For now I fight

893
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,079
What okay so so I walked we went out to dinner came back and we just

894
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
We just really had a

895
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Comfortable time

896
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
And Larry

897
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
Came to an amazing awareness at that point

898
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
He said you know

899
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
What I'm feeling with you

900
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
Really confirms to me that I'm gay

901
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,535
Any sitting by the way we're sleeping in separate beds

902
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,351
Next morning Larry walks into John's room

903
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Lays down beside me on the bed

904
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,543
Puts his arm around and he just put his arms around me and I was reading an email he had his arms around me and I

905
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Just started to sob uncontrollably

906
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,687
You know I had never in my life ever cried with another human being

907
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
It for me

908
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,807
It was like almost a physical sensation inside me

909
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
That

910
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
As if there were cogs

911
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,463
That never were quite aligned proper

912
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
But that weekend I felt

913
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
Within my body

914
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,655
These cogs coming into place and click

915
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
And I felt whole for the first

916
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
I was Larry's first kiss

917
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Wow

918
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
52 years old

919
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
A few months after that weekend John got a divorce from his second wife Bolin

920
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,047
John Larry got married in 2014 and these days they sing in their church choir

921
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,607
Is the only openly gay couple in their Church

922
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
And they continue to nudge to church

923
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
Urgently

924
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
To take a stand

925
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
Support of gay marriage

926
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,335
The end of the day it's still difficult to know how to reconcile John Smith's past with his present

927
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,919
Whether he's taken enough responsibility for his actions or not

928
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,479
We spoke to people who are all over the map on that question

929
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
John would say

930
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
How do you feel

931
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
The lesson from his life is that

932
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,439
Recently people can change humans are teachable

933
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
Human mind is infinite

934
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895
Robert I wanted to offer once I know to the story

935
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
In the time

936
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,783
That we were working on this series like something like four states

937
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,183
I mean that number wrong outlawed conversion therapy for minors and if you looked us or more broadly in the last

938
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Few years

939
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:40,863
There's been this wave of legislation is trying to stamp this out yeah on what theory

940
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,959
That's cool I mean that special your talk about offering to minors

941
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
So I think

942
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,895
Something like 37 municipalities in the last few years have have outlawed conversion therapy for minors

943
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
And at the same time you have a lot of debate about the sort of expanding idea of religious freedom

944
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Back protection that's written into the First Amendment

945
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,695
And a lot of these groups are arguing successfully * that

946
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
They have the Conn

947
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
Institutional right

948
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
To offer these broke

949
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:16,191
It's a really interesting and confusing moment right now

950
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,223
This episode of Radiolab was drawn from unerased

951
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:33,855
The Untold History of conversion therapy in America a series that I worked on with Focus Features

952
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,439
Stitcher and luminas in conjunction with a feature film boy erased

953
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:44,095
Huge thanks to the production team Shamaley Ikat Aaron Alice Quinlan Michael assessor David Craig Garrard Conley

954
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:48,959
To Anonymous content for their support of unerased if you want to hear the entire series I hope you will

955
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
You can find on race in all the usual podcast

956
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Okay well I guess we should go

957
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,175
Yes that's what we can buy
