1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab today we're going to start off with a building

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Not just any building but a building that is

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Heavy

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
With secret

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah it's building we first really learned about got a picture of

9
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
From the Seoul

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
Katie Engelhart I'm a reporter of Vice news in London

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240

Obsessed

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Devastatingly obsessed

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
With this place called hanslope Park

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
Central Park is this

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Huge

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,760
Sprawling complex in buckinghamshire near us

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Hong Kong Milton Keynes

20
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Which

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,648
Isn't too far from London and I'm pretty sure Jamie York

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,512
Happened to be in London on vacation so we asked him we'll watch describe your tape recorder

23
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Go down there

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Check it out

25
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
It's a bit of a drive from London

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
About an hour and a half on the M1

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
And do you approach this

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
Assertive beautiful

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
Town with adorable little

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
Posh Cottages in

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
Little Pub

32
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Not from around here I'm looking for Antelope Park

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,784
I mean it's your sort of typical you old a British

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Village

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
Security lights

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,488
Metaphor minute drive past that you'll the town you go to

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Fieldcrest Overhill and there it is

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
This massive massive building surrounded by razor

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
To the archives

40
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Are held in a purpose-built building from the 90s archives by the way from the largest Empire

41
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Evernote

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
It's like if you were creating a movie set

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
For like

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Secretive government compound where they

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Keep secret files

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
You would literally just make this

47
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Jamie Parker

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Quarter mile away

49
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Walk up to the gate

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Big

51
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Electrified

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Through the gate

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Pasties traffic spikes

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Just as he barely stepped inside

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Are you going to call

56
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Call

57
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Activity

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,992
I got grabbed them taken to a guard house

59
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
It's a microphone

60
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
And then

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
They walk him

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Are you going to escort me all the way back to my car

63
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
The entire quarter-mile back to his car

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Now we've heard it said that the files in that building if they were ever released could we write to

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
200 years of history no idea if that's true we just don't know

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
The one story that has so far away

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
The refined kind of startling

68
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
We shall see that there's some stuff coming up days

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Graphic and disturbing

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
So if you're listening with kids

71
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
You might want to see

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Although if you're not listening with kids don't skip it

73
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Okay

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Asturias of Kenya

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
Kenya was always that scene is historian David Anderson and it kind of sepia-tinted hey

76
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
Many years ago can wife end of Adventure

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Who found the country beautiful

78
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
The climate kind of soil for tile

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,216
Bougainvillea Sunshine smiling happy seven

80
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
David says in the 1910s 20s 30s the British public

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Was obsessed with Ken yet books eventually television programs was one of the crown jewels of the Empire and so yeah

82
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
You had all of these Brits

83
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
Leaving Britain and going to Kenya

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,112
Start a new life and many many more settlers who floated to Kenya

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Lower middle classes

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
You could have a much better salary

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
And a much better living standard in Kenya than they ever could back at home

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
They stayed in founded the young colony

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Women make their homes

90
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
Whether children are born taught them grow strong and healthy

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Now it probably goes without saying this new life for the British citizen came at the expense of the Kenyan I was already living

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,807
Two problems that were always encountered in Africa and in general is colonization is the issue of land in the issue of Labor

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
That's Harvard historian Caroline Elkins play a big role in our story

94
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
Joan Kennedy Champlin Problem by simply alienating it and giving it to the white farmers

95
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
But that becomes a labor problem how do you force

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Africans

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Till Labor cheaply

98
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
On plantations

99
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
Write like in this case of tea and coffee

100
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
Love the way you do it is you create what I call native Reserves

101
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
We had them here for for Native American

102
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
Tracy says that the native Kenyans were forced off their land into slums where they could barely eke out a living and so the only off

103
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
They had

104
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
What's the word for the white people

105
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
And that's how it went for four decades

106
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Until

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
The Second World War

108
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Ask the question has started 1939 suddenly.

109
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
Thousands of men Canyon Manor forced into war

110
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Came in contact with ideas of Independence and they anticipated when they return

111
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
Turn the day is Big Bear in Europe day after that

112
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,559
They would have access to land that the conditions will be getting better but

113
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Nope

114
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
They may find their condition is not only

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Not gotten better it's gotten worse

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
And so after the war a few of these vets

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
From the largest ethnic group in Kenya

118
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Call the kikuyu

119
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
They get together

120
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
And they decide to take an oath

121
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
No Odin is traditional amongst

122
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
The kikuyu

123
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
So for example men

124
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,279
A hundred years ago or more would take an oath pledging allegiance to their ethnic group as they went to war with somebody else

125
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
This case they take an oath

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,655
Pledging themselves to kick all Europeans out of the colony

127
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Then the earthquake today that I pledge to take all Europeans out of the colony out of Kenya and if I don't met this earth kill me

128
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,431
I pledged to take up arms against the Europeans if I don't buy this house kill me

129
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,039
No question last thing that was said always was if I reveal the contents of this Earth

130
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
May the South killed

131
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
She said the first thing they did

132
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Was attack the settlers livestock

133
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,119
Doing things like hamstring cattle hamstringing cattle

134
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
2

135
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
They started destroying property duro's started to involve things like eyeballs Ram scrotums intestine

136
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,943
Blood things that absolutely repulse the local European settlers and put Terror into them

137
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
Why do they end up calling themselves the mammal that is much debated

138
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
But nobody quite agreeing on on how it

139
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
How it came to pass but the mailman hours

140
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Many tickets

141
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Swahili derivative of sort of more more that they would there be no some say it has to do with you peeing

142
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
And I don't play this

143
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
Overhearing what was the malos

144
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,871
Whatever the case in 1952 the colonial government

145
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Is there the British Army in Kenya

146
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Declares state of emergency

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
And those pajama agents timeout

148
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
They asked why they start going after the loyalists

149
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
The Chinese have been helping settlers

150
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Destination after the next

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
In the British terrified this is the night of the Long Knives

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
Flights coming into reality and it's only about to get worse

153
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
And that happens on the night of January 24th

154
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
1953 which was the murder of the rock family

155
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
The Rocks were these very young lovely couple

156
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
Rothrock was a farmer as Miraak with a doctor

157
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
Flaxseed minister to the local population

158
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
And they had a little boy named Michael

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Who is six

160
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Just not date a little boy that falling off

161
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Is Tony and his

162
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
One of their trusted servants

163
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Querida backup

164
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
The house

165
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Later that night a group of Mal Mal crept out of the forest

166
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Lord Rodger Desmond rock out of the house

167
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Kill them

168
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,455
And then the whole gang including that same servant that helped the boy

169
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
A March into the house go up to the little boy's room

170
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
And they hacked him to death

171
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
And there's a

172
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Very famous

173
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Photo of the young boy dead

174
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Absolutely buddy

175
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
Which is in every major newspaper

176
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
And almost overnight

177
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Mal Mal become synonymous

178
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
With pure evil

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,471
And our mind in children's vine Mom hour

180
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Bigger than life

181
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Darkest dark people

182
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
That you ever saw

183
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
An excess of reporting this story one of our producers lot of Nasser told us

184
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
About how his mom

185
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
Grew up next door to Kenya in

186
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
What is now called Tanzania

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
And to her and her friends

188
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
The Mal Mal were like a monster to children

189
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
The Boogeyman

190
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
That was sort of a

191
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,679
All the time. My mother especially prefer to if

192
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
If you don't drink your milk or if you don't sleep

193
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
Mama Wichita

194
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
I like the mama will come and get you

195
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
And how scared were you

196
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
You know what

197
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Just the word Momo

198
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
Would make us run troll under the bed

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
I'm old enough

200
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
To be one of the people who thought

201
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
There were

202
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,303
Yes Theory like weird

203
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Self-organizing terrorist

204
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:18,495
Yes the most Beast you a horrible awful Savage movement that I had ever hit the face the British Empire

205
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
Okay so here's our we get to the part of the story that is in deep

206
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Flux after the

207
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Murder of the rock family

208
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
The settlers demanded

209
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
That the colonial government do something

210
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
And they did they pursued the male Fighters

211
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Supposedly

212
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Small band of Fighters into the forest

213
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
There were skirmishes

214
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
The last

215
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,487
Four years Story Goes the Mal Mal movement never quite gained

216
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Traction

217
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
And ultimately the British quell the Rebellion they handled it

218
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Now that's for how they handle

219
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
For the longest time

220
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
People would look back it was this

221
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Giant

222
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Blank Spot

223
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
No one quite knew what

224
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Happened

225
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
And here's why

226
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Cody David Anderson

227
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
By the time the British finally decide to leave

228
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
1963

229
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,807
By that time Kenya is around the 20th

230
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Different Colony that Britain will leave

231
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
So it's about halfway down the list

232
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
So there's already in place

233
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
A protest

234
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,399
At the stadium the articles of Independence

235
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
The formal stage of powers they set off fireworks and then

236
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
The Ritz roll out of the woods daytrana smooth

237
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
And colorful and happy

238
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Exit

239
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:38,879
And at some point in that well-worn exit process either right before the exit right afterwards there was

240
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
David calls it the weeding of document

241
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
I mean the British government

242
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Conducted

243
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,167
Very very sophisticated Purge operations and all of its former colonies

244
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
Katie Engelhart again she says it everywhere you look Uganda Palestine Rhodesia Zanzibar Nigeria Jordan Malaya Hong Kong

245
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Their stories of

246
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Paper is being

247
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Kind of tightly packed into boxes and drops it

248
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,783
See a lot of papers were burned as a joke

249
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
In Hmong engine historians

250
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
On the day that India treat its independence

251
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
When the celebrations were taking place in Delhi

252
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
You could hardly see what's going on on the podium

253
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
Does the wattage of smok playing across from the bone fires are burning.

254
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,703
All of which is to say that it was snow soon for 30 years that that Blank Spot

255
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,311
Aphmau emergency with just a blank in the story of the evil now or just continue

256
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Because there were no documents to say otherwise

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Then

258
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
We get to Caroline Elkins

259
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,271
How did you like a Once Upon a Time you are a curious

260
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Young

261
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Grad student or something

262
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
We'd have to go back further you know I'm dating myself at age 45 but the I have to go back to my aunt

263
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Undergraduate years

264
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Chucky 1990

265
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
I was at Princeton and when we work me that you do senior thesis there in Princeton was ahead of its time and

266
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
I got lots of funding and I went off to London and in Kenya

267
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
How old are you when you're taking a ship

268
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
20

269
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
So Carolina is working in Nairobi

270
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:09,503
And I'm doing research at the time I seen your pieces was looking at the kikuyu which is the largest ethnic group in Kenya

271
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
And

272
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,671
I was looking primarily at the shifting roles of women and in the ways in which they were impacted by Kanye West

273
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
So Carolina would wake up every morning and would walk

274
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,863
To this Old Colonial building right in Nairobi City Center call the National Archives

275
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Louder

276
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
Dusty it's

277
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
You know sometimes you have to jump under the desk for several hours cuz there's a shootout at

278
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Cross the street

279
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Really

280
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,687
Yeah that was quite a Saturday

281
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
Long story short so one day she was at The Archives flipping through some files when I came across some fire

282
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
On

283
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Detention camp

284
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Kamichi detection kit

285
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Committee

286
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,655
Kam adamary ITI

287
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
I just outside Nairobi

288
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
And

289
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
I said gosh you know

290
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
I know nothing about this

291
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Sochi

292
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Calls over the archives

293
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
Guy named Evenson

294
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
You said yeah let me take a look and then bring me some other files also related to akimichi

295
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
Bureaucratic files these Pages were filled with the with details and numbers of prisoners a lot of them

296
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,839
Were women well over a thousand because I would mention a hundred of this and

297
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Honor to that

298
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
And at that point I saw it

299
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
What's going on

300
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,591
So short time later she gets back to Princeton and being the Goodwill undergraduate history major that I was I

301
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
I searched high and low about detention camps in Kenya

302
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Nothing much ya no mention of

303
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
The center

304
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
There's nobody who done the systematic study of

305
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
And

306
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
That's what I was at

307
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,535
So without anything else to go on Caroline just started driving up country

308
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
The middle of nowhere Kenya

309
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
All these tiny little villages

310
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
It's in the central Province if you wanted to find middle of nowhere on the map I was in it I would just show up at somebody's little Sean Barr Farm one day

311
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Garlic bread

312
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
Affordable Dental Care

313
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,991
Next thing you know I'm conducting an interview while working. How many

314
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
These are tapes recorded on a few of her trips she would speak to people through her research assistant Terry wairimu

315
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
1 4 hours then one interview be guess the next every time you finish an interview you say you don't you have somebody else who I could talk to her

316
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,959
Matteo yeah I've got my friend list three Bridges up in Four Hills over

317
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Text you talk to that person

318
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
And then person they refer to

319
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
In person they refer to

320
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
This is what you did for like 5 years I want interviewed several hundred.

321
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
And what exactly are they telling you

322
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Stories

323
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
If you can imagine

324
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
But the stories were

325
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
What does Dory have began to unravel

326
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
This is Darlene calling from Kampala Uganda

327
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,079
Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation

328
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
And by the Alfred

329
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383

Technology in the modern world

332
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
More information about Sloan

333
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Www.

334
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
. org

335
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,975
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

336
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,095
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

337
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teacher

338
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments childhood brilliance

339
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
Did something

340
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,063
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

341
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,183
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

342
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,839
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

343
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

344
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
We're interested in the

345
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Epic moments where

346
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,895
A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

347
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
If you have a story please share it with us

348
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

349
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Record a short audio message

350
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

351
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Thank you so much

352
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Hey I'm Jared I'm run I'm rubber

353
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,151
Krobus Radiolab before we get to the stories that Caroline was referring to

354
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
We should say that as we were

355
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,015
Reporting the story we really kind of fell in deep

356
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
To the point where Jamie York

357
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,671
Put Oregon to London to get hassled by those guards at Hansel Park

358
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
He then decided to spend part of his vacation

359
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
In Kenya

360
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
Basically following in Caroline Elkins footsteps

361
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Yes

362
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
And that's when he stumbled into something kind of surprising

363
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
So I got picked up early one morning in Nairobi

364
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,359
And driven about three hours into the countryside

365
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,919
And okay after what felt like

366
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
5 right turns 37 last we finally wind up in this completely replace it really

367
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Just feel like the middle of nowhere

368
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,767
It's like a little village or something little cluster of houses in Rolling Hills in a county called me area

369
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
Got my stuff out of the car

370
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Solitary

371
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,679
Yeah it arranged the trip

372
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
I am 41 years old

373
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
Same Terry who translated for Carolyn Elkins many years

374
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,407
Anyhow Crestview kids

375
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
And

376
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
Terry walks me to this little clay hut

377
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,879
There's a table in the center of the room there's a handful plastic chairs around it and eventually

378
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
People start showing up

379
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Women

380
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Hey

381
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
9 women

382
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Who are all in their late eighties early nineties

383
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Introductions

384
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
Honestly I'm a little bit disappointed because timeout

385
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
I thought

386
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Wechat

387
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Men

388
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Spiders

389
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
I think these women I thought

390
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
Most of the men have died of old age so you thought you were going to meet anybody

391
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Exactly

392
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Curious

393
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
For myself

394
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
But I thought okay I'll

395
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
I just asked

396
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
How many of you identified is Malmo

397
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Activity about to get with you

398
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Instantaneously room put their hand up

399
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
All my people

400
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Yeah

401
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
And then started to sort of chuckle

402
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,551
Because it's obvious you are supporting mom

403
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,135
They were like of course we were supporting the mama we were the mama

404
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Like that

405
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
That was everybody

406
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
So interesting so it wasn't just like a small band of militants

407
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,072
It wasn't a small band of militants amongst the kikuyu it was

408
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Almost everyone

409
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,752
This is one of the first things that caught Caroline Elkins attention made her really question that official narrative

410
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Cuz when she was doing interviews 15 years ago

411
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,384
She said everyone she spoke to everyone

412
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
To a person

413
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
And we're talking hundreds of interviews

414
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Started with I took the oath

415
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
On such and such a date

416
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Very interesting

417
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
Seemed to her what you had here was not

418
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
A small Insurrection this was a mass move

419
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
And she would discover the British response to it

420
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Was also massive

421
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
1953

422
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,424
Shortly after the murder of the Rock Family the white settlers marched

423
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Demand that the colonial government do something

424
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,080
Until what happened

425
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,456
Speak into the village Bazaar going to Villages across Kenya they rounded everybody up know each other

426
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
Slaughter cattle slaughter their goats burned down their Homestead

427
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
And put them into these

428
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Prison Village

429
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,928
800 barbed wire Villages throughout

430
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Central Province Kenya

431
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,168
The Village was like a concentration camp

432
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
The thing the thing to grasp. This is very carefully designed

433
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
I'm very

434
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Practical

435
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,128
David said there was a very carefully planned system

436
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,712
Work the barbed wire Villages were primarily for women and children

437
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Men were usually sent to these detention camps are true based

438
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Prison

439
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
The logic of those camps

440
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
Was actually thought up by a group of British academics

441
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
Who met in 1953

442
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,096
Turn emergency meeting to discuss the quote mouth problem and they decided at that meeting

443
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Clearly

444
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,448
The real reason the Mau Mau Rebellion was it that way

445
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,008
Captured by some kind of mental illness

446
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:13,408
Had nothing to do with the fact their land has been taken away from them know it was said they were temporarily crazy and the committee decided at

447
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Must have something to do

448
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
With those

449
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,552
Host Machine by the British as a primitive way

450
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
Capturing a kikuyu mine

451
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
I'm making the person unreasonable and insensitive

452
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
The only way they all could you get rid of the oath

453
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Was to convert the person back to sanity

454
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
Part of that involved a confession of what

455
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
I done

456
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
Once confessions were made

457
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
It would then be rewarded

458
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Buy a better prison regime

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Baby movement around the compound

460
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Given privileges

461
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Given better food

462
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,760
You moved along the system too cold for pipeline you would along the pipeline Until You released

463
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
But you first have to confess

464
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
To confess

465
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
To confess

466
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
This is get to walk hungari

467
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Freedom fighter

468
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,560
I joined to the MoMA Freedom struggle

469
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
When I was 17 years of age

470
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Quickly became an organizer

471
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Recruiter

472
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
And therefore Target

473
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
They had to

474
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Search for men

475
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
And they caught me

476
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
They put me into a detention camp

477
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
They want us to say loudly

478
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
And that wish for 6

479
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,416
The Momo struggle

480
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Littlefield

481
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
Attack one man tell the story of how in one of the barbwire villages

482
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
Mo McRae

483
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,728
Every once in awhile would come to the edge of the forest

484
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Just outside the villages fence

485
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
These were the fighters

486
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Hadn't been captured yet they'd come right

487
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
The edge of the camp

488
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Where a lot of the children

489
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Would be fine

490
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
And go there

491
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
No grown-ups that states you don't understand anything about what was happening that country

492
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,928
The people in the village used to use the children

493
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
To take messages to the people in the for the fighters in the forest

494
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Better day pass

495
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,632
Food and information to the fighters in a way kept things going

496
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
The point is Zachary David the inside the camps

497
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Massive Resistance

498
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
It so many cases the British colonial soldiers

499
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
With double down

500
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
Warning the following is

501
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Pretty graphic

502
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Does BBC documentary called White

503
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
It has

504
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
Tons of these frightening Lee comments

505
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Stories of abuse

506
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
From detainees

507
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
He told me I'm naked

508
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Tidebuy speak to The Buzz

509
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,024
He was brutally beaten on the testicles with a stick

510
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
One of them is a man giving a tour of the

511
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
The prison cell he was kept in

512
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,936
Then they said his eyes with hot coals

513
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
They kept him that the 8 days

514
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
This another story of the Three Men Who were made

515
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
To strip naked

516
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,432
What element was made to put his head into a bucket of water

517
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
With a woman

518
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,600
Men the white officer held one of the prisoners legs a lot

519
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
Yamuna show

520
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
And another God brought some sand

521
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,328
Steak

522
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,264
Alternative putting in sand and water

523
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Will the wild pushing the mixture in with a stick

524
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
FedEx still gives me nightmares to this day

525
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,808
Because that was something that should never be done to a human being with

526
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
And that.

527
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Of course if violence

528
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
It lasted throughout the 1950s

529
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm on my way back.

530
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Listen there's nothing to excuse this kind of terrorism thought the kenning campaign was a sledgehammer

531
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
Hammer used to crack a note

532
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,200
There been a lot of different estimates to try to pin down the scale

533
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Of the British campaign

534
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
They range from 160

535
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,856
Thousand people killed named torture detain

536
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,208
Too much much higher numbers Carolina consider own calculation

537
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
And according to her all the time it was done nearly the entire kikuyu population of a million

538
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
1/2 people

539
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Retained

540
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Tortured

541
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Murdered

542
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
Systematized Force

543
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Labor

544
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,336
And you have to look at scale

545
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,896
And if you are the balance sheet of this

546
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
How many Europeans died

547
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
32

548
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
32

549
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,600
Like why isn't this until everybody in the world now

550
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
In the event say of

551
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
The enslavement of the Hebrew people under the pharaoh

552
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
They were slaves in Egypt

553
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
The Pharaoh wouldn't let

554
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Timeout

555
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
It becomes

556
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
The national story

557
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Of the Hebrew people

558
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
In this situation

559
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
You have done working out of I believe is it

560
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Kikuyu becoming the first

561
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Why wouldn't I

562
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
He make this the national story

563
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
Well Kenyatta comes out of detention

564
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
And one of the first things he does

565
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Is he denounces malmo

566
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
The same organization that accelerated Independence

567
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,488
She says the same movement scare the British

568
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Scared him

569
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
He didn't want them suddenly organizing and taking his

570
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
Soap for

571
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Decades

572
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,008
From 1948 until 2002 the ban on Mal Mal that have been put in place

573
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
By the British colonial government remained in place

574
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
Meaning it was illegal to even talk about it

575
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
But eventually in 2005 Caroline publishes her book

576
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
Imperial Reckoning concluded the hundreds of interviews

577
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
Picture of Justice systemic violence

578
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
The book was well-received which says

579
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
A lot of critics told her

580
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Nice story

581
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
But

582
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Now

583
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
This is an active fiction

584
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Actor fiction

585
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
I made it up

586
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
But you had all these interviews

587
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
But one of them lines

588
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
Was that is all based upon oral test

589
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
Oral testimonies are usable

590
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
There is no story here

591
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
She said love that was

592
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,600
Blatant racism you know Africans makeup

593
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Stories

594
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
But buried in there

595
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,304
Is sort of legitimate concern of memory is faulty we know that oral histories are notoriously unreliable

596
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
If you're going to rewrite entire history

597
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
You need to get Beyond personal anecdote

598
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
You need documents

599
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Tequila straight improve-it Beyond.

600
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,896
As you mentioned that you found the documents

601
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Didn't seem to exist

602
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Nonetheless

603
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,064
Fast forward 2009

604
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,696
Caroline's Imperial Reckoning became the basis of a very large lawsuit

605
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,560
In June of 2009 5ml veterans representing over 5,000 Mouse

606
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,656
Flew to London

607
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
And filed a lawsuit against the British government the first time the British government had ever been sued by a former colonized population

608
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
Veterans want an apology

609
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
Some form of recompense for what happened are you at all nervous going into the court

610
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
I was not at all convinced that we're going to go anywhere but down that smart day he represented amount veterans in court

611
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,048
And the reason he was so sure that the case was going to go down in flames

612
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Most same issue

613
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
You just didn't have the documents

614
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
All we had were stories

615
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
When exactly Rock Solid

616
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
Yeah that it was a nightmare

617
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,104
Old canyons in the late 70s 80s

618
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,688
Africans in my experience Van Dyke's extremely difficult

619
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
The people in that seventies night she's almost

620
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:50,112
And this is actually a huge problem because in the British system if you're going to bring forward an old

621
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Old case

622
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
Like one that's more than 6 years old the key question to the judge is can you still get a fair trial the government

623
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
I can plausibly argue no

624
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Too much time has passed

625
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,448
We really worried that the judge would say well look that count be a fair trial because

626
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Actually these

627
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
Witness is a cell wall

628
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
So up and down just in Tim's that memory

629
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,128
It really that evidence is worth it right now

630
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
So to recap I wasn't really optimistic

631
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
But then

632
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
It's kind of a last-ditch effort

633
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
He contacted historian David Anderson

634
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
Tonight tonight to witness

635
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,952
Because David has written a book about African history that was chock-full of legal documents

636
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
And they approached me to ask

637
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Whether that was material in the legal cases are dealt

638
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
That might

639
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
Be useful to

640
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
And that's what he told him something that

641
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
What ultimately lead

642
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
All of us back that scary building a secret he told them

643
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
For the past 20 years

644
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
He has had this hunch

645
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
Well so long before the my my

646
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Trial came to court

647
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
I and my brother story ends

648
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Believed

649
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,112
The documents being brought back from Kenya to Britain

650
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
David said in that same Nairobi archive where Caroline Elkins found the talking about the tension

651
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Gosh you know what's going on in that same place somebody else who found another document that it also

652
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
This one is a simple packing slip listing of documents for transportation packing up and removed

653
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
Now it's for where those documents were moved to well

654
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
The ocean from 1997-98 99 like starving man with a single Pringle David kept.

655
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:32,512
I eventually bought documents from the national archives in Britain that confirmed the stuff from Kenya actually landed an error

656
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Airport in Britain Independence

657
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:40,192
And then was able to find out who took them with Van they went in the car's registration number

658
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Thought

659
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
That's in the trail went cold

660
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,848
Defile document request after document request that we get nowhere

661
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Then

662
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
Something totally unexpected app

663
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
Do historians working on Southern Africa actually got access to Hounslow

664
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
They got inside

665
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
One of them was the former Colonial administrators Zoe

666
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Networks and connections to get its way in any out

667
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
After work

668
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
He sent David Anderson a text message

669
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,984
Telling me the enhancement parking scene

670
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
Miles and miles of shelving

671
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Of documents

672
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
From other colonies

673
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Including Kenya

674
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,736
Was that a figure of speech miles or was that I think you meant it literally

675
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,320
Heat seat scene of vas a hanger is he

676
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Describe it

677
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,392
With row upon row upon row of.

678
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,768
So when Martin de the lawyer contacted David Anderson and asked him can you help us with

679
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
Arcades David said

680
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Yes I can do

681
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,424
I can actually give you any documents cuz I don't have any but I can outline for youth

682
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
The documents that I think

683
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
Might be out

684
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
The documents I believe

685
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
The bass, Whiting way

686
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,944
So he wrote a witness report for the judge summarizing everything he knew giving all the details I had

687
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
I didn't mention Huntsville Park I didn't say what I thought they were

688
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
I just said I knew they coming to Britain

689
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,464
I want to know what happened to the judge read that report and then basically asked the government

690
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Do you have them or not look

691
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,048
If you can't answer this question

692
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
You'll be held in contempt of court

693
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,912
I will interpret this is you withheld information

694
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
I'm at basic means you lose the case

695
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
That decision was the turning point

696
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
Half a century on from Britain's withdrawal from Kenya documents detailing Yelich brutality employee

697
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
By the British colonial authorities

698
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Have finally been released

699
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
I'm suddenly having spent years denying these documents existed but in 4 days they found them

700
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,024
Canyons will wasting in Nairobi today for the news from London

701
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,400
You can see the reaction of these people here today

702
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
I mean we're talking

703
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
We're talking something like

704
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
300 boxes of files

705
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Tons of missing documents

706
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
15000 papers relevant to the case

707
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,200
This again is Katie Engelhart of Vice news she reported on the trial and the

708
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Tencent number of

709
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
House of the government

710
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,088
100 linear feet I think those those files held

711
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,928
And it contained really really damning

712
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:14,816
Evidence of Britain's conduct in Kenya government in London did no

713
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,144
What was happening in Kenya there was specific documentation

714
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
A rounding up with Mama Fighters

715
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
It was even a memo about a Kenyan being roasted alive feeding letter written by detainees at then smuggled

716
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Set up a cabinet

717
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:32,480
Hurry hurry hurry in order to save our souls I mean absolutely damning evidence

718
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
The government ultimately agreed to pay a bounty

719
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
20 million pound

720
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
List of people who brought this lawsuit

721
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
Which works out to roughly $4,600

722
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Yes

723
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
He said I understand

724
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Why would they even save those

725
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Well

726
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,888
Looking through the collections of no emerged

727
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
It's quite clear to me

728
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
That

729
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
They want

730
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
Get to save documents that showed

731
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,384
Not all European stuff in Kenya

732
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,944
Hyping happy about compulsive Force

733
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Who the letter written in 1953

734
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296
By the colonies Attorney General

735
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,880
He observes that detention facilities in Kenya or quote

736
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,488
Distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or communist Russia

737
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:20,864
So you think the people some of the British officers in Kenya save the files

738
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Precisely because they were damn

739
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Yes

740
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
They save stuff that would demonstrate

741
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
That we didn't like that

742
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
What are the reason why the memo case has become so much bigger than

743
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Just amount

744
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,832
As soon as journalists and historians learn about the existence of those files they started to relentlessly poke

745
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,976
And request more documents and soon those 1500 8800 files

746
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,792
I meant 20,000 files and then

747
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
1.2 million files

748
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,680
And at the time the estimate was at the files occupied

749
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
About 15 miles

750
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,264
Floor-to-ceiling shelving

751
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
15 MI

752
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,360
The process that is being invoked

753
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Biting my my case

754
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,992
Is going to have even wider repercussions than people yet

755
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Realize

756
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
We got a little

757
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
Infloo laugh

758
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
When we're talking with a woman named Mandy Banton

759
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,816
A senior research fellow at London University national archives in London

760
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
And we call Hertz to help

761
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
Parse all this stuff and it one point I asked her if it's just a Kenya thing

762
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
And she said oh no no no

763
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
It's not it's not by any means

764
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,336
Explain the after the mammoth case the

765
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,408
Foreign Commonwealth office which is the technical name for the place

766
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
Holding those document

767
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Almost immediately afterwards

768
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,368
It admitted that he actually had documents from 37 former

769
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Colonist

770
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
Yes exactly

771
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
You mean that there could be dirty stuff from Malaysia dirty stuff from Palestine dirty stuff from

772
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Cypresside Morgan Isaiah

773
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
Sofia Soto

774
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,288
Couple spots if you like I mean it's like a rewriting of history is that

775
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,408
I don't mean to run now Questlove to pay for

776
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,504
I'm looking at these you know comparatively newly-released records

777
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
Now both David and Katie

778
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,904
Cautioned us that the new stuff when it comes out might not be

779
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
White is revelatory as

780
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
All those Manuel files

781
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
I think their nuggets

782
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
I think their nuggets and I think

783
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
I mean I think historians will find them

784
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
For David Anderson one of those nuggets might be the documents about

785
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
The Cold War

786
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,568
Those could be historically really very very important

787
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,896
Fort Caroline Elkins israel-palestine that Malaysia

788
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
Singapore and I want to know what time does Hong Kong files there is over 250,000 documents on Hong Kong

789
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Just Hong Kong

790
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Which

791
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,416
Sort of brings us to the situation that we are in now

792
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:57,536
Just the most ridiculous ridiculous stupid situation imaginable

793
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,168
Which is that for the moment the British government's policy is that all documents must be reviewed

794
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Aerodactyl

795
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Did before release

796
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,080
So each file needs to be looked over by What's called the senior sensitivity review

797
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
Colloquially as weeders

798
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
Believe retired

799
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Senior diplomat

800
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
If you can imagine you've got

801
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:22,112
15 miles of papers and you've got literally a couple of dozen

802
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Tired

803
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:27,744
Diplomats I may sit in an office literally turning Pages trying to stay awake

804
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Sitting here just imagine

805
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
And redact

806
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
All day long

807
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Redact

808
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Redact

809
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
At the rate

810
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
That we're going

811
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,384
The time these files finally see the light of day it will not be within my lifetime

812
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,688
It could literally be hundreds of years

813
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
I keep thinking about this two groups of elderly folks

814
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
Again producer Jamie York

815
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
The litigants in the Mama Cass are in their 80s and 90s

816
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
It just strikes me that

817
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
What a crazy lucky break for them that

818
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
In

819
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
The very final years

820
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
They're alive

821
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Survived

822
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
To hear this apology

823
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
Numbers government acknowledgement

824
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Shred-it been telling

825
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
For 50 years

826
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Well

827
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
Thank you

828
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
Yeah thank you for putting it that way because I

829
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
I'm having

830
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,456
Got to know the plaintiff in the case

831
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
When they came to London

832
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,296
It was very clear to me that

833
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,624
What matter to these people Wars

834
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Note

835
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
A financial settlement

836
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
But rather

837
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Abnormal

838
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Just

839
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Simple of knowledge

840
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
That these things

841
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Abington

842
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
So

843
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Own the day

844
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
That the Barrister for the crime

845
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
Stand up in court I'm too old

846
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,152
Of our astonishment

847
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Chad quite simply

848
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
The British government admits

849
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Stitches

850
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,856
Once I gathered my Wix and looked right behind me in the cold

851
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
At 2

852
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
The plaintiff swearing tears

853
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
And

854
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
It brought home to me

855
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
What a traumatic

856
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Hornet

857
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Experience this evening for that

858
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
From start to finish

859
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
So yes I agree

860
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
For them to get that Triumph was wrong

861
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
But says I'm pretty sure Jamie York it was

862
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
Really remarkable only for somebody

863
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,687
So when I went to Kenya and I was talking to these people who would live through the emergency

864
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Wanted to know about

865
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:01,599
What they thought of the settlement

866
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
And a lot of them are like

867
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
What settlement

868
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
The the hot

869
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
Rumors about the government

870
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Britain Avenue

871
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
A green to apologize

872
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
Some of them and heard about it some of them hadn't but it doesn't

873
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
Really matter to them

874
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
To the people that got paid that's just

875
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,591
Tiny sliver of the vast majority of people who suffer

876
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,919
Who has you do good at whatever

877
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
What this one guy told me is that what he in

878
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Most people what they what they want

879
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Need

880
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,879
Isn't so much an acknowledgement it's it's

881
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
Take back what was taken from them

882
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207

883

884
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
One can keep

885
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
Some go to

Ghost

887
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
That guy

888
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,519
So that he can do what any 18. Year old wants to do

889
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
Leave something behind
