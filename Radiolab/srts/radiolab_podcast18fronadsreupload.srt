Erie Pennsylvania second attempt at Erie first attempt was snowed out on the New York side thank you bomb cyclone

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,312
It was like the Arctic winters of my youth are ice fishermen out on the lake

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
There was like some sort of Records

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Snowfall in Erie that I'm

00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,480
Schurz probably still melting up there

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
And I had landed in this in this Frozen land

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,648
To do a story about people freezing things

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Tofutti cuties

33
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
That's a crazy story. I told you that right

00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Can you put the phone on him like you

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520

46
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128

00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
The future

00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
Like they were going to be together what do you want

74
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
What do you imagine and we just kind of were

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
You're talking about all sorts of things like kind of a little to goal-setting that we like how much

76
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
What you want to make it real casual where do you want to live

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
Florida would like that the climate we put the on there I think something like we want to be in Florida in 2005

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
They're jotting down children together to kids at least

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Agreed on that Greg had already expressed at some point the family was super important to him he loves having brothers and sisters

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
Like we went to Christmas Eve this past Christmas and

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
I need the

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
45 people there

83
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
It was all family but it's like they don't write down that they just want to have kids they start writing down

84
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Jack Tower

85
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Jimmy

86
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,903
Tyler Joseph Joey's real names were throwing around boys names and then we had four girls Taylor

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Madeline Bobbi with an i because his dad's name was Robert in the neighborhood our own names down on it

88
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
And he signed the day

89
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
I just want to say guys this doesn't seem casual

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Pretty intense

91
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,223
Casual dinner we covered it all

92
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,599
Your definition of casual and mine are very different

93
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
A few months after that date

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
They gone one of their first big trip

95
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
To the Superbowl

96
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,471
In Tampa Bay

97
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
And

98
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
The morning of the Super Bowl

99
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
We are laying in the hotel room and I woke up and I felt like

100
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
She had

101
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
This feeling of a weight

102
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
On her chest

103
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
100 pound weight sitting on my chest

104
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Like I couldn't catch my breath

105
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
Should we come back from the Super Bowl they go to the doctor doctor runs a bunch of tests

106
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
And then a week later they go back

107
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
And

108
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
They're like you want the good news or the bad news and I was like the bad news

109
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
It's not like

110
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
It's cancer

111
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Okay

112
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Not good

113
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
It turns out she had this

114
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Are you big tumor

115
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Write down her breast

116
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
Plate like where your ribcage meets like right over your heart and lungs

117
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
How big are we talking

118
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Grapefruit size

119
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Wow

120
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
You know you think he answering you want me to think you're dying

121
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,863
Are you going to die but her doctor said good news is that is Hodgkin's lymphoma

122
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
And it has a cure rate of like 95 /

123
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
She said that the doctor literally was like

124
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Spine called it a slam dunk

125
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
But

126
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
It's still super scary any cancer scare you

127
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Findom

128
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
At some point and he finds herself sitting down with Greg and saying

129
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
You don't have to

130
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,159
You didn't sign on for this like we haven't even been dating a year yet you know you're young

131
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,303
Hey there good-looking guy you can find another girl and you can be guaranteed like

00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Wicked future

133
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
You know I said run

134
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
When we got diagnosed

135
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
It's just like boom

136
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Just like we would have to

137
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Trust

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
From

139
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,383
Kindest Fast Track relationship and we're really having fun and join each other moving moving pretty quick

140
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
And then bam we got hit with that

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
So you got to do one or two things USA do I

142
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,111
Do I love this woman in am I ready to go on this kind of this tough Journey that's going to be had

143
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
Or am I going to get out

144
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,743
There's going to be one of the other right there's no gray in that Cincinnati

145
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
So

146
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
That's when I

147
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Right

148
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Upholsterer

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Well

150
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Okay she says yes

151
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
And so like newly-engaged that go through this cancer treatment

152
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,871
In about nine months later after all the treatments done she goes in for another scan

153
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
And all of the cancer

154
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Is totally eradicated

155
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
Except for this one thumbnail size

156
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Tumor.

157
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Grapefruit

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
Tumor out of my chest to my spleen dissipated

159
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
It was still their waist smaller but it was still there right in the middle of her chest and if that point

160
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
The doctor looks scared I saw Terror in his eyes like he was he was

161
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Was confused

162
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
Cuz he was like I gave you the normal regimen

163
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
There must be something else going on like that should be gone

164
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,807
Didn't know what else to do

165
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,487
Buttendz insurance work with a good cover that so they just decide

166
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Screw it let's just get married right now

167
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,399

172
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639

It's a big

174
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
What if

00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
I've looked over your test results

184
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
And you have stage 4

185
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

186
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
She gets very aggressive

187
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
And

188
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
It's a 70% chance you're going to die

189
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
I just remember feeling like

190
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,087
Kind of like with her words and how quick they were in kind of cold it was kind of like

191
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Might not

192
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
Turn out the way we both really really wanted to

193
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Ask the doctor how you treat this

194
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Your says it's this super intense chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant which is

195
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
A very intense procedure and then I asked her

196
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,207
What can I do about my fertility and she looked at me like I had three heads you know like

197
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
My darling

198
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Forget the fertility

199
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
You're fighting for your life

200
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
A nanny says back to her

201
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
No I want children

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Like I don't think you get it

203
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
We have a plan

204
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,615
I put this on a placemat I signed it I'm going to beat this you might not believe it

205
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
I believe

206
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
I'm having kids

207
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
I'm having kids with Greg

208
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,551
And when I asked her why she was so adamant about it she just said

209
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
It was a couple of thing

210
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:39,487
One she was always really wanted to be a mom that's what I wanted I wanted to be a mom

211
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,887
Just Married Greg just made this promise that they could have kids together and she felt like if she

212
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Couldn't do that she was breaking

213
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
That promise

214
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Okay so I get through it and then

215
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,359
He's maybe not going to want to be with me anymore like you know like once I get healthy because

216
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
He's got dreams of himself individually like separate from mine you know even though we're married you know I mean like

217
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
Kind of like a worried that like maybe if we can't have

218
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Have kids but like we might break up

219
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Not really a worry

220
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
But I thought, you know as usual a there in your

221
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Well I definitely wanted kids

222
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
You know but I wasn't

223
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
I don't know where this goes I'll be I'll be happy

224
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
And so

225
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
We are Focus my focus

226
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
I'm getting her healthy

227
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
It was interesting cuz whenever they talked about like kids

228
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Or when there is M at that time like

229
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Trying to get through stuff they kept

230
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Throwing their hands kind of forever they kissed

231
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Keep saying like

232
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
Like they were like tossing something in front of him they would make the gesture of life

233
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Of like

234
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
I'm going to stand like throwing a ball out

235
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Get your hand gestures are in

236
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Interesting cuz everytime you talk about kids

237
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
You're like

238
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Shooting your hands out away from your body like

239
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,919
Putting something out there in front of you that then you can like he of Yourself chords

240
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
All right

241
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Reel it in you know you're out there

242
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Circular things you can see it

243
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
I don't know I just felt like it was

244
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Hope

245
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Of

246
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
There's the gold go get it

247
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
So

248
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Portlock is like

249
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
No I don't think you understand like

250
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
We need to get you in treatment right away like within like maybe a week

251
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,847
And any fertility treatment would take too long like egg freezing takes too long IVF

252
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
That would take weeks

253
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
But Annie is just like

254
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Come on anything give me a shot

255
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
And she just paused for about 30 seconds

256
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
And then she goes

257
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
There is a doctor

258
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Across the street at Weill Cornell

259
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
He is

260
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
A fertility specialist

261
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
She's doing a study right now

262
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
I don't know much about it but

263
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
I will make sure you have an appointment tomorrow morning

264
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
So the next morning Annie is in the doctor's office across

265
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
The street and in walks this mystery.

266
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
All right the duck is in the house

267
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
Crazy curly black hair

268
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Me and a white lab coat on for faster

269
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
And like

270
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,391
I kind of like this guy don't know why I like this guy

271
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Do you remember when you met her

272
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Yeah and was one of the

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,815
First few patients that we did the freezing for

274
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,703
Oh this is our guy from a episode 1 Mr magical Donuts on Hazard a magical Oregon

275
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Yeah

276
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,871
Okay we're back with the magic of the gonads we're about to re-enter the magic land

277
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
And he's also the guy that brings us to freezing

278
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
But

279
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
First a little contact

280
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
Acquired an egg and sperm and sex

281
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
And then

282
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
Some magic happened and a baby popped out

283
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
We started trying to figure out how to control that process

284
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
So what starts

285
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
The freezing of reproductive parts

286
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,127
Don't started with sperm 1700s they realize that

287
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Sperm

288
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,991
Slow down and became really sleepy when it got cold

289
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
I don't know but that's what they saw

290
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
It wasn't until the 1950s and they actually figured out how

291
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
To freeze sperm thawed sperm

292
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
And then use that to make

293
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
A real baby

294
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
And then

295
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
It's like okay well

296
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
We figured out sperm that's like half the population

297
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
So what about

298
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Eggs

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
And so they start trying to

300
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Freeze eggs that that turns out to be a lot harder

301
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Because eggs are so

302
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Full of liquid

303
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
So when you try and freeze them ice crystals for a minute

304
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Pierce's the egg

305
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,743
And it's at this point sort of in the 90s that act a walks into the room

306
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
He was studying

307
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Kind of

308
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Eggs in general and fertility

309
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
And he ends up in a lab

310
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
That is saying you know if we can't freeze eggs

311
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
Maybe what we should actually do is just freeze the ovary

312
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Which is a totally different ballgame because an ovary is an entire organ

313
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
I'm a big

314
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
How big is

315
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
7/8 minutes the size of like a

316
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
I don't know a walnut

317
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
But yeah it's not a small task it is still a whole working

318
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
And that is actually what is

319
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Cool about this whole thing

320
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
Because it is the Egg Factory

321
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,215
See if you can figure out how to freeze an ovary you can potentially freestyles

322
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
The banks

323
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
And so

324
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
When an e shows up onto the scene

325
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
This was just an idea it had never been done before

326
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,063
Different animals but the idea that Hansel doctors including okte had was

327
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
4 women and an e situation you know let's freeze some of your ovarian tissue and then maybe one day that technology

328
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Will catch up

329
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
And we can do something with it

330
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
So when Annie walked in the door

331
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
How

332
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Experimental was what you were doing

333
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
No it was a highly experimental because

334
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
She was one of the first few patients

335
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
And he comes in and

336
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
She says

337
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
There's this thing

338
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,295
It's ovarian freezing this is brand-new I've never successfully done this in a human

339
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
There were no pregnancies are in

340
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
He told Annie what I'm doing here is a shot in the dark and this is like the basketball shot all the way across the court at the buzzer

341
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
But unfortunately this is your only option

342
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
And then she said she was basically Life Bouquet

343
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
He explained the process the new this is what we will try to do we can take out one of your ovaries freeze it in liquid nitrogen

344
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
And then

345
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
If you survived your cancer which is big if at this point

346
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
And if you make it to the two-year Mark which is a big landmark

347
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
For cancer survivors

348
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
We can look at reimplanting it

349
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
You just hear those papers you like sign away so I can

350
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Sign my name like

351
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Do you remember when any of the waivers were

352
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
I just signed everything

353
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Didn't read it just sign

354
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,095
Like he could have been the first sighting it's a China we're going to have babies with like your ovary over there

355
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
I did not like

356
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
I did not like to pay any attention

357
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
I just wanted a chance

358
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Coming up she gets a chance

359
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
And things get weird

360
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,991
Emily Webster this is gonads on Radiolab

361
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Stay tuned

362
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
This is Kelly powers in El Cerrito California

363

Radiolab presents gonads

364
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Is supported in part by science and box assignments Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process

365
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Science

366
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,655
Additional support for Radiolab is provided by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

367
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,031
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

368
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:53,151
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a series of Stories on the show

369
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
And I request

370
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

371
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

372
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
So did something

373
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

374
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

375
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

376
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in

377
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

378
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
If you have a story please share it with us

379
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327

Fan that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

382
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
It's Molly we're back

383
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Picking up where we left off its right after getting this

384
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,279
Terrible cancer diagnosis in Annie is in the OR and Doctor Octopus

385
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Takes out one of her ovaries

386
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
What walk me to the operation what's involved

387
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
As far as surgeries go it's

388
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
It's super simple easy painless

389
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
He put you under anesthesia and then he makes

390
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,223
An incision in her abdomen where you go through patients bellybutton with a camera and then

391
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Two little love

392
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,343
Punctures along the bikini line and we can pull the ovary out

393
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Through that incision in the belly button

394
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,279
And then they drop it in a freezer this is like a 45-minute the outpatient procedure

395
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Once it's done you just walk home yeah oh yeah

396
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
A week later

397
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
She's at Memorial Sloan-Kettering getting chemo

398
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
And the treatment is like

399
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Saying

400
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,735
She goes through rounds of chemotherapy where she gets chemo all weekend in a lake the big

401
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Ziplocs like the freezer bags like the gallon

402
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
That's what they were hanging up

403
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Field of chemo

404
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Thumbs up

405
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
Down one up time for another one

406
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Down one up time for another one

407
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Time for another one

408
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
Constant in this kind of chemo they kill a lot of

409
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Cells in your body

410
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:30,847
Good cells your bad cells your immune cells are stem cells they kill everything you're basically dead for all

411
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Purpose of them in the blood counts are all by no doubt there's no there's nothing

412
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Is there a whitetail red Zara playlist

413
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,647
From there she gets a stem cell transplant which is taking your blood out and putting stem cells back in

414
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,023
India is at then she would regrow her immune system hopefully without cancer

415
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
May 26th

416
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
I walked out of

417
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Annie is

418
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
False no eyelashes no eyebrows

419
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
Skinny male stores it sucks

420
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
But according to the doctors

421
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
They were like you're good she's cancer-free

422
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,343
You're clear so when we got out we walk to the park

423
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Got slice

424
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Her people was at the greatest pizza ever

425
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
The sun is shining and horns honking and it was New York like it was like I said as I not like

426
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Like this is life

427
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
There was

428
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
Pretty good chance that the cancer could come back

429
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Pusheen Greg go home and

430
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Wait

431
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
1 month goes by

432
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
That place Matt was just like

433
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Hanging like on the fridge Rent-A-Center like

434
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Floating there

435
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
3 months

436
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
For I would think about the cancer

437
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Most of the day

438
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Where would like

439
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Is it going to go back

440
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Where is it

441
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Bye

442
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Fix

443
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
A year goes by than 18 months

444
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Still no cancer

445
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
When did you

446
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
First have the ovary reenter your mind

447
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Well

448
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
Started to I went

449
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
May 13th of 04

450
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
You know the two-year mark

451
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
They did a pet

452
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
Pet scan blood work all that and

453
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
I was clear

454
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
And that

455
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Jay wenzhou Lactaid

456
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Just walked across the street

457
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,032
In what you remember is the last time she talked to aktay the deal was

458
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
Get to the two-year Mark if he gets the two-year Mark give me a call I have no idea where will be at with this technology

459
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
No idea if I'm going to be able to give you a baby but we'll see

460
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,392
Now in that interim period in those two years okte had been continuing to experiment

461
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Working with other patients taking thought tissue and putting it back in them

462
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
What not wear YouTube

463
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Expect

464
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
Originally we did this in the forearm

465
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,752
Like my under my watch like on my forearm

466
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Correct it would just take it and stick it in the muscle

467
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
In the forearm

468
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
An ovary in the forearm

469
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
How does that even make sense

470
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,760
Will it make sense because this is how crazy weird

471
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Like an ovary is

472
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,672
You can put it literally anywhere in the body that has good blood supply

473
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Nginx

474
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
3 to 10 days

475
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
New blood vessel

476
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
So just it just pops on

477
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,680
How do you get a baby out of an ovary that's in your forearm

478
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
Oh so the idea is

479
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
That you could just

480
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Yesterday

481
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Lock the mature eggs

482
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
Out from just underneath the skin

483
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,248
And then you could combine them with a sperm in a Petri dish and just do normal IVF read makeup

484
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Umbreon petri dish and then implant

485
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
Got you but by the time an Ewok didn't know one had done this and gotten it to work there had yet to be

486
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
A baby born from an ovarian trance

487
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
When Anna showed up though

488
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Octavius ready

489
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
He said I'm going to take the 21 in strips

490
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,472
These little bits of her ovary that have been frozen

491
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
For two years so we're going to suit your own right underneath your your belly button in your stomach

492
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,736
Well he has he put prior to me he had put a few in a woman's rear end

493
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
No really it actually wasn't in that did that but rumor on the street is that there's no Rihanna but somewhere but he's cell

494
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
That putting it closest to where

495
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
The other ovary is and where its original spot was

496
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Was probably the most beneficial migas

497
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Hopefully within 2 months you'll get

498
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
Menstruation cycle and he goes and then you'll come out of menopause

499
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,312
Cuz remember that chemo would shut down that remaining over and put her in a full on menopause

500
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
We don't

501
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
We just got to say

502
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,784
Swanky does the procedure again it's super simple implants a few bits of over in the skin next to your belly button

503
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
2 months later started field first little marbles

504
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,232
Down around her belly button have these lumps

505
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
Describe it but like under the skin can actually like kind of grab it

506
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
Put your finger right here you could you can feel them and should you notice certain times of the month that they would be able to get images

507
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Bigger

508
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Eggs on the skin

509
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
It was really weird I mean I have all different sizes like sometimes less than a dime sometimes as big as a quarter

510
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
I just feel like if you rub your finger across

511
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
Almost like just a bigger version of kind of like to hit you know they have the money I'd like to Braylon the elevators

512
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Talk to it actually measure them

513
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:43,680
The interesting measuring tape in like put like marks on and he'd like measure the circumference he like

514
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
It's good.

515
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:51,616
He says they hurt me I couldn't buckle my jeans cuz the bucket like the button on the jeans would hurt

516
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Pressing against

517
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
Skin cuz they were sticking out you know

518
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
To Alaska

519
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Pants are like real pretty

520
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,576
So about a month after the Marvel show up

521
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,928
They find out in New York City for a series of appointments

522
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
First

523
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
Eye cancer check-up to get a PET scan

524
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
Next day they go Seahawks

525
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
And that's when

526
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
All these interesting things beginning to happen

527
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
Andy's on the exam table for sandwiches always so uncomfortable and then all of a sudden

528
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Autism

529
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Oh my God

530
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Oh my God

531
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,296
And I think I almost passed out

532
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
And I'm like

533
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Is everything okay

534
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
He's like this

535
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
This can't happen

536
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
Dr. Hockett what is wrong

537
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Hold on

538
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,888
Makeup look look and he's looking at the Monitor and doing also

539
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
I said what can't be he was

540
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
You're pregnant

541
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
What

542
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
Yeah it was just

543
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
An unbelievable moments

544
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
I was like

545
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
I'm pregnant

546
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:04,064
No looking at the right patients take a look at the chart again

547
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Wait she's pregnant

548
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
What is that mean

549
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean no one really knows what it means it means that there are eggs that are protruding out of foreskin

550
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328
And yet somehow there's also an embryo in her uterus

551
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
I said

552
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
How

553
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,472
The old-fashioned way sweetheart

554
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
He was like no no really

555
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
How

556
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
He's like

557
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
I don't know

558
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
And then

559
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
He's like wait

560
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm trying to find a heartbeat

561
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
It turns out there was no heart

562
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
It's not viable

563
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
And it

564
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
It goes on from there

565
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
They get into the car

566
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Phone rings

567
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
It's dr. Moskowitz from Sloan

568
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Like why is he calling us

569
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
The shoes going to drop

570
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
The cancer's back right cuz we just had a pet scan like

571
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Literally the the day before

572
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
So she picks up the phone like everything okay

573
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
He's like your scans are

574
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Uclear

575
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Okay

576
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
I thought you're coming cuz I know what you thought

577
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
Izzy's I was calling to tell you that the answers back and make it back to the hospital and I was like yeah

578
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Music note

579
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
You're cancer-free

580
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Did you know you're pregnant

581
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Just found out

582
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
I think you want to talk to and I said yeah

583
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Did you know your pregnant before your the Patsy

584
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
I said

585
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Now

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
The Pet Scan of killed it

587
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
He said yes

588
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
So that was

589
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Cuz it was like

590
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Shat

591
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Why that is crazy whiplash

592
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Wait can I just

593
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
You just catch up here

594
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
How did this

595
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Like she's got marbles in her belly by

596
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Marble Center Valley

597
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
And now you're saying that suddenly a baby appeared in her uterus

598
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
It's a long way away from her belly button

599
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
I don't get it

600
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
I don't get it likes it what did the belly button

601
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Is it

602
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
What happened

603
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
That that's the quest

604
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,272
There are so many different definitely something

605
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Happened there

606
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
And what was that something

607
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
Divine intervention

608
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't know

609
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
So act a Venturi does publish to papers on this

610
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
And he raises like a lot of different ways

611
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
This could happen

612
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
In Annie says maybe the thing to remember for all these explanation

613
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,056
So if you think about Annie's body right now there's the one ovary that was left inside

614
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
That is now defunct

615
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
Describes

616
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Dead over

617
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
It's been killed by the chemo

618
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
Right so you got the dead ovary Insider you've got the transplant a lower belly button in the skin

619
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
Which is very much alive full of eggs little Marvel

620
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
So

621
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
To get a pregnancy

622
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Here's what might have happened couple different option

623
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
First

624
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Maybe

625
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
One of these immature

626
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Turn of egg

627
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Sal's near belly button

628
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
Flips out of the transplanted ovarian tissue

629
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
It's into the bloodstream is transported through the bloodstream all around the body

630
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Opposite ovary

631
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
The Dead one where

632
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
It is like this is the place I want to be

633
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,880
Saddles and then in there is

634
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Matured

635
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
And then can be sucked up by the fallopian tube and made into a baby

636
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Correct sir

637
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
Biologically speaking

638
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
It's plausible

639
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Let's remember

640
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
Germ cells got to the ovary three long migration

641
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,520
Remember last episode with Great Migration The Great Migration

642
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
This will be the Great Migration * a million cuz it's going all around the body yeah

643
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,456
The most likely and most reasonable

644
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,248
That probably happened

645
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Is

646
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
That the ovarian trance

647
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,720
Plant in reconnecting with the body sends out its signal is like hey hey hey hey

648
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
We got some hormones going on here

649
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
These

650
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Hormones

651
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
Help the other ovary

652
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Wake up

653
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
Turn back on

654
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
And then if it had any remaining egg cells that were like dormant maybe you could

655
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
Rejuvenate them or get them to mature

656
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
And then throws could become a baby

657
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Well so either these eggs are going on a journey like no other

658
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Or

659
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
They're waking the Dead

660
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Yes to very reasonable option that's been both ways double banana it is so banana

661
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,096
That when it happened aktay just thought it was

662
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Luck

663
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,216
Like maybe that over inside of the Dead one just had like one last

664
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Stag

665
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
But

666
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
A month-and-a-half later

667
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Pregnant

668
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Again

669
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
In the same way

670
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Are uterus

671
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah like

672
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Crap

673
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
My body healed enough I could Excel

674
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Shiva pregnant

675
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
See without intervention

676
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
And so

677
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
September 25th

678
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
2005

679
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,104
Sienna and dower was born a healthy baby weighing 8lb 6oz

680
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,176
The first baby ever born in the US of an ovarian trance

681
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,760
Even though the chances of conceiving a child was Unthinkable like

682
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
1 and 5 million miracle baby

683
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:32,512
Greg Annie octech dr. Cutler poked eye little baby Sienna

684
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
Hit the road on a media blitz

685
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,912
She is now the mother of a bouncing baby girl the first ever to be born in the US

686
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
By using this particular

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
Technological breakthrough

688
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
So that happened

689
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
And then

690
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
3 years later

691
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Pregnant

692
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
It happened again with little Greg

693
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Same thing you'll fashioned way

694
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
And at this point they're like

695
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
We had a girl a boy there

696
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,208
Healthy no issues think on they felt like

697
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
We've executed

698
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
I dream of the place

699
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
No intention of having another one

700
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Like zero

701
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
But

702
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
4 months later

703
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
Pregnant

704
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,728
Again three babies

705
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,080
Back-to-back-to-back I mean how do you become super fertile

706
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
After being in

707
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Clinical menopause for 2 years

708
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,416
Does he still think there any and Greg got lucky that this was kind of a one-off

709
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,768
No because since Sienna was born we've had

710
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
Many more babies born from this procedure as we spend over a hundred babies

711
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
More all around the world

712
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
And it's no longer like just happening within the fertility Community I bumped it

713
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,712
Doctors that are experimenting using it with

714
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
Women's were going into menopause

715
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
An ovarian patch

716
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,136
That will inject hormones to delay menopause

717
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Are the other place I bumped into it is in the trans Community where kids who are transitioning from

718
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
From female to male

719
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Are opting to or their parents are choosing to freeze or ovary so they have a chat

720
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
Chance of possibly having by Logic

721
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Kids

722
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
If they

723
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Want to do that

724
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,200
So it is it is cool because you you have this feeling of like when I was

725
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,784
Standing in the room with Annie I kept having this like feeling of

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
You just feel like

727
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
