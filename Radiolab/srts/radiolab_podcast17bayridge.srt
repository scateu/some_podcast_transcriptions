00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616

Okay what you have to tell me

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
Couple months back I took the train down to Southern

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
To a little neighborhood called

10
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Bay Ridge

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
Best known for his portrayal in the movie Saturday night

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Fever

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,992
You weren't heading there for Disco

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
No

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
The auditorium appears to be

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,672
Showing up I was actually down there to go to this Catholic

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
High School

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Go to the classic High School auditorium sloping down with the stage in front in like an American flag on one side of the stage and

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
New York State flag on the other maybe a thousand seats

20
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,312
And I would say half of them are filled like surprisingly there's a big turnout for this thing

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
You look familiar

22
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Look familiar have you seen me before

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Amanda such a handsome

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
And dad would not be unfair to say that

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
Proud as an average age of

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
62 the reason I was there

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Come see the debate

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,816
Ways to watch the local candidates for the New York City city council

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Duke it out

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Who's most likely to do something for you do you think

31
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
I have no idea

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
I've been hurt on both sides

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
And that was talking to people beforehand

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Weaving in and out of the other chairs

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,944
The issues that people were concerned about we're really what you would expect

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,552
Are we in this neighborhood for 5 years I've been fighting for a light

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,160
In the meantime I get aggravated we have to run for our lives when we cross the streets here

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Guitar

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
You know

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Small stuff

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Taking away the $0.05

42
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
A bottle tax

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
When you drink a lot of Mountain Dew or something so this $0.05

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,704
It jumps up the price when I buy those 24 packs

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
The water

46
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Whereabouts

47
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,688
Eventually the MC for the evening this woman in her 70s dressed from head to toe in

48
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Walks out onto the

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
The stage

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
We've had a great selection here

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
But the candidates up

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
5 democrats for Republicans they sit down at their respective tables and

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Okay we're ready

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Get on I'm off

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Gadsden

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Dial

57
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
And it first

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
After City

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
City Council

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,848
I will help and make sure that those that I've Limited in, Road

61
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Pretty dry

62
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Will have enough

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
And we helped

64
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
How to take care of that

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Pek

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Pets

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah

68
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
To put them down

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
But then about an hour and a half into it

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
There's this moment where

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
What are your solutions for the overcrowding

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
One of the Republican candidates this

73
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
Guy Bob capano

74
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Goes off on this riff

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
It's a matter of budgetary priority

76
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,384
It takes money to build schools so perhaps if we put it in

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
273 Sanctuary City policy

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Like spending 27 million dollars

79
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
Defend those here illegally who commit felonies

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Trump deportation

81
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
The Hat

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
And then just as it seemed

83
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,448
Seems like people were settling down

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Democrats right

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568
This man on the

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Far right side of the auditorium

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Stands up and then goes on to say

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
Get the Arab people

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
The freaking Asians out of here

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,744
Rolling right along why are you selling your house

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
You're letting everybody take over

92
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
OK Google

93
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
Everybody sort of sat up in their seats

94
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,031
And nobody was quite sure if this thing we can escalate

95
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Shortly after he said this

96
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
One of the candidates up on stage

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
This tall guy like six-foot-three salt-and-pepper beard

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Stood up

99
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,575
From behind the table and actually walked out

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,415
In front of it

101
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
And I and said

102
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
There is an elephant in the room and stop racism and discrimination in Disk Utility right here

103
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
American Pacific

104
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
So the reason I was at this debate is

105
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Like it feels right now

106
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Like America is just added phone throat

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
Certainly have divided is ivory

108
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
I just keep wondering like in this moment can one person stand for all of us

109
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Anymore and here you got this guy

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
We got you just heard

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Heather Elliott team

112
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
A palestinian-american

113
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
Trying to win an election in one of the most conservative and most divided neighborhoods in New York

114
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,319
And he's running on behalf of a group of people who currently are at the flashpoint of those two

115
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Arab-american month

116
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,463
And just make things a little more complicated

117
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Heather Elliott team

118
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
Is a Christian

119
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
The love of God and the communion of the Holy

120
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Christian minister

121
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Check check check

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Sat down with him in his office

123
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Sex for the first time

124
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
I am an Arab American Palestinian Christian

125
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,375
Lutheran Pastor in Southwest Brooklyn running for office

126
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,591

In south west of Brooklyn

128
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
Who is running for City Council

129
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Because I want to bring

130
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
And you

Fresh inclusive powerful voice to present our district and city council

133
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Is that you got a nice Cadence there you that you said that

134
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
You're not being a preacher

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,655
What's a good backstory how did he end up being in Brooklyn and running for

136
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
For the sea

137
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
Christian song He was born and raised in Bethlehem on the Westbank

138
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,895
Christian home into a family that was

139
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
Portland middle class

140
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Father was a carpenter and made most of his money

141
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Carving you know those little like nativity scenes with the wooden camel and the wooden Christ he carved those

142
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,999
My mother was a housewife and she had my father in the factory they work

143
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,399
Extremely hard to provide for us a good life so it's it was amazing wonderful Simple Life

144
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,775
But it wasn't the complicated so I went to school grew up in the church

145
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
After High School Elliot team went into the Seminary and Bible College

146
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,735
And then when he was in his second year this is 1989 I was arrested

147
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Bye-bye Israeli soldiers

148
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
I was picked up from my bed from home

149
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
At 3 in the morning

150
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
And they took me to prison

151
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
For what reason

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,679
I don't know I never been given a reason why I was arrested I never been

153
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
Convicted of anything I was picked up from my bed at 3 in the morning from my father's house and take a

154
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,223
Going to prison I was in a sweater confinement in in a small self he says that the Israeli soldiers

155
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Stickley tortured him hitting me and putting me outside against the wall of the back of my head under the rain and the cold

156
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
And they kept asking me you tell us what you did wrong place what you did wrong

157
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
I said I have nothing to tell you

158
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
2 months later

159
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
He was released

160
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
With no explanation

161
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
When you got home after I get back from Kmart from prison there's a lot of people came to our house

162
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
They will save all look to see what they did to you now you have to do this to them

163
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,759
You don't need to come to recruit you to belong to a political party

164
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
In this case it was the Palestinian Liberation Organization which at the time was explicitly an armed resist

165
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Distance movement that often targeted Israelis

166
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,095
And then they will say I would like to see what they did to you now you have to do this to them

167
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Blessed absolutely no

168
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
This is not the way I want to live the rest of my life

169
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
You know I always wanted to

170
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,871
Be engaged in a place where I can bring hope I can

171
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Help people

172
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,527
And the only way I can do that was it through a being become a minister

173
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
So he doubled down in his studies

174
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Seminary with working in Palestine

175
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
And then

176
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
In the early 90s

177
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,535
He's at he was actually sent to start a new Lutheran Church

178
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
In Bay Ridge Brooklyn

179
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
So I came to Brooklyn 1995

180
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,031
I remember on the first day I was shocked

181
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Because

182
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,199
Biking down Fifth Avenue if you take the whole neighborhood in we are in Bay Ridge

183
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
Which I actually did not too long ago on a bike what you notice is

184
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
On the right we have Leif Erikson Park

185
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
A nod to the

186
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Neighborhood

187
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Scandinavian pants

188
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
This sort of crazy mix of different kinds of people

189
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
The Bay Ridge Bakery beautiful neon sign

190
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Looks like it hasn't changed much since the 1960s

191
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Johnny pumps

192
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Fireman bar firefighter bar

193
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Can I hit record

194
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I did record

195
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Pirate

196
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
Skinflints Pub it's sort of like looking at a geological cross-section of the neighborhood history The Bean post Pub

197
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,767
Schnitzel House on the Left can see how groups of people layered themselves on top of groups of people

198
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
Making themselves part of one of the most deeply mixed neighborhoods in the country

199
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
When you get just a little bit South

200
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
It's impossible to not notice one of the latest

201
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Trying to settle in

202
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,247
Popular crime furniture from Sky by car to Yemen Cafe El Sahara halal meat

203
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Women walking around in hijab

204
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
Hookah lounge hookah nuts that

205
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Nice

206
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Turkish kebab

207
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Azar

208
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
What and how large is the Arab community in the 43rd.

209
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
We don't have the exact

210
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Because again

211
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
When The Simpsons

212
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Department

213
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
10 years ago they told the Arab Community if you're an Arab

214
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Chick

215
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
White

216
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
So we don't have specific numbers

217
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
But the estimate I heard her somewhere between 20 and 30

218
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Living in southwest

219
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
That's a huge community

220
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
Yeah I mean that's only about 10% of the total population

221
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,231
But in a Democratic primary for city council we need only about 4,000 volts to 1

222
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
4000

223
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Total ya

224
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,631
That's it I mean the turnout is very low

225
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
And we have an open seat

226
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
So we'll have a bigger chance

227
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Winning because we're not running against an incumbent

228
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
How what's the margin of Victory to

229
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
They can be squeakers eye mean

230
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Justice several years back

231
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
The race was won by just

232
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
31 volt

233
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:11,391
31 yes so it would seem that if this guy can just

234
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
Despite the fact that there's never been an arab-american on city council before

235
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,583
It seems that if he can get out the the arab-american vote

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,447
He's got a shot what shot mean do you just told us there's a lot of Arabs there so he should

237
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
You should own insulin

238
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
Actually yes but at the same time this neighborhood is such a microcosm

239
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:37,759
I think that Islam is an evil ideology that's what I think everything that's going on

240
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Caleb deputy director of the Arab American Association of New York

241
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
And she said if you look around the neighborhood you'll see all these sort of national level issues

242
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
Playing out on the ground like a shadow play or something

243
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
I mean you've got neighborhoods in the country right

244
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Right next to all of these people who voted for Trump who support the travel ban

245
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
None 0 shifting National demographics were one of the last remaining New York City neighborhoods

246
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
Weather is still strong white working-class but is in the process

247
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,655
Being priced out gentrification is really kidding white people heart and so clearly there's going to be

248
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
Like we just got a lot of the elements of

249
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
Struggles and the anxieties that are going on a national level

250
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
So

251
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Candidate login

252
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
1:10 a.m. with all of this in mind we still are there in search for new voters

253
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Uteam

254
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,975
Along with the help with his campaign manager full of dad jokes

255
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,631
It's it's kind of amazing Kayla

256
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Have you guys become like best friends

257
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
She's my mother-in-law

258
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
When you call me your mother-in-law

259
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
Cuz I love my mother-in-law set up to represent

260
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
The Arab community

261
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
I am a candidate

262
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Going with no other candidates have guns

263
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
Before

264
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,367
Captain captain

265
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Anchorage

266
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
But

267
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Dad joke aside

268
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
It's true

269
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
She really is

270
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Trying something that's never been tried before

271
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
And one reason that it's never been tried before is that

272
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Is 20 some thousand arab-americans

273
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
The last 20 years

274
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
They've been hiding like for me to

275
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,943
It's been unnerving to take to be a district where you don't feel like people are watching out for you and your community

276
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
This is Linda sarsour

277
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
Xayah Palestinian Muslim American Community organizer born and raised in Brooklyn New York that uses bookkeeping tune

278
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
No is that not long after the 9/11 attacks

279
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
The US government in 2003

280
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
Did engage in a registration program a registry

281
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,191
Called en Sears National Security entry-exit registration system

282
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Which meant that males over the age of 16 who are from these like 29 countries of origin countries that have

283
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Had a historic

284
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,943
Connection to terrorism Bangladesh Pakistan Iran

285
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Iraq Egypt

286
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Go down the list

287
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
People from those countries that were visitors temporary workers

288
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Non US citizens

289
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,927
Had to come and formally register

290
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
With the federal government

291
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Tell me give me people

292
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Hitting us like animals

293
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,423
Linda was there with some of these men providing translation services

294
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
In this

295
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Post office like room where there are all these windows the men would be called Upon a Time photograph fingerprinted

296
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Passport ask them general questions

297
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
And I noticed that at one point that there were some men that were being told to either leave or just go home and got some stamps in their path

298
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Passport with future appointment

299
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Or they were telling him to go to the 10th floor

300
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
That's when my life

301
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,047
Something like I got punched in the stomach like I felt really nauseous I was like what's going on here

302
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,911
So when I went to ask the officer she was told the 10th floor was the FBI headquarters

303
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
This wasn't just an information-gathering operation

304
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
They were planning to deport

305
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
And as this realization sunken throughout the waiting room

306
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,175
I can't tell you the faces that these people had

307
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
Like they didn't know what their Destiny was

308
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
And in fact about 10% of those that did go register

309
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,183
We're put on deportation proceedings and many of them were deported no going home no packing a bag

310
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
And I think that's where the Divide start

311
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,047
And Saudi Arab American population in New York

312
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,375
Anna Bayridge learned it was better to not show up

313
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
To not be counted

314
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
Yeah and then just a few years later the Associated Press came out with their investigative report

315
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
Press reports details how Police use informants

316
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Police Department

317
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Operated on

318
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
Intelligence unit

319
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Turns out that after

320
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
911

321
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
The NYPD was putting large

322
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Sections of the community

323
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Under varying degrees

324
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Surveillance

325
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
This is Matt apuzzo, reporter

326
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,655
For the New York Times based in Washington and he along with his team at the AP back in 2011 broke this story

327
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
We found out there was a unit

328
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Call the demographics unit

329
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Terrain of New York

330
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
Snooping around neighborhoods going to different shops all the Muslim butcher shops the cafes the

331
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,647
Pause nightclubs restaurants down things like they play Al Jazeera

332
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
And it's this far from my mom

333
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Use informants known as mosque

334
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Crawlers are moths

335
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,399
Swonder surveil in the Arab community in Bay Ridge who had done nothing wrong they were terrified

336
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
I mean the police were even keeping track of their kids

337
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
But which Parks do our kids

338
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
Where where we're playing soccer

339
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,199
Couple things worth noting here at 1 in the end the operation never turned up any terrorist

340
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
Into when those things happen none of their local Representatives

341
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
No state legislator no local elected official stood up and said this is wrong

342
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
Don't Target my constituents you know these are these people are for my district

343
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Nothing

344
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
And

345
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
What that does is it makes you feel like the people quote

346
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Power

347
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Don't care about us like we were out on our own and I started realizing that there was going to have to be a moment where we

348
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
We had somebody in

349
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
In the local area

350
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
Somebody who is Arab

351
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Stand up

352
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
And protect us

353
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
And in this is where LOL your team steps

354
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,671
Linda started to raise these thoughts with imams and Business Leaders whole bunch of leaders from different insta

355
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
Tatoosh and decided the first step was to run a candidate for the New York City Council the idea was start small and

356
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Start in a place where they have a strong base

357
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Bay Ridge

358
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
Which also happened to be Linda's

359
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,847
And according to her lot of the unions and a lot of the people in politics were like Linda this is your seat

360
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
You have to run for the sea so I saw it like

361
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
Unfold before my very eyes

362
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,319
But is calling for a total and complete shutdown

363
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Of Muslims

364
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
Entering the United States

365
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Pallet exchange I think Islam

366
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,559
Hate us

367
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
We have to look at

368
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
The politically correct and

369
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,639
Executive director of the new political climate

370
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
I started doing a lot of national work

371
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
Chiusano the cable news shows

372
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
Became a national figure

373
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Really

374
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
A polarizer

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,487
Why is that well in large part because and I'm sure she would hate me saying this but

376
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
Herbrand ugly is very similar to Donald Trump

377
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
She can be very reactive

378
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
She's just going to say it like it is at a straight I'm very Brooklyn and maybe too cuz I was born and raised here but I tell it like it is

379
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
More than just telling it like it is she's the provocateur

380
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
She's tweeted some tongue-in-cheek post

381
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
About how Sharia law wouldn't be that bad

382
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,271
More recently she called CNN anchor Jake Tapper a member of the alt right

383
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
I mean she's brash

384
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
And clematis poster-child Linda sarsour the conservative media.

385
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Jumped all over for it

386
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
She is taking these missteps and warping them

387
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Is it totally unfounded

388
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943
Linda sarsour she is in extremis who has gas

389
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,551
Goddamn country

390
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
So it just didn't feel right at the moment

391
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
I didn't want to run for the New York City Council

392
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
And so after four or five years of

393
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,375
Planning organizing and laying the groundwork

394
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
So that Linda sarsour could run and represent the Arab community

395
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Lyrics suddenly this moment of

396
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Oh God. What are we going to do

397
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,943
You know just by the way again is Kayla santosuosso who at the time was working with Linda

398
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
At the Arab American association

399
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
And then I remember a moment when that be Association I walked in and I said to her like I just got out of him

400
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Meeting at father K Within

401
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,048
And I was like what that time I was like I think I was calling him a friendly demon remember what we was calling him but I was like

402
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,680
Don't you think he'd be a great person to run for Council and she likes land or hand down on the table and chairs

403
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Michaela

404
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
I was

405
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
Just thinking about

406
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
It was like a light bulb went off

407
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432
So we both like started going through our heads

408
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
Why he meets Us in the middle of that all these connections with people outside of the Arab Community he's a parent of public school students here

409
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,464
You work that an Orthodox Jewish hospital he's clearly Liaisons the NYPD is Lutheran he's Arab but he's

410
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Christian is not Muslim

411
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,144
And they start thinking like he's going to be able to get folks that no other Arab

412
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
Oh my God he's like the most

413
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
Intersectional

414
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
He's at jogging term he's like

415
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
The person with the most complex identity that might just be

416
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
So complex it'll work

417
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
And so they reached out to me on this it listen

418
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
We want you to do this

419
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,392
And you know he thought about the fact that doing this it would require him to quit his job it would be

420
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Family

421
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
But it felt again like

422
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Here with an opportunity to

423
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
To help the people around

424
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
The people in my community

425
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
So so I think I'm not sure if

426
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
Like the end of December

427
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Where I became like

428
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Yes 100 /

429
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
And so

430
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Couple months later

431
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,784
Announce on February 20th

432
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
This is my phone

433
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Vista

434
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
At La Saj restaurant a local Lebanese restaurant

435
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,352
Heading into the microphone blowing out the speakers

436
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,472
Every single seat was filled

437
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,800
And his message to them was essentially we can look

438
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,104
And live in the shadow anymore

439
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
We have to be engaged we have to be involved we have to be part of the decision-making in this country we have to bring our perspective to the

440
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Because

441
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
The fact is

442
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Other people cannot represent us

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
We have to present ourselves

444
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
Play I'm really getting lucky with the parking spots

445
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Your relationship with God

446
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
I think so

447
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm pretty much right off the bat those words like us

448
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
And ourselves

449
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
They presented a series of challenges

450
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Forefathers

451
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,184
The first one being a large number of Arab Americans who are

452
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
American citizens

453
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:04,352
But they are not registered and they refuse to be part of the political system in this country because they don't trust it

454
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Like here is a community that has

455
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Avoided government

456
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
To the nth degree for the past

457
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Decade-and-a-half

458
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
So what does he do

459
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,432
Well during the month of Ramadan is the holy month or four nights a week he would show up

460
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
To the mosque

461
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
Stack of literature

462
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
I need a larger stack

463
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Voter registration form

464
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
On the night I tagged along with him and his campaign manager Kayla

465
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
This month

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
It was hot

467
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Muggy

468
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352
Elliott team was dressed in his Minister garb

469
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,680
You know suit and collar

470
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
And as we walked into the mosque

471
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
It wasn't at all clear to me

472
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
How this was going to go

473
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
What's happening in the Middle East the world and the division and the different groups I was not sure if they were ready

474
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
Tea to support at Kendall see if an Arabic Christian to represent them

475
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
So we're standing in the back of this

476
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
Huge room

477
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,536
I have like Green carpet and a low low ceiling

478
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,632
There are like seven hundred people they are standing shoulder-to-shoulder

479
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
All praying in yunnan

480
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
Download MP3

481
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
And then

482
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
There's a break in the

483
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Salaam alaikum

484
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Polo bucket

485
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,528
I'll call you in to speak now to address the people so they know that I am here

486
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
So we sort of tiptoe through all these people

487
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
We are at the front of the Mustang

488
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,928
They introduce them

489
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
Hubbert Realty

490
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,400
Louisville mobile mechanic and he launched into the speech

491
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
New York

492
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
Basically saying you know this is our historic opportunity for the herb

493
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
Community to send their first ever

494
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Arab-american to city council

495
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,368
And even with the language barrier you can hear the passion in this speech

496
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
In a response that was

497
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Tepid

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Fbat

499
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
When he was done we headed out to the front of the mosque

500
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
And

501
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Is the service light out

502
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:28,736
Sea of 700 people come crashing out of the mosque

503
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,320
In

504
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
Their excitement for him is on open display

505
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
They're giving him hugs they're saying we're behind you we love you

506
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,632
The kids the best candidate in the field and he will represent the community

507
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
Only you can represent the community we are behind you 100%

508
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
Schedule

509
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
And that evening

510
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
12:25 in the morning

511
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
We are at

512
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,296
Number two

513
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
Good Luck Charlie

514
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,560
Each time that same energetic response everyone

515
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
People were signing

516
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,288
Petition to get on the ballot 39 Ogden Avenue

517
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
And registering to vote

518
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Register template

519
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
Register him

520
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
So you you just registered to vote

521
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Yes is my birth sign

522
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
Many of them for the first time

523
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
You're the best

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Did you just register

525
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Oh no just I'm

526
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
Only for him to just Add Water

527
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,560
You know me what's up brother

528
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Ultimately everybody thinks we're insane when we say we're investing a fair amount of our resources in people who have never voted before

529
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Foreign people are kind of like

530
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,824
What you doing don't do that as a waste of money

531
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,224
Because for many of these people the whole thing about registering and then later voting it was a foreign language

532
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
Which of them

533
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
Sometimes when he'd ask people to register to vote

534
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
They respond

535
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
We go to the give you money I understand but this is the process of other people thought that just registering to vote

536
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
With the same as voting for

537
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:24,960
September 12th

538
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,360
And on top of that we did see signs of that mistrust of government

539
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
You want to get the first Arab American and city council

540
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
First time for a lot of people

541
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
But still

542
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Crazy I didn't think it would get

543
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
After going from mosque to mosque

544
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Through all of Ramadan

545
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:58,240
5.3 months before the election we have registered opposed to 300 voters so

546
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,408
What do you think do you think you can get those four thousand foot from the from the Arab Community alone we are

547
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
You know

548
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,064
Not counting on that app that we can think about 1000 votes from therapy

549
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
With only a thousand votes

550
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,048
Yeah just as house but didn't you just say there were tens of thousands of arab-americans living there

551
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,400
So first of all if I get this correct about 250

552
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Are American boats

553
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Forecast

554
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
In the last couple primary

555
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
250 even getting to that one thousand number

556
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Who is going to be

557
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
I have you left

558
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
And there's one more ring

559
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
So in Brooklyn we have about eight hundred families that attend our church the folks you might expect to be

560
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
His most Ardent supporters

561
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
Other Arab American Christians

562
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
We Are Men

563
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,816
Ostrich in Egypt like Sharif here Sharif Sheriff Church

564
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,424
I don't know yet they were really uninterested in support

565
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
Will you be voting for father father Elia team

566
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
No no no

567
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Navigate yuan

568
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
The beginning of my campaign I tried to reach out to them for me personally

569
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:18,112
No no I don't know why is that and what what it what what's going on

570
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
Will the other be Christians in our districts are

571
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
The vast majority

572
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Republic

573
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,400
Yeah I will send 95% of them already

574
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
So that's number one number two

575
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
You have the situation in Egypt where Christians are being attacked

576
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
Killed after bombing Christian churches in Egypt churches are being burned

577
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,904
Are these radical groups of the Dead

578
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,976
UC

579
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Tensions

580
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,560
Swellinfo is there a level of distress

581
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,912
In the Christian Arab community of you because you are so

582
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,800
Close with the Muslim Arab Community here I mean I will give you an example

583
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,104
Close a friend of mine his name is Francois

584
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
So people went out to him and saying

585
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,968
How we cannot support him and he said why not

586
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Why is it because he's very close

587
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
Will the Muslims and they will take advantage of him

588
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
This is the dynamic this is what's happening

589
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,560
So eventually they decided only going after the Arab vote wasn't the right numbers game like that's just not

590
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,912
At work and see what that meant was to get 3000 volt

591
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
From the Arabs in the district

592
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
Who won this election

593
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,872
In other words he was going to have to convince the majority white voters

594
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
That she could represent them to

595
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Which wasn't going to be

596
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Alright walking down 50 year as I discovered when maybe a month before the election

597
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,440
I went on a stroll to try to take a pulse of some of the neighborhoods of white residue

598
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Have you lived here in Bay Ridge for a while

599
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Call my wife

600
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
Has the neighborhood changed a lot

601
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
Foreigners

602
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Then American

603
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
I was scary

604
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Listen

605
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Get so expensive

606
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,056
A 78 year old Irish woman

607
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,128
You have newcomers coming into

608
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
Art District

609
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
What do they know about

610
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Nothing

611
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Beijing Zoo

612
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,672
Not know and when I asked them about father Lu team specifically what did you know anything about it

613
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
No

614
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
I don't

615
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
And I don't care to

616
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Honestly I've never heard of them

617
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
The one that's

618
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
It's running

619
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
Right

620
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
His Egyptian

621
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Okay

622
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
Sumatriptan

623
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
That's how I feel

624
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
Completely turns me off

625
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
And just to be clear here

626
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
You're a Democrat

627
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Yes

628
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
These are Democrat

629
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,624
If anybody asks for Donald Trump when he was running

630
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
I said hell no

631
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
But I feel

632
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
This is Alex

633
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
This is America

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
And I feel American person

635
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Should be in office

636
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,984
Is that representative of what you heard was that street on that day yes

637
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
Clearly it's not like everyone down there has easy pay

638
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,968
This by no means excuses their behavior or language but I think it explains some of it that

639
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,528
DC rent prices going up and

640
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
Dozens of new Arab folks moving into the neighborhood every month these are not the gentrifying force though this is.

641
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Oddly enough

642
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
The Arab immigrants and even more so the Chinese immigrants

643
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
They in some ways are

644
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,960
Let's talk about the issues that I hear and every issue jumping back to the debate from the top of the Peace

645
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,056
This is one of the Republican candidates Lee in the cave

646
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,616
Weather it infrastructure and transportation

647
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:56,736
One particular issue in South Brooklyn and MattyB legal home conversion

648
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,064
Absolute my signature

649
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,160
Developers or landlords are taking the single family homes

650
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,488
Knocking out all the walls on the ground floor in the second floor

651
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
And then putting up these these

652
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Temporary walls

653
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Building these very

654
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Tiny

655
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
Cramped domicile

656
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
That they can then rent out to

657
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
10 or 15 sound

658
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
What that does

659
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Is first of all

660
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
Incredibly unsafe

661
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
For the people living in the house

662
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
But also it's putting stress on the sewer system and streets

663
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
It causes

664
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Classroom sizes to go up

665
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
Housing prices go up because there are just less actual single family homes on the market it's making

666
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,768
The neighborhood up more dense than it was ever meant to be

667
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,376
And so for a lot of these people who have lived in this neighborhood for a long time

668
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:51,264
I think it feels like their daily lives are being affected by these forces outside their controlling they are

669
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
Reacting emotionally to those thing

670
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
So you're fighting for

671
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,712
I'm fighting for the district fighting to make sure the quality of life example

672
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:05,856
Couple months before the election Elliott team was going around knocking on doors

673
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
We need to do an application form

674
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,512
Literature and accumulated protect Sanctuary City

675
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
No you don't have my birth is not a sanctuary City

676
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
Federal login

677
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
Thank you

678
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
Thank you

679
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
UPAC

680
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
And several of the Republican candidates

681
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,784
You know I deeply believe that illegal immigration

682
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
Has is a big root cause of this

683
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
You're trying to harness those emotion

684
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,488
You come here legally get a handout public health benefits

685
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,376
Republican

686
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,448
About me I am a radical

687
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
A lift is Palestinian cleric

688
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
Presumably they're using the word Claire insinuating that you are not are not in fact Christian but you are Muslim is that the incentive

689
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
Malaysian air

690
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
I plan the trying to use

691
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,832
The fear of the people against my candidacy

692
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,440
Then the comments and needed that post it is

693
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Just terrifying

694
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
I'm going to hang him

695
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
But for example one guy said all this one I cannot read it already but I will show it to you

696
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
He's a f****** a****** and should be treated as such

697
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,848
I have lived in this payment for the best 22 years and never in my life faced anything like this

698
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:38,016
And is very interesting because the attacks not only coming from Republicans but also coming from Democrats in the race

699
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,344
About the Democrats the donut kind of under the table

700
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,928
OU team claims that some of the Democrats are making the argument that

701
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes he might be able to win a Democratic primary

702
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Because he's Arab

703
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,608
He won't be able to win the general election

704
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
So don't waste your vote on

705
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,496
And Justin Brannan who's really The Establishment democratic

706
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,568
FrontRunner in the race is a flyers and Hazlett

707
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
This is our neighborhood our guy

708
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,688
So for me as a Native American who living here what that's

709
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Supposed to mean

710
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
It is a dog whistling

711
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,040
A statement

712
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Exclusion

713
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
And that I'll just say on that

714
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
As a white dude

715
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
From Wisconsin

716
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
When I see that fire I don't

717
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
See that division in

718
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Am I just blind to it

719
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
We you have to understand the context

720
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Cast of the neighborhood

721
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
And the context is

722
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,848
Everything wrong in the neighborhood is Plainville Daughter by the Chinese

723
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
You know

724
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
If the street is dirty because of these damn Arabs

725
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
You know like when I go out and say

726
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,856
I'm fighting for the community and say Jose is only fighting for his community

727
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,976
But if somebody else say the word Community it's okay it means everybody

728
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,304
I don't mean to push back but it seems like

729
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
It seems like you two are essentially doing the same thing to one another yeah he's saying when you say the word Community it's only about the Arab to me

730
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,824
And when he says our neighborhood you're saying he's just talking about the white folks

731
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
Isn't it the same thing happening about the Rex

732
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:18,624
It could be but we need to understand the background we have a president who you so much rhetoric

733
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
He came up with the Muslim ban

734
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,792
I'm building the wall and an attacking minorities and people of color

735
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
Our councilman and his death never took a stand on these issues and came out in support of the Arab and Muslim

736
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Give me the deets

737
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
You have to look at the history and will it seems like maybe his opponents are

738
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Playing up this kind of identity politics

739
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
Over and over again I saw Elliot team making it

740
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
Explicit attempt

741
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
To reach out across the boundary

742
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
Is a Republican

743
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Cider bar

744
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,536
He strolled up to the table of Burly white men

745
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
How are you into started giving hug

746
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,960
And I mean just listen to how Brooklyn he sounds you let's hear that once more

747
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:11,360
How you doing is he behaving

748
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Thing is been a really delicate line

749
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
Kayla santosuosso

750
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Because we really wanted to be honest and

751
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
And not adjust too much

752
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,928
But while also like letting people know that this campaign wasn't just for the yard Community it was for them as well

753
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
59

754
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,816
And so the campaign was also focusing on things that

755
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,888
12 things that matter to everyone what what's happening

756
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
They doing a complete renovation of the station

757
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
The station

758
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,128
No real daily life concerns 5 months

759
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
Chaotic morning Elliott team set up a Podium right in front of the cordoned off staircase of a close Subway stay

760
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,904
Station railed against the MTA for doing with next to no warning at all these repair that we're really just cosmetic

761
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Work needed at all

762
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
We think about all this

763
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:05,120
Students with a growth will think about our small business owners and master barber shops with who would be affected impacted

764
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
Proposing this station

765
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:12,544
For no reason I mean what's more unifying here in New York then complaining about the subway

766
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
And she also went after specific

767
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Groups

768
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Who are traditionally

769
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,600
I just want to say thank you so much for this opportunity to invite me to be

770
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
With you tonight

771
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,000
Like on this rainy Thursday night in this YWCA multi-purpose room

772
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,376
That felt a lot like an elementary school cafeteria

773
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
My reasoning why I'm learning Forsyth

774
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
City Council

775
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
And also to tell you

776
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,080
That I would be very proud to be the first one to represent

777
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
The Democratic Socialist

778
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
In City Hall who are the Democratic socialists

779
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
These are the Bernie Sanders

780
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,112
An important fact to know is there are lots of anti-establishment

781
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
White people in this District

782
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,000
This neighborhood in the presidential primary went Bernie and went Trump

783
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Beat Hillary in this test

784
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,608
So you think have to put on the clothes of

785
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
Yes Brooklyn Jew above

786
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,984
And watching him try to do that a couple things struck me

787
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
He said that was born and raised in Bethlehem Palestine and my father actually also Carpenter

788
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,968
Lauren London relationship

789
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
First

790
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:31,648
How he was intentionally bringing parts of himself to the four well pushing other parts into the background

791
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
So I'm going to tell you that

792
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
We have some commonality

793
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,280
This together and 2nd

794
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
I don't think that's why you are here today

795
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Right

796
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
Otherwise

797
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:47,008
How he highlighted specific policies that represented those parts

798
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,056
I'm selfish economic just

799
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,407
If free education Oregon universities I have two daughters in

800
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
College and I know how much it cost me I know that my wife and I will have to get a second job to be able to pay for them to

801
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Go to college

802
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
So did they decide to support a partner no

803
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Well

804
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
In fact

805
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
Bigot

806
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,559
Eagan Thrift by the Democratic socialists of America

807
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,935
Both the local and National chapters of the organization

808
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Yes

809
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,823
100%

810
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
Because with that endorsement came from real support

811
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:34,623
Cafe seemed like a good conduit locally they committed hundreds of volunteers had

812
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:40,255
5200 power that allowed them to

813
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,071
What the neighborhood

814
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,935
And not on Thousand Oaks

815
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
Trying to convince people to vote

816
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,967
Excited about that I'm feeling good.

817
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,855
And more than just helping them knock on doors because of the national endorsement

818
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:11,743
On many evenings of the week they actually had folks from all over the United States phone back

819
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,583
Calling from places like Florida to Bay Ridge Brooklyn

820
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Again pitching people to vote for father Elliott

821
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,519
I'm trying to show that my candidacy for City Council

822
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,591
It is for everyone in this District

823
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,687
This is what I find so fascinating about you

824
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:37,343
Did I see such a contradiction and everything you're saying there that you're saying you want to represent the whole Community which I'm sure

825
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Sure you do

826
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,951
But at the heart of it like what's motivating that is wanting to give voice

827
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,255
To this group of people that don't have a voice

828
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,095
Absolutely I mean that that is 100% that I cannot deny.

829
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
What is vemos

830
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:56,287
Motivating factors of me running because I wanted to make sure my commute

831
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,103
City has a voice and has representation but

832
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,919
Running to represent everyone

833
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,783
You know

834
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Because

835
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
You know

836
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,671
Was that a question in your mind going into this like

837
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
How do I walk this

838
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
Probably

839
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Tiny tightrope

840
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Of telling

841
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Deer community

842
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
IMU

843
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
And this is our moment

844
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
But simultaneously

845
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
Hummingbird

846
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
Majority of the neighborhood like

847
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:35,455
But I'm still you to like Dover I can be both people have to understand

848
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
My identity

849
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,551
I mean I went and knocked on thousands of doors

850
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
We we talk to people

851
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
My my

852
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,951
Talking points of the door was always I'm a

853
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
Father for my wife is a school near

854
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
I love this community and I didn't speak on the apartheid open listings

855
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,775
Livability in the community we spoke about transportation we spoke about

856
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,615
A police accountability we spoke about things that people in the community

857
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Embassy Suites

858
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
Yes we are going to support

859
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,783
We need somebody like you who can go and in our behalf

860
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,879
So at the end of the day my identity is

861
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Who I am

862
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
I am running as

863
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Who I am

864
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
And I would not allow anybody to take

865
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
That away from

866
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,935
And so just a couple of days before September 12th before the election

867
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
I checked in with Kayla to see how things were look

868
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,287
How many days do we have left here

869
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
And apparently she told me as Lu team and is canvassers had been going around to all of these doors knocking

870
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
They had been taking notes

871
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,255
In those notes each person was given a number from 1 to 5

872
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Based on

873
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,935
Their level of support one is like that person was so proelia team you didn't even need to go to that door you're just marking them

874
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
5 is like

875
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Sorry I'm voting for somebody else

876
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Twos and ones are positive IDs

877
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,711
I'm just a couple of days before the election an election I'll remind you they only need four thousand votes to win

878
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,271
The number of positive IDs they had was

879
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
5500 so you currently a 5500 give or take

880
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:26,047
Sol Willoughby be interesting to see how the primaries will be translated the numbers when the

881
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
September 12th comes

882
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
Okay well we're going to take a break and when we come back it'll be Election Day election day

883
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
This is Jeffrey this is Marjorie from Boise Idaho Radiolab is supported in part

More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

887
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
I hate everybody

888
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,023
I'm a producer at Radiolab

889
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
And I'm here because I need your help

890
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
On the show

891
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
And I request

892
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
For those of you who

893
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

894
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,847
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

895
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Tiny moments

896
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Brilliant

897
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Basically I want to hear about this

898
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
When a kid you know did something

899
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
It just means you lean back and say

900
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
How do they do that

901
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
Maybe it was the moment that I

902
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,463
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

903
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
To you

904
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
Or maybe the kid was a piano

905
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,887
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

906
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Or maybe the kids in math class

907
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,751
Music in the margin of their geometry

908
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,287
We're interested in the

909
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
Epic moments where

910
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
Kid does something super smart

911
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
It doesn't have anything to do with it

912
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
If you have a story

913
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Go to radiolab.org

914
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Flash brilliance

915
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
And record a short

916
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Audio message

917
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Again that's radiolab.org

918
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Slash brilliant

919
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Thank you so much

920
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
Jay Roberts radio that I'm going to go back to sleep

921
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,431
Okay with what happened

922
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
So the election

923
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:26,111
This is September 12th or 8 so it is 6 in the morning what he 17 is yet to rise

924
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
We are outside the

925
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
OU team

926
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Get out the vote

927
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Here we go

928
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
I got no no

929
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,703
So I show up at 6 in the morning and everything is already abuzz

930
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Scrapy with dozens of volunteers

931
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,799
Staff workers

932
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
If you were coming this morning

933
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,407
Hovering around these plastic folding tables that were

934
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
Set up everywhere

935
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,271
Don't leave without one or two signs so what we going to do

936
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
All right

937
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,159
Sweet and shortly shortly after I got there Kayla

938
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,487
Father Elliott team both arrived

939
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,167
Matching that's pretty awesome

940
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
The memo

941
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:19,359
Yeah right they were in matching Democrat blue Kayla and blue jeans and a blazer father Lut

942
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
Am I in an Oxford with the white

943
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Collar

944
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
Today's election day

945
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
This Is Us

946
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
September 12th

947
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
What is quickly as he arrived

948
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
No opposition insights

949
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
And enjoy yourselves sent out

950
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
To start the day

951
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,839
Beautiful day in the neighborhood

952
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
And so I

953
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
The beautiful day in the neighborhood

954
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,567
We hopped in the car and that was sort of the beginning of the day and really his job was just to shake as many hands with as many people as he could

955
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
Good in as many different disparate parts

956
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Of the Disco

957
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Strict as possible

958
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,223
Are you avoiding today and I'll talk to you speak Arabic or English

959
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
What should be the basis

960
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Of whether or not you win a race

961
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Is ID and

962
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Ideas many positive IDs as you can

963
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Pull out as many of those

964
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
People on Alexa

965
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,535
Pull out meaning pull them to the pole

966
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Broccoli

967
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Get as many of your positive IDs

968
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Out to the polls

969
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
You can't blame for their campaign to do this

970
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
We have two affected we have two different operations

971
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
First and foremost

972
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
Salaam alaikum

973
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
We have likely Arabic

974
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
Speakers assumption was

975
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,927
That an Arab voter is going to need their hand held much more tightly

976
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
To get them

977
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
To the polls

978
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,767
Never been to the polls before

979
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
And so they had like six people on their phones just going down these list

980
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
Have you voted today

981
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
Simultaneously that same person who's been called basically the person that actually make sure that you go vote

982
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,527
Being flanked by a group of canvassers

983
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,159
This is a Muhammad marching up to their apartment in banging on their door saying

984
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,535
1 C to e r e d

985
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
4 + 40

986
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,911
Come out and vote we're going to pull you out

987
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
What time are you going to the polls

988
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,151
I need you to go vote father K need you to go look

989
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,967
They had this very

990
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
Long script they would go through

991
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,903
And I don't remember all of the Arabic but they would often say so are you going to the polls today and the responsibility and Shala

992
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,279
I like God willing and they weren't supposed to accept that they'd have to say no no no no no no no

993
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:51,679
Inshallah tomorrow today God willing you willing and then they would have to get them to say either like I

994
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
I promise on my head and I promise on my heart and

995
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:59,615
And if they got either of those then they felt like they had imposed social pressures that would work on the Arab community

996
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
And then on top of all this we have to do the standard operation of get-out-the-vote with the Triple Crown voters which is like

997
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,343
The voters that have that reliably vote in primaries

998
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,647
In this community largely White

999
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,671
Largely over the age of

1000
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
250 St Nicholas

1001
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Old folks home

1002
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727
I am back again nursing homes sending out even more canvassers and even

1003
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,823
Educational shout out the passenger window of your car

1004
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,919
Early on in the day back at the campaign headquarters

1005
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
I need somebody to free

1006
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:46,719
It was clear just how complicated and resource-intensive running these two parallel campaigns what

1007
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
Go to vote

1008
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,935
I just received a call from several Muslim women saying that they needed a ride to the polls

1009
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,239
His wife Grace was going to go pick them up

1010
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
But you needed someone to go with her

1011
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
But you know.

1012
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
If I can leave the table

1013
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
You got it

1014
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,159
Yeah I'll be one of the campaign directors and eat said no you got to stay here

1015
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
I'll take care of this

1016
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Muhammad

1017
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,839
Can it be Muhammad like Justin Muhammad

1018
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
But turns out at Muhammad doesn't speak Arabic

1019
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
Arabic

1020
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:37,407
Eventually turned out to not actually be a problem so why doesn't Muhammad

1021
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
Sogo

1022
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,135
But then we died put it up

1023
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,207
Women

1024
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,279
Would be more appropriate for all those going to pick them up

1025
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
Three women

1026
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
San Marino culture

1027
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,423
Muhammad can be here

1028
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
How to make it take my place for a little bit

1029
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
What do I do

1030
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
Define lie

1031
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
Indeed a hectic

1032
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
They said we. Just go

1033
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
And this was all for just to vote

1034
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
But I will say despite all that Midway through the day it did appear like this two-pronged approach woodworking

1035
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,487
You didn't

1036
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
50 doors

1037
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,607
71 people canvassers we're getting good feedback

1038
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
And on the street

1039
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,447
Dr. Adam

1040
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,239
Airboats

1041
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,031
And hello

1042
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
White folks were coming up to and saying like

1043
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
We voted for you

1044
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:49,855
Pomeranian teamholiday with the campaign from the beginning

1045
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
You understand what this means for the American community

1046
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
You only know what it means

1047
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Pretty personal

1048
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Are you going to say

1049
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
Really emotional I don't want to be voice in the loop

1050
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
My husband is dad in Malaysia

1051
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Because you send me a man

1052
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Okay Kendall

1053
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Thank you.

1054
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Public voting

1055
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Thank you

1056
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
It is very personal

1057
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
But then

1058
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
Hi how are you

1059
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,887
In LED in car at about 2 in the afternoon

1060
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
How's the numbers looking

1061
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,751
They got their first sense of what voter turnout was looking like

1062
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Right

1063
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
So they never said that we're

1064
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
Underperforming in a few poll sites

1065
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
You should be doing better

1066
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Yeah

1067
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Sorry

1068
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,799
This is Muhammad Khan the campaign treasurer

1069
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
Yeah they never said that

1070
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,639
You know post I swear we have

1071
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Strong support

1072
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Are showing lower

1073
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Turn out the way

1074
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
So I can see what I know who people are voting

1075
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Informant we're guessing

1076
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,903
Since less people are voting their overall that means

1077
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Lymphocytes where are we now

1078
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Our opponent has trunks

1079
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Support

1080
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,167
And so what what are the strategies to remedy that

1081
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
So is need to allocate more again

1082
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
Areas where we see

1083
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Thunder performance

1084
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
Turn more people

1085
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
To go knock on the

1086
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Knock on the doors

1087
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,735
Old people out of their homes

1088
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
Make sure they vote

1089
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,111
And so with about 4 hours remaining

1090
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,951
The right now is all about talking to individuals Dragon people off the street

1091
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:07,839
All of the leaders of the campaign including Linda sarsour

1092
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,935
Barber shops

1093
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,799
They were literally going into arab-owned stores

1094
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:23,199
Barbershops delhi's hookah lounges

1095
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,551
Google

1096
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,975
And what was happening of the final push

1097
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,767
Volunteers were showing up

1098
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:42,143
It's a good time to push again

1099
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,847
Liverpool sites that have been hit at 115

1100
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Seem to be working

1101
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
So we just got to keep that up

1102
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
What what what what's the what's the emotion of the moment

1103
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,343
Yeah I don't know I mean it's a closed right there like if I eat it feels like it

1104
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,487
Based on the turnout numbers that were seeing in the way that turn out happening there's basically two strongholds that are currently developing

1105
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,535
North Bay ridge ave Bay Ridge

1106
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,607
South Bay Ridge which is largely White

1107
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,935
Seems to be turning out hard for the establishment candidate just

1108
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:21,055
And Brandon in North Bay Ridge is where the majority of the arab-american

1109
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,895
And in that moment the campaign makes a decision

1110
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,479
So at this point we're zeroing in all of our efforts on just

1111
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
Everything North

1112
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
75th Street

1113
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,367
That the only way to win

1114
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,767
Is the push hard to get as many votes as they can in those Arab American neighborhoods and essentially

1115
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,071
Write off trying to convince the white

1116
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:48,191
So this is like you know we got it it's our people are going to make the difference so we go for our people

1117
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Yes

1118
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
We're doing good

1119
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,127
Inside like an hour remaining

1120
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Everyone went out

1121
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
For one final push

1122
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
Lock.

1123
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
And I'll see it when I come back

1124
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,023
Cars were driving by honking their horns for him

1125
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
Brooklyn

1126
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Just broke the 12 hour shift

1127
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
Hey thank you so much

1128
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
Thank you so much brother

1129
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,903
Can you take a picture of us

1130
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
By my watch it is 9

1131
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
The campaign is over

1132
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,391
I was with eliaquim right when we hit 9

1133
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
And in that moment

1134
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,767
I don't know from where but someone handed him

1135
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
What's up baby

1136
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
An infant

1137
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
And he was just

1138
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
Standing on this dark

1139
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Street

1140
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,959
His back against the minivan

1141
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
His face illuminated by the Light

1142
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,567
Pouring out from his campaign headquarters

1143
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,639
With this baby in one arm

1144
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,711
And his cell phone pressed tightly up against his ear

1145
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
Asking Kayla

1146
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
What the numbers were looking like

1147
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,071
All of these volunteers staff and supporters

1148
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,911
We're gathering in the patio of this bar Pizzeria called the Firefly

1149
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
Waiting there for eliaquim to arrive

1150
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
As well as the results

1151
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
Kayla called me as I was walking up to the fire

1152
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Fly pizzeria

1153
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,735
Because of that time the numbers from South Brooklyn came in

1154
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:13,599
She said I've added these results with what we already know and she said the

1155
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Willis

1156
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,351
The moment before I walked into

1157
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
Biloxi weather

1158
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
The Firefly

1159
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:57,375
After word got around that they had in fact lost on Linda sarsour

1160
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Stood up on this picnic table

1161
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,727
And addressed everyone

1162
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,799
I know a lot of folks were here who are not

1163
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,895
Children immigrants or if you're not arab-american or Muslim you do not under

1164
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Understand what

1165
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
It is not over

1166
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
And I want to see the father

1167
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
Father, did not have to do

1168
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
He did not have to

1169
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
Quit his job

1170
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
A father of four

1171
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,839
But father I just did it

1172
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:32,703
He did it to help us build the political voice that we knew we always had

1173
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
In this community to allow people to pay attention to us and our issues

1174
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,431
The weather tonight we're doing this again

1175
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,095
But we lost it

1176
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:05,727
Gwinnett to they know why we ended up losing by just under 700 votes

1177
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,543
Which is about 7% of the total vote

1178
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,687
Cast we know what what what would account for the difference

1179
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
Because the voter records don't come out until December but there are a couple things that we do know one

1180
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,927
Was that the Renault Arabic translators at the polls

1181
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
Really

1182
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Yeah

1183
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,375
See how far I can get I'm just follow we actually had reporters sarkari go down into one of the polling

1184
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
To see exactly what was going on

1185
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,495
Hi can I just ask what languages you guys are translating

1186
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
Cantonese and Mandarin

1187
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
How about you

1188
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
Cantonese

1189
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
Spanish

1190
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
English to Spanish

1191
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,967
Okay is there somebody in Arabic translator

1192
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,271
Portugal Arabic is not a

1193
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
Approved the language

1194
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
4 in

1195
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
Driving trip

1196
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Acting New York

1197
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
Turns out

1198
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,791
What languages are provided in any borough of New York City

1199
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Are decided upon

1200
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
Based on census

1201
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:11,775
And because there is no census data, that may be so angry

1202
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,335
You can't come here like who they are they just have

1203
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Go neutral

1204
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:20,991
What the problem was the interpreters that the campaign was attempting to provide for these folks

1205
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,319
At several of the polling locations they were actually turned away from the

1206
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:29,183
Play New York state official by the election people by the folks working the polls

1207
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
Relay

1208
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,511
Which is which it turns out is illegal

1209
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,303
They were illegally turned away

1210
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
They were illegally turned away

1211
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
But

1212
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:42,495
Despite all that they did in fact get out more arab-american voters than have

1213
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
Ever turned out

1214
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
For a Raceway

1215
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
It's like by

1216
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,407
Factor of 404

1217
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
Where they ended up

1218
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
Coming up short it would seem

1219
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Is with the white photo

1220
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,599
And nobody has a perfect explanation

1221
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:02,719
But I did talk to some political movers and shakers down in the area and they they offer.

1222
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
Three different explanations

1223
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,607
When is that the message that he was delivering to the white folks to fail

1224
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
How to connect

1225
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
The second one is that

1226
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,823
Having these two campaigns at the same time one for the Arabs one for the white folks that that just damn damn from the beginning II recovery

1227
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
All of it either

1228
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
IMM the third one is that

1229
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
This had nothing to do with him

1230
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,783
The fat nothing to do with this campaign

1231
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,927
Just In This Moment there were not enough white folks who would be willing to vote for in Arab candidate

1232
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
No matter what

1233
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
No it's nice to

1234
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
We're emotionally where are you

1235
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
Are you are you

1236
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
Do you like cotton

1237
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,151
A couple weeks after the election I headed back down to Bayridge to sit down

1238
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,455
One more time with Father Lut

1239
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,039
Well of a truth is that I haven't taken a day off yet

1240
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
You cuz I've been so busy

1241
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,975
I'm not doing this to myself it is just

1242
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,255
The outcome of the

1243
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,535
Just convince husband

1244
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
Unbelievable

1245
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,119
So the moment we finished with the campaign week

1246
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
Continue to meet

1247
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
The discus

1248
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,959
The boutique aboard that we have built

1249
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,751
What the weather going to do with it

1250
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,335
Because we have almost three thousand people came out and voted

1251
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,639
We can make a difference in any election

1252
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:31,551
And that's why I said we cannot slow down now we need to continue to educate the community we need to continue to be engaged

1253
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
It's within we cannot oppose government

1254
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
We cannot

1255
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,159
Afford to lose the momentum

1256
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
We just can't

1257
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
So this is

1258
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
Are you a politician now like is that what

1259
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
This is the will of the community

1260
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
We have demands

1261
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
We have

1262
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Political power

1263
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:50,751
And then we have an address now and the address is Heather Elliott

1264
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,823
Also elected officials

1265
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
You would have talked to us

1266
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,151
You come and speak to us through Heather Elliott

1267
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
That's the only way you can talk

1268
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:08,927
Wow yeah I I feel like what struck me in that conversation

1269
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,023
Would like he spent his entire campaign

1270
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Trying to

1271
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Speak to

1272
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
All sorts of different crew

1273
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,143
She was saying I can represent you all

1274
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
I am your everyone

1275
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,983
But in that final conversation

1276
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,543
What I heard from him in that was

1277
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,871
Can becoming more and more of a voice of just

1278
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,151
One group

1279
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
One community

1280
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
His command

1281
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
Mut yeah

1282
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
But I said

1283
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
Cut you know this is the game

1284
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,415
I feel like this is him recognizing the nature of the game and

1285
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Deciding to come from a position of strength

1286
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,023
I say also I'm also you want him to

1287
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
Basically

1288
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,911
Tighten his grip on the Arrow vote and then walk in the room after lumiquest next AC

1289
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:54,495
When you want it our votes deal with me I've got votes

1290
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,799
The push I've got votes to give and withhold

1291
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,615
What I want I want that community

1292
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
To step out

1293
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
And be heard

1294
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
Have a voice

1295
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
And this is how it has

1296
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
I think it has two

1297
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,807
If you believe in this system it has

1298
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
To be possible

1299
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
If someone talented enough

1300
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
To be able to stand up

1301
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
Say two things at

1302
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:13,951
At the same time

1303
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,767
Two things seem contradictory but he does believe in

1304
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
It has to be possible

1305
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,655
Yeah I understand that but I mean in this particular moment in this pretty good I mean

1306
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,191
I don't think identity politics

1307
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
The choice

1308
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
Yeah I mean you remember the woman who's like

1309
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Stele egyptian

1310
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Stele egyptian

1311
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,615
He's being seen

1312
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:37,247
That's one thing that he is not what are you doing

1313
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,807
Just like pretend to have a Rainbow Coalition when there's no

1314
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,855
Chances that you just want to fight

1315
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,671
You got that out of your system

1316
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,911
So how does he feel about me I was going to say oddly enough

1317
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,495
I tried to put all of this in front of him

1318
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,567
With that

1319
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,919
That brings me actually to the question that I think is at the heart of everything IV

1320
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,991
Is you were really trying to transcend

1321
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,015
Identity politics

1322
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
You were trying to at one time speak to those

1323
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
People in yet

1324
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
At the same time say no.

1325
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
My turban is has nothing to do with

1326
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
You trying to do both

1327
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
And I think that

1328
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
I worry that that is why it's

1329
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
I don't know

1330
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,103
To think about what you just said but the

1331
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
You know I

1332
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,735
With other as myself as an Arab American Lutheran pastor

1333
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
But I had to take

1334
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,415
Stance on issues that really matter to me and to the things that I am passionate about

1335
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:53,279
But does that mean you're sort of a better person than you are a politician

1336
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,887
I like to see myself like that definitely I mean I

1337
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:02,239
Did I saw it with my team so it was the right thing

1338
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
