00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Chat here so

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,632
Next week

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,704
We're going to launch a new miniseries here on Radiolab

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,776
Molly somebody who

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
If you listen to the show for a while

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Like you know her voice

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,640
You know our Vibes been reporting

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,456
Mostly sign stories here to Radiolab for about 5 years

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,808
She's begun to host the show on occasion

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
And next week

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,184
She's going to start up a month-long series about the

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:36,096
Seemingly ordinary but in truth utterly bizarre and magical and deeply weird and ethically

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
Brought

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
Business of humans making more of themselves

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
No this is a beat that evolved over time

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
And I thought as a Prelude to Molly town

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
Let's play one of the big

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
Foundational stories that got her and all of us thinking about this whole world

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
I'm not sure that we ever spent so much time

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,904
Energy and money frankly reporting a story

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
That's the one you're about to hear

22
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,536
Those of you who have heard this check back in with us in a week for those of you who haven't

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
I think this is actually one of the best things we've ever made

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
In case here it is

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
And next week

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
It's on

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240

Jmj rodheim Robert krulwich

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
Webb's Jacques Webster

32
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
And today we have a

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Nella's birth story

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
We're calling this

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
Birth story because that's

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,896
What it is we're going to tell you about babies who are very recently bought a new one day

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Will turn to their parents and say to them

00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Tell me how I got here

What's my story with my story

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
And the parents in this case

42
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
What's a well

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
That's complicated

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Really

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
It's a collaboration with a a team of reporters in Israel called Israel story

46
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
They are a group of folks who do so

47
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
Long-form reporting and storytelling

48
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
Baby dragon Hebrew for 3 years and they are in the middle of their first

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408

NBA exactly and this is a particular my echo silver and your hymen

52
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
And this Story begins

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
With Maya

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,280
It was party we were all dancing Israeli music in the middle of java

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352

56
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,584
Anyway they're at the party so we were dancing all together and then then

00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,984
How old was omigod maybe it's going to be the list party that I'm in cuz I'm going to be a parent

66
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Endnote

67
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
Only apparently I'm going to be a father for 3

68
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
And then we were like

69
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Oh my God

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
3 babies

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
How's that going to happen

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
It turns out how that was going to happen

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
Is a crazy story involving

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,024
4 countries

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
And hundreds of thousands of dollars

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Antelyes all that

77
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
But we should

78
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Go back a bit

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
The first thing that I saw in Palace is a

80
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Is his ability to be a father

81
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Really yeah

82
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
How so because

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,392
He was a good man you know it was very gentle

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Really in adults

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
The family

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,119
I don't want to describe a tomato

87
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
Every did you see that like on first meeting or was just like four months in

88
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:32,127
Make a rear he's established to work with autistic people in to take notice for every

89
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Find

90
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
Of communication and man

91
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
And I understand other people and to analyze them so

92
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
Remind me immediately after

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
203

94
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
X

95
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
You say okay

96
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
I want children so

97
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,679
Are you interesting I wrote a Manifesto back my future what I want to do what I want to do

98
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
My career is kind of night vision

99
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
And

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,311
I gave it to him and I said this and this is what I want

101
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Define at the bottom place

102
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,015
It was a contract it's like this is what I want if you want to join me

103
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,367
So let's do it until what was your reaction to the

104
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
To the manifesto

105
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
I like it

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
It's look like

107
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Someone new

108
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
1

109
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Future

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,655
If your own parents have any either of your parents have any views about that

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
Think don't do or think so weird

112
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Jack

113
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Suffice to say their families

114
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Did not approve

115
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Especially

116
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
When it came to the idea of them having kid

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
How to have those kids

118
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
That is a quest

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
Basically there are two options if you're a gay couple and you want to have kids

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
There used to be three options at CU Chi my towel from Israel story here is how he Maya laid it out for us optional

121
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,215
Number one which is not as much of an option you could adopt a kid from a third world country

122
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Recess over the last few years what happened is it those third world countries figured out who was adopting their babies and one by

123
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
I want

124
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
The Bandit for gay couple

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Yeah the second option which is becoming very very popular Nizoral is sort of the new family sodas called in Hebrew

126
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,207
Sort of getting together with another woman who wants to be a mother but doesn't have a father

127
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,863
And then they do a joint Parenthood they all live in the same house kind of like divorced parents

128
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
I get along really well

129
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
Before the processing everything is like in the contract tell them you said that earlier

130
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
They try this route

131
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,223
Target in Ephraim one of these friend to where they do the co-parenting

132
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
But then

133
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,599
I spoke with Dad and ask him listen it's very important for me to have a baby of my own

134
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Hey with my sperm

135
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
And I said to him

136
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
I want to try but I don't carry

137
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
In the end we have only one baby

138
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
In your sperms

139
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
It will be my baby

140
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
The same

141
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
I think I was more stubborn

142
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
Amir could really explain why it was so important to him just

143
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
That was important

144
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199
But reflecting on it later Maya from Israel story put it this way

145
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,783
It's very Jewish and Israeli I mean

146
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Fisher nuts

147
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,391
In the Israeli mainstream if you're gay or if you are different

148
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
And you'll have your own baby

149
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,279
It's like a signature of being part of the game

150
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
You know whatever the reasons Amir and tal talked it over

151
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
And then they went back to the swim until

152
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
Offered to do the co-parenting and we ask her if she can obligate us to bring

153
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Two children one of them

154
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
House burns in one of my own

155
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Indian she said

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
No

157
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
At this point a year ago

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
So then we decided that maybe the best

159
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
Option will be option three is

160
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Is surrogacy

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,535
Of course if you're gay man that you take your sperm

162
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Take some extra woman

163
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
But your sperm in those eggs into the womb of a second woman

164
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Who carries a babysitter

165
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
But surrogacy is

166
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
Illegal in Israel

167
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
Industrial if you're a hetero couple you can use as really Woman as a

168
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
If you're gay

169
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,503
You can't so there's a big problem but that problem also creates a big demand

170
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
As you can imagine

171
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Are quite a lot of

172
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Gay couples in Israel

173
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
And soda companies

174
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
Spring up basically offering International brokering of

175
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
Sperm eggs in the ovaries

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
Babies Outsourcing

177
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
You can see this play out every year at these conferences in Israel conferences where they get perspective parents together

178
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
We are here for the first time in Tel Aviv big room of people said amen

179
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Chelone

180
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
BC what happened to these conferences is at surrogacy agencies will get up and basically sell their products do we now offer

181
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Surrogacy in

182
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Mexico

183
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
Panama United States

184
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
Ngozi basketball game

185
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
LSU baseball game

186
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
These agencies will find women in all of these places who will serve as a surrogate for your child depending on which

187
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,039
Country you choose whether or not you provide the donor eggs or they do or million other factors

188
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
The cost will vary

189
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
We offer very competitive prices for example $36,000 complete start to finish in Mexico

190
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
38000 in

191
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
Thailand 5085 thousand hundred fifty thousand

192
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
That's excluding the donor of course but we have a good selection of donors

193
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,175
Who is the lawyers you have session with

194
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
Tell him you went to two of these conferences successive years

195
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,855
Coming back from the second one we take a calculator and just

196
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
How we can make

197
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Freezing my honey money way

198
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,071
Yeah they figure if they go with a company that does surrogacy in the US

199
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
$150,000 or is that lawyers

200
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Lawyers

201
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Hospital

202
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Star delivery the egg donor

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
There is a lot of people that we need

204
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
To pay niece's keep my when you pay that money

205
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
You are not guaranteed a baby your by a process

206
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Yeah

207
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
We don't buy baby

208
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
One of our friends did

209
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
This kind of process in five times

210
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
And it still didn't succeed

211
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
5 * yeah

212
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
They figured with that kind of risk

213
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Doing in the US list

214
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Too expensive

215
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Until they started looking at surrogacy agencies

216
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Which operate in India and Nepal

217
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,007
Because over there you can do the same thing and it will cost you about $60,000

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Does almost half price almost a half price yet

219
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Now

220
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,479
What are the things called Lehigh is it in 2013

221
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Basically outlawed surrogacy

222
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
For gay couples I mean you if you can do surrogacy in India

223
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
By the way in the pot also outlawed surrogacy if you are Nepali woman you cannot be a surrogate

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
Period but there's sort of a loophole

225
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
Indian women are allowed to be surrogates in the pilot just Nepali women aren't allowed to be surrogates and if so what ends up happening

226
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
This really strange situation looks like it Basel

227
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
These agents in Northern India will find Indian women

228
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
Move them across the border into Nepal I'll take them all the way to Kathmandu where the surrogacy agencies have

229
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
Set up shelter houses in work with local Hospitals and Clinics

230
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
My sister

231
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Vuitton damier the decision

232
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
To do it this way

233
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Was not easy

234
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
They they had like different opinions.

235
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
Had the bigger issue with the moral

236
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Concept of this process

237
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
It was like

238
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,943
This is the thing that we need to do I want to be a father. How was

239
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
Was very hard for him if it's

240
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
It's immoral to do

241
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Things like that

242
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
To use

243
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Another woman to

244
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Give

245
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Me

246
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Present like that

247
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
And I know she will never

248
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
We'll see

249
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
This baby anymore

250
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
Is it immoral because you're essentially like just

251
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Using a woman's body or

252
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
You can say cuz like he's using

253
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Other people

254
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Bad luck

255
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
For his own good

256
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Yeah she has no choice

257
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
She's not doing it

258
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Out of freedom

259
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,207
She's just doing it for the money and maybe not morally okay that's will

260
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Use this weakness

261
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,375
Tell him you went back and forth on this for months and eventually the argument that won the day

262
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Who is this

263
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
They're going to do it with this agency called Lotus which

264
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
To their understanding

265
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Paid the surrogates

266
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
$12,000

267
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
I mean service racks

268
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
8 in Indian rupees would that be the dollar equivalent

269
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
$12,000 now

270
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
For a rural women in India

271
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
That is a massive sum of money

272
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
They figured this one just helped her survive it will change her life

273
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
She'll be changing their life

274
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
And they'll be changing hers

275
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Maybe this was

276
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Kind of like Alfred

277
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
They get money

278
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
They can change their life they can buy a house

279
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
They can send the

280
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Her children

281
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
School

282
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
A2 line in the University

283
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
When I felt and understand

284
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Would be life changer

285
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
And dates nuts

286
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Today

287
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
Exploited exploiting

288
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Seoul

289
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
I agree

290
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Started the whole process

291
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
One of the main issue was Peak the egg donor

292
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,447
In like who are these women like where do they come from

293
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
They're from the Ukraine that is not a country expected to be thrown into the mix of country is reason

294
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
The eggs are from Eastern Europe are generally because

295
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
That way because they're white so it's like cheap White

296
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
That's quite a phrase

297
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
So you have like a website and you see a lot of pictures of woman and then you need to choose the most

298
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Jewish online

299
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Dating service I think it was the most

300
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
3DS act that I didn't live very long time

301
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Lady

302
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
How did you decide which criteria you wanted an in a donor mom

303
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
The first one was high you wanted someone talk

304
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
Why why was height your first one cuz

305
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
It's more

306
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Is it too late

307
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
When you're high

308
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
Yeah okay then she has distinct eyes

309
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
They showed me a picture

310
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Light brown hair

311
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
She has this nice nose

312
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,335
You know very strange was very uncomfortable to choose

313
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,479
For me it was very

314
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
Improving OU for everything

315
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Eugenics

316
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Now

317
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,535
6 delamere Head Beach one of the baby with their own sperm they told Lotus we would

318
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Like to rent

319
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Who wins

320
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
One of each sperm

321
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,263
To try to use like to surrogate mothers

322
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
50 $60,000 each pregnancy

323
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Again no guarantees

324
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
So

325
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Donamire they give Lotus their sperm a little cups Lotus freezes the sperm send it to a hospital Nepal the Ukrainian woman

326
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
The egg donor has flown to Nepal her eggs are harvested somewhere along the way

327
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
2 North Indian women are moved across the border into Nepal

328
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,655
Finally the doctors that Nepali Hospital take these really sperm injected into the Ukrainian eggs grits and embryos end

329
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Implanted embryos

330

In the rooms

It was very

362
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Crazy day

363
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,399
And then Gill is going to talk as friends who was also in Nepal for surrogacy to commit to the hospital

I was shocked

366
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Because

00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759

00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,087
So tiny Gilly was 3.8 lb

369
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
His brother Duvall 4.8

370
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Enzyme

371
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
I was very

372
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Cat

373
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
To touch

374
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
He says he expected the twins to stay in the hospital for a month

375
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
But the nurses

376
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
We're like

377
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Tomorrow

378
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
I thought I don't have enough time to think cuz I understand tomorrow I need to take them home and to be alone

379
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
And I never

380
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Take care of

381
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Beanie Babies

382
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
So

383
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
IAC

384
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
I said to the nurses

385
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Teach me how to feed them

386
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
And after 3 days I took them home

387
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
So where was the

388
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
Surrogate during these days when she at the hospital I think she was in.

389
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Because she had the

390
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
A cesarean

391
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Surgery I was asked

392
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
If she's okay if she needs something

393
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,991
They said you cannot see air

394
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
Until she signed all the papers

395
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
And then

396
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
You can see her

397
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
The papers have been signed because she's giving up all her

398
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
Paternal rights and if she doesn't want to sign on

399
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,007
This paper but we can lose the baby

400
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,591
Crazily complicated but basically they needed Israel India and Nepal

401
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
To all recognize that they were the uncontested

402
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Hanging in the air

403
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,343
As a recent case in Thailand

404
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
After baby is born

405
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Changed her mind

406
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,511
Lake and his Husband believe the surrogate decided to try and keep the baby

407
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
Because she found out they were gay

408
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
We had a little bit of anxiety let's say they will

409
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Going to know

410
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
But the baby is going to grow

411
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
In the house with two dads

412
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Unicase tall is in the Paul with the twins

413
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Amir is back in Tel Aviv

414
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
Couple weeks go by and then

415
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Tyler called me and said that my dad the second circuit

416
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
1 baby

417
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
And day after

418
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Dual Istanbul

419
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Plane from symbol

420
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
And then it was very very very nice that we went

421
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,639
Play with the babies would like no parents no friends no phone on falling

422
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
Snow world to visit first

423
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Block Survivor

424
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Relationship with the babies

425
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,559
For the next month they lived in an apartment in Nepal

426
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,119
Just them and their three babies

427
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Learning to be dads

428
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Waiting for the paperwork to be done

429
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,599
Now the paperwork incidentally is a beast

430
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Because after the surrogate sign away their rights

431
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Babies have no nationality

432
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Then there's suddenly illegal in the country

433
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
The guys have to

434
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
Take a DNA test send it to Israel

435
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,472
Verify then they got to get a passport for the baby's then several sets of visas need to

436
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Begotten

437
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
A doll that means

438
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Multiple trips

439
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
To the Israeli m

440
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
And it was on one of those trips

441
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Did they learn

442
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
It was really weird because we went over there with our

443
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Kids together Park

444
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
And over there

445
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
There was another ceragon from a different agency

446
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
An Indian woman and standing next to her was an Israeli woman who happened to speak Hindi and we just so you know

447
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Curiosity we

448
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
Ask her to ask

449
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
The surrogate in Hindu

450
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
How much is she's getting

451
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
For the whole process

452
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,224
But the service was very shyness not very delighted to speak about the money

453
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Which made them even more Curious so they persist

454
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
And then we discovered that

455
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
She gets only 3000 to your soul or something like that

456
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
$3,000 for the whole pregnancy was like

457
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
$12,500 supposed to go to the surrogate that was at least as understanding

458
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
This was a different woman from a different agency in this was just one woman's account but still

459
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,808
In your narrative you describe that you thought that the reason that this was

460
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Okay

461
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Need to do the surrogacy is

462
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,184
Because you were afraid uses this would make a

463
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,536
Changing the life of the woman that was a life-changing sum of money

464
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,400
Timaeus as they walked away from that meeting wondering if they should do something in Israel

465
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,752
Call the agency at the very least say hey we heard some rumors I'm sure they're not true but what do you

466
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
We started to ask question but then

467
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
Literally the next day

468
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:22,112
Orinda scenes of death and destruction from Nepal today after a powerful earthquake that started outside plug mongoose

469
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
The death toll is now over 5,800 nearly fourteen thousand were injured

470
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
Officials say it is the most destructive earthquake to hit Nepal

471
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
In more than 80 year

472
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
My said she was in New York in a meeting and she gets his voice mail from tile

473
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
Shouting an earthquake that happened

474
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,912
And here we save the babies and we got down to the street where half-naked we don't know what to do and he's cry

475
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,008
Crying over there and then

476
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Suddenly

477
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Stop

478
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
The heroes

479
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
The connection

480
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
It was

481
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
Like 12 hours with no connection to them

482
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
We didn't know if they're alive or not

483
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
You know everything was

484
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
Unknown I don't know how but that'll

485
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
Buche cell phone and we just ran Barefoot as they ran out of the apartment down the street half name

486
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Naked holding the babies

487
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
And the phone

488
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,336
On the way they ran into their friend Gail who had four babies and other couples with two babies

489
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,664
We are in this street and we already

490
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
And 9 babies

491
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,856
They actually got a video on Todd's phone you see tall only in shorts

492
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,000
A bunch of other couples holding babies and they're all literally standing

493
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
On a pile of rubble

494
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Has her standing there a guy with a badge walks by

495
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Your policeman

496
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
You're from the American embassy

497
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Where is Riley citizen

498
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
We have here

499
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
9 babies

500
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
We need help

501
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Please we don't get food for the baby

502
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
Thank you

503
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
Thank you

504
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
So they took us into the embassy

505
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,864
The US Embassy or the

506
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
They went to the Israeli Embassy

507
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,288
And Israeli Embassy sort of went into emergency mode gave us some blankets

508
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
And they put up put out tents

509
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
And shortly after the news cameras arrive

510
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:59,552
How tall is the tallest he's like in the median cop because he's there he's going to sign language

511
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Translator

512
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm so he realized that he doesn't have any way of communicating back home that he's alive see if I says tell shoved his way

513
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Wait for the one

514
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
Television cameras

515
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Started signing

516
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,728
12 hours after the the earthquake by so she got a call from a partner back to Tel Aviv and she said

517
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
They're on the news now

518
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
I can see child speaking sign language to his parents saying everything is okay there alive

519
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
Free baby star with them

520
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,320
And are waiting to the rescue team to come and take

521
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
Melissa cameras also captured

522
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
Was the scene

523
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Hadn't really been grass

524
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:45,120
Go this whole thing has been going on kind of quietly now you have an international earthquake

525
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Everybody's watching the television and in the middle of the story they're like 10 Israeli babies and gay people and

526
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,384
How many

527
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
24

528
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
Whoa cuz there is another agency that also

529
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Babies

530
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Yes

531
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,280
Moving from Nepal to Israel

532
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
Maya says when the images of those 24 babies Splash docker

533
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:26,080
Cross Israeli TV screens

534
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
In these ready media search way she broke out one side of the argument was okay we are

535
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
Using women and it's 6 on Morrell in from the other hand there was like okay nice ready for

536
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Are gay couples they don't have a lot of choices

537
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
Evan was asking what do we do with all these babies

538
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,376
And a surrogate's there was like a huge argument in the Israeli media

539
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,776
About the questions of there are women that are waiting to to give birth and we need to bring them to Israel

540
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
Give birth here cause the father is are here

541
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
So they would fly the women to Israel have the baby and then slide them back

542
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
But I do know I think that's legally

543
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
They could not do that

544
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,392
Because that just it feels like kidnapping a lady

545
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,744
And so it went what happened was it very quickly Israel sent over

546
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,328
Search and rescue and Medical Aid delegation

547
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
And all the babies

548
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,704
And their parents they were basically just all put on a plane

549
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,800
Instead of the process was expedited and they just brought everybody over to Israel

550
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Back in Israel a parade of newborns

551
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
It will celebrate together

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
Knowing the medical stress they've been through

553
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
Very much aware that many in Nepal

554
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Are still going through it

555
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
So what happened to the surrogates

556
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
Any idea they check

557
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
With the agency what is the situation with the surrogate mothers and the answer was that

558
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
Two of them are Becky Mindy already

559
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
And they weren't there

560
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
India earthquake

561
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,984
And what about all the circuits were in the Paul but hadn't given birth yet

562
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,568
Yeah I mean about them there's a big question I mean

563
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
No one knows

564
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
They were like a worried fathers in Israel

565
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,040
All my thoughts and my prayers are for the surrogate mother and

566
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
For The Unborn Child

567
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Tell him you made it

568
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
Backed Israel with their babies

569
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Define but

570
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
There is still a lot of

571
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
Have you guys

572
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
I would still be wondering after all

573
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,912
These both of these women gave you as you point out a remarkable gift

574
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
Both of you believe that

575
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
You hope

576
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Both of you hope that

577
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
That gift was well rewarded

578
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Was life changing

579
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
But both of you don't know

580
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
At this point

581
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Just a little suspicious that maybe it wasn't

582
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
I don't know you have this funny feeling you need to

583
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Find out whether they got paid what you

584
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,024
Thought you'd paid them yes like this is why we're so glad that we made the connection with you guys

585
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
I said we heard that you can

586
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Finding Maybe

587
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
So

588
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
We started

589
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Kind of a whole new Legos

590
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Hello can you hear me

591
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
Oh I hear some other things too actually it might just be static on the line but it kind of sound

592
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
The ocean

593
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Switch off the fan

594
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Give me a sec

595
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,720
A producer Molly Webster was able to track down a reporter and Indian the luncheon of bomac

596
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,256
And she asked her if she could

597
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Find a surrogate

598
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,168
It's okay so you're giving me a name right

599
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,728
I actually called that person in Nepal

600
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,384
Location of the clinic doctor and she said that yes I will

601
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Touch with one of the surrogate

602
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
And the next morning we supposed to touch base again

603
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,064
But then again she just totally went in communicating

604
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,696
That's been the same day I open my mail and there was a mail from Israeli no Adam asking me like

605
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,256
Just like to stop the search for some time

606
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
Yeah I was so near them

607
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:05,472
As far as we understand what happened was it the doctor contacted lotus lotus contact to tell in a mirror saying

608
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,800
Call off the reporters you're putting these women's lives in danger

609
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,616
Someone in their Village sees a reporter hanging around

610
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,712
They'll know those women were surrogates that's not something you circuits want people to know

611
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Stop

612
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,136
Here's up here's my understanding you guys correct me if I'm wrong is that we we had asked someone to looked for them

613
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
And that person got kind of clothes and then word got back to the agency

614
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,024
And that's great some pressure

615
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
Foresta changing

616
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,632
You know that's really what we started staring at right now

617
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
How to respond

618
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
We heard that there was a real threat

619
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
Are there live

620
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
Because of the culture of the society that they live in

621
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
One of them was Muslim

622
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
I don't know if

623
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Is the Muslim societies going to accept

624
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
The fact that she

625
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
Carry the pregnancy to a gay couple

626
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
And to swell

627
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
And two Israelis

628
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Yeah

629
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
That's a very

630
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Very

631
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Weird fairy

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Delicate

633
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Situation

634
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
We don't want anything that

635
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
Met her

636
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,984
The surrogate well I mean we want to tell the story

637
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
We definitely don't want anyone to get

638
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,872
But I do feel like we have an ethical obligation to hear from the women who do this

639
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
If not V specific women in this case then

640
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
People who represent lyrics

641
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
Create candy bar

642
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,112
It would be it would feel wrong for that to be a voice that we don't

643
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
I don't know out

644
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
It's like

645
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,328
It's for us it's it's a we don't want that anybody will contact our surrogate

646
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,936
And if it says that it's not going to be without the story so let's do it because

647
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
It's not worth it for us

648
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Okay understood understood

649
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,824
We won't make any further attempts to contact those to those two

650
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,480
Just so we're all clear I think what I'd like to do is to continue to pursue

651
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,576
People who have been in similar situations but are not in any way connect

652
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Potoo

653
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
Those two women or do you guys

654
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay

655
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,072
I mean again we need to wear what do you make sure that

656
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Hey

657
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Nobody's going to be hurt

658
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Absolutely

659
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
That's where we left things at on a mirror

660
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
And then

661
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
I'm sorry change

662
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
A lot

663
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
Play Radiolab this is Sally cooling from Melbourne Australia by the Alfred P Sloan

666
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,152
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

667
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,272
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting the show

668
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

669
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,744
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

670
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,376
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

671
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,704
It just means you bring back and say whoa

672
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
Maybe it was the moment that I kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

673
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

674
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,272
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

675
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,880
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

676
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
We're interested in the

677
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Epic moments where

678
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,816
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

679
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
If you have a story with us

680
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,752

Hey I'm Jared I'm Rollin I'm Robert krulwich

684
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
Molly Webster Radiolab and we will return now to our collaboration with Israel story producers Maya kosovar and

685
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
U-high my towel

686
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
Story of Tamir and their three babies now

687
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
That's how it started for us

688
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
The story of two guys trying to ask

689
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Kids

690
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
Around the point of the earthquake

691
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
The story really shifted

692
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Attitude for the entire world

693
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,016
Cuz we've been concentrating the tail so far on the father's been with 20

694
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
For some odd

695
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
Babies that's an awful lot of women who have to carry those

696
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Baby so what could they be thinking what is the

697
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
Story about them how are they feeling about this

698
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Transaction

699
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
How much are they getting it will it actually change their life

700
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,400
These are some of the questions we had we gave those questions to Molly

701
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
And she should have ran with

702
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
In the months after the earthquake

703
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
I guess you get to the

704
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
The political situation in Nepal

705
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
Change how everyone started looking at surrogacy change

706
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Once everyone saw these

707
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,784
Pictures of all these babies outside the Israeli Embassy being put on airplanes

708
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Sent back to Israel it just

709
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:13,952
Cracked open his huge debate not just back in Israel but in Nepal and India even internationally

710
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
Basically you had groups coming out and saying like

711
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
You know the feminists were saying this is exploitation and we're just using these women for their wombs and their op-ed articles about should we be

712
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
Be shifting women across borders is it the way you want to do surrogacy

713
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
And then

714
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,080
Turn of the next thing that happens

715
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
Three weeks after we talked to Thailand mirror

716
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
Is that Nepal actually

717
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
Decided to ban circus

718
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Completely

719
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
Completely Straits for both same-sex couples foreign couples local couples and for 4

720
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,512
Nepali women couldn't do it and Indian women tend to come into their borders and do it

721
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
No more surrogacy no more loophole

722
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,144
No more surrogacy normal pulse but then the confusion was that

723
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,264
They banned surrogacy but there were still a pregnant surrogates on the ground

724
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
And so they sort of existed in this

725
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
Gray Zone

726
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,456
And in the midst of that was when we went out to try and find surrogate

727
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,136
In Nepal all the circuits are kept in what are called shelter houses which are just like

728
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
Houses that agencies rent out that have a lot of pregnant women

729
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
Houses like the rumors are that they move the houses

730
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
Further away from the city center

731
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
Attract less attention

732
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
And so what we found Nepali reporter

733
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,200
This beast in Kathmandu article trying to get into one of the shelter houses

734
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
So

735
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
The shelter house is actually quite far from the main city center

736
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,416
Almost half an hour 40 minutes drive from Kathmandu

737
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,816
It's all on a Hilltop because these are the outskirts of Kathmandu where new settlement of just started

738
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
It was actually a

739
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
School building

740
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,824
Which they turned into a shelter because I think the school are left after the earthquake

741
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
The moment I reached the first floor I was so surprised it was very noisy a lot of children playing around

742
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,928
And turns out a lot of women bringing the young children if they're too young to be left alone

743
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Really yeah and how many women were there

744
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
Still around I think 20 or 22 women.

745
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
20 or 22 women on the first floor of this building

746
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
This shelter house is run by another Israeli agency so not Lotus but a different one and we're guessing that

747
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,616
Most of the women were carrying babies for Israeli cup

748
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,736
And it is the women I saw who outside the room or who had their doors open

749
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,808
They seem to be around 32 early 40s

750
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,648
Really the first time I saw I saw the first woman I talked to him

751
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
Arguing

752
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
She was wearing like a mustard color

753
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Sorry

754
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
She had some Bangles all the women had some Bangles in the hands and Mitchell

755
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
She said she was 36 years old

756
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Megabox

757
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
From Kolkata

758
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Bolivia

759
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,968
She has two girls

760
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
Berkeley asked how old are your girls

761
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
She said 8 and 12 so

762
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
How did you get the number

763
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
Never could you ask like why are you doing this

764
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
And the woman said

765
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,840
I'm doing it for them it's because you know we have a lot of

766
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,400
Financial problem my husband deserve

767
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:39,008
Rickshaw driver and we don't make enough and

768
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,848
Tallapoosa bottle made in Delhi

769
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,920
And ultimately she said she had no other way

770
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
To raise money for her daughter

771
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,296
To get married because

772
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
In Hindu weddings

773
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,952
The bride's family pays off the groom in the form of a dowry the plan was to use the money from surrogacy

774
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
For the day

775
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
She's been in Kathmandu for 3 months

776
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
So she was in her first trimester

777
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,704
Have a name a lemon for Cody Astor

778
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Disco guy

779
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,872
Does she know who the baby is for

780
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
She said no

781
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Michelle Elizabeth

782
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
But you knows it's not her

783
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,440
And actually all the women that prakruti talk to her very very clear about this

784
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Cesar Millan

785
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
This is a job

786
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
Weeble wobble

787
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
The second woman I talked to

788
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
30 years old

789
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,448
Also made in Delhi also two daughters

790
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
She looked all dressed up she was already to as issue about Lee somewhere and then I realized her husband is here

791
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Just given birth

792
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:52,224
And she put the job sentiment pretty plainly

793
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
So she said and I'm translating here

794
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,624
Map by Celine Dion I will gladly

795
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,208
I will get the baby from my womb

796
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,584
If I was think this is my baby then how will it work I have two children

797
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,144
I cannot take this child home

798
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
I will have to give

799
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
I have no sadness

800
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
No problem

801
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
Anytime for Kodiak these women are you

802
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,432
Afflicted we have trouble getting the baby up she always got the same answer

803
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
The only said they would happily give away the child

804
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:34,464
If a baby comes out right now I just give it right away and then she laughed

805
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,072
Did you get a sense that these women didn't want it

806
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
Known that they were doing this

807
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
I mean some of them did and some of them didn't

808
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:51,360
Because some women would like to go but now that I'm here my neighbor's my family everyone

809
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,735
And then when Mercury Aster

810
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,551
I have an opinion is it right or wrong

811
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
She answered

812
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,695
No I'm here for the money

813
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,999
I would not listen to any opinion

814
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,047
If it was wrong I would not come here

815
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
But some of them was like why would I tell anyone you know there's one Temecula

816
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,103
32 years old Beijing nail polish on and she had lettuce pink lips

817
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Stick on wallet

818
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:30,783
She said people in my Village simply do not believe these things this week

819
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
The one can have children by getting injected or taking medicine

820
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
They won't believe this

821
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,207
She kind of do badan us with

822
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
How some of the people in a village

823
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
I done something similar when they

824
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
Bred cows or fishes

825
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
You said like maybe they'll understand

826
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,727
But my family would not understand

827
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
She says nude williger

828
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
I have told lies to them

829
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,199
So how much in the end of it do they make

830
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
I asked him how much money do you get here

831
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,047
3.5 lakhs

832
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
What is that mean in dollars

833
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,167
So if you do the conversion today

834
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,239
It's 5300 US dollars

835
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:28,639
And the way it works is that they get paid a small amount of money every month that they're pregnant and then at the end they get a lump sum

836
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:34,271
Prakruti said that for these women at the end of the pregnancy that lump sum is like let's say around

837
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
What's $3,000

838
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,623
Which is the amount that telling me or heard outside the embassy

839
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,695
The total sum that they have when they go back home is quiet

840
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
You know it's not

841
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
A lot

842
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
So $5,000 is

843
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Yeah what's the difference

844
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,751
Tutor to see if this was a number that was just coming out of that shelter house or if it was something that was

845
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,823
Like the going rate I guess

846
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
We talked to

847
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
Sixer gets here in India

848
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:07,807
That same rate around $5,000 kept coming up and we did hear a range from one surrogate in this was about

849
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
A friend of hers

850
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
We heard as low as 1000

851
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
A surrogate getting only $1,000 for pregnancy

852
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Yeah

853
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Hello

854
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Jerusalem calling

855
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
New York answering

856
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,383
Ultimately we took this information back to telling a mirror because

857
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
This was originally there question

858
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
So let's talk about the money partner

859
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Alright so

860
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
The last time we talked to you

861
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
You

862
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
Thought you're paying your surrogates $12,000

863
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
Yes I around if

864
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
We've been off reporting and it seems like the number that's coming up most consistently for what surrogates are reporting

865
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,959
As their rate 5300 US dollars

866
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
What

867
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
It's just too much

868
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Tulo

869
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Really yeah

870
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
I want to cry

871
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,863
We explain to them that if you actually look at the contract the line that looks like it's

872
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Payment Straight Talk

873
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,935
Do the surrogate doesn't actually say this is

874
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
Payment for the surrogate

875
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,263
It says it says payment to surrogacy

876
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Services

877
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
And it's sort of like once you

878
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Adding that second word

879
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
It opens the door to all kinds of things

880
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,991
She's getting less than 1/2

881
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,319
Then it's like

882
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
Felix tacos

883
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
It's okay to get the money

884
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
So who got the money

885
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
That question it hung in the air for a few weeks

886
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
Until

887
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
7 minutes before I go into something

888
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:08,383
Who is the head of lotus which is the agency that town Amir used in Nepal

889
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
She had just

890
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
At the morning I talked to her she had just flown in from Nepal to Israel and I caught her in a car on our way back to the

891
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Where in she's going to fly off to Australia

892
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
After how much do surrogates actually get paid

893
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,255
I can tell you through that I work in India

894
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
2010

895
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Tell you exactly

896
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
How much is

897
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,871
She saying she has no idea and the reason she has no idea

898
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
Is because

899
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,551
She said this and other agencies I spoke to said this is that when you're working on the ground in foreign countries

900
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
Under the Umbrella of surrogacy

901
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:55,487
You are dealing with a lot of middlemen and the Middleman have middlemen and there are submental men

902
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
The people who find women in India who get all the paperwork done who get them to the Border who get them over the Border

903
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Then bring them to jump all

904
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Someone be sending catmandoo gets into the shelter house

905
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
And all those people

906
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,335
They need to get paid

907
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
I truly don't know

908
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
After the agency know how much

909
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,927
Exactly how much goes for her competition for her

910
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,999
I can tell you I was thinking about

911
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
I would feel conflicted

912
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,351
As the head of an agency to be like

913
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:37,215
I think the money is going to some people that I just don't know like

914
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
I think I would niggle at me

915
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,431
Well that's a good thing that you're doing what you're doing

916
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Let me know

917
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Macaron

918
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,319
Look the whole world and say okay

919
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Brighter

920
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,183
I cannot deal with all the problems in the world

921
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
To give him as much

922
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
As possible

923
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
We paid the money

924
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
4

925
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
This woman gets

926
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Life

927
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
And now we understand it

928
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
Not exactly like that

929
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
It's not right

930
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,455
I think we're deep question here underneath after everything is

931
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Is over

932
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Is

933
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
When

934
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,903
When we do a generous thing like we give people families who couldn't have families

935
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,463
But that becomes a business

936
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Is there something about

937
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,095
The business of making a family

938
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
That

939
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Is always going to be a little trouble

940
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
And there are no perfect ways to do this

941
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Or is there

942
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
A way to pull this off in some

943
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
I just don't know

944
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
I mean like

945
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
I still have

946
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
Three more embryos of thyroid

947
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
In the freezer in a file

948
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
I don't know if the next time I would not

949
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
Do the process may be in the states

950
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,143
The US is like an entirely different

951
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,703
Surrogacy seen which were just not going to get into here

952
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,591
The interesting thing that that Donna said and head of another agency

953
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:24,479
Was that they think that in the next like 5 to 10 years the US will be one of the only countries where surrogacy is still happening

954
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Things are closing down

955
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,063
Most of the Stinger closing down

956
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
CIBC Nepal has a band

957
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,927
Thailand it looks like in a few days after this

958
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
Peace comes out that India May banat for foreigners Cambodia there's rumors that they're about to ban it and even

959
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,631
Canada there talks of new restrictions on surrogacy

960
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,983
And this is these are bands like not just for same-sex couples but

961
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
Every single people

962
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
LOL

963
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,175
And the main reason for the all these bands in restrictions as worries about

964
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Explain women

965
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Yeah

966
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
Guy feel weird about

967
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Because kitchen Furyk

968
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
If you're trying to

969
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
If you as we heard these women are making a business

970
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
Decision whether or not we agree with it

971
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
Entirely separate thing they are making it

972
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Decision then we're going to take it away

973
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
In order to

974
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Protect ham fields

975
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
I don't know

976
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,471
Funny cuz it's * it also feels

977
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,823
If you just think like we have these women can decide how they're going to use their own by

978
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
It's a little extra little black divorced

979
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
Totally is

980
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
But by the same token

981
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
It's not wrong for a

982
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Society

983
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Say hey there certain things

984
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
Won't allow we won't give you that choice be

985
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Because we

986
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
We find that the choices

987
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Itself is

988
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
I mean

989
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,607
Spare would like one of the arguments against

990
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Banning it is that

991
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Is that

992
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
They're still

993
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
Demand

994
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
For sure gif

995
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,591
And that that's not going to go away and so it just pushes

996
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,199
Underground underground in so

997
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
And then that way it's a lot

998
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Yeah Shady

999
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
But the other thing was

1000
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,831
Does that then prakruti actually went in

1001
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,927
Talk to the women about life

1002
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
Job does for

1003
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,511
Obtuse about Saigon

1004
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
Like you okay so it's not

1005
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,375
The crazy amount of money we thought it might have been its $5,000

1006
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
What is a24

1007
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,191
Mesut Ozil

1008
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Medicine

1009
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,775
One woman said that you know when I get this money

1010
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:29,151
I'm going to go back home and start something on my order status

1011
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,527
Do you know my own deal Enterprise

1012
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:40,927
All of them wanted to use this money to build a house is it okay

1013
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:47,583
Hey can you buy a plot of land in New Delhi for 5 grand

1014
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
When do they take the money and they go back to their original Village

1015
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
And they use it there to buy a small plot of land that's totally doable and it's actually no small feet

1016
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:03,199
Land is so important in our Societies in South Asia Asia it raises your

1017
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Socioeconomic status

1018
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
It's something is passed down through

1019
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
To generation so you're like creating something

1020
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Thanks for your family

1021
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
And if you're one of the women that maybe already have land the thing you can do with that $5,000 is build a house on it

1022
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
And it's a very small like a mud house

1023
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
Keep in mind like these women

1024
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
Their day jobs are all made

1025
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
It's right and so they make less

1026
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,263
Then $100 a month just said they had it not been for this I mean they would have never

1027
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,079
Probably never owned this much money at

1028
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
At a single chance

1029
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
The more than that like

1030
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
When you go into this

1031
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,527
At least when I went into this the thing that I expect

1032
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
Did you see was like okay

1033
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,623
ATL Airport desperate women that are being forced into this

1034
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
Like right they've been dragged

1035
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Across the border

1036
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,951
I think the thing that I was

1037
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255
Surprised to see when I looked at the transcript

1038
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
Was that

1039
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:56,191
Even though these women don't have a lot of options and yes they are poor they had chosen to do this

1040
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
Out of

1041
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,871
The Limited options that they had they looked at them all and they thought like this is the thing that I'm going to do to get what I want

1042
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,943
It felt like these women were making a choice

1043
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
I asked him

1044
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Bubble level

1045
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,575
What if you're given a chance to go abroad letter Dubai

1046
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Guitar because

1047
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,951
A lot of women from India and Nepal Dakota one of them said that you know.

1048
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
Dubai

1049
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:26,143
Like why would I do that that would be very far away he says that hear the kids can come their husbands can visit

1050
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,447
The FED will

1051
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
The circuits get good medical care of doing the whole 9 months and in for the whole nine months for sending money back home

1052
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,919
There's one less mouth.

1053
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
I think it'll be

1054
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,039
I mean the way we passed judgment you know YouTube

1055
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
Spt on these women but I think

1056
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,159
Babe the very aware of what they're doing

1057
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,255
They might be exposed to do some level like you said but it seemed like

1058
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
The women

1059
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,095
In some ways it there in charge of

1060
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
Deciding how they want their life to be end

1061
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
We don't have

1062
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Duplicate them with

1063
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007

Marshmallow

1065
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,431
The last woman that prakruti spoke to

1066
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,527
Choose a 32 year-old woman from Darjeeling she spoke in Nepali

1067
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
And

1068
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,575
She told boccuti

That's my mama

1070
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
Wikipedia

00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
I came here in March

1072

My Embryo transfer was done once but I don't know if it was due to the earthquake or something else but it didn't get heartbeat

1073
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
And it got washed

1074
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
She said that

1075
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191

Washed

1082
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,295
Surrogate

1083
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
I felt bad

1084
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,767
What to say

1121
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:18,591

All these different things are happening in the story

1125
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
This is also a story about the inventiveness of people

1126
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,255
You mean what do you mean by that I guess what I mean is like

1127
