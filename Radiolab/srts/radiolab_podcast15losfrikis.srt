Everything is going to change

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936

00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,096
In this crazy way that when Louis strass told us about it we almost couldn't believe

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680
So the reason we called up Ladi is that we wanted to hear

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
The backstory of all of this

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
Nqr we didn't have any information

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976

00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Going

193
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,279
A second deal with the American flag

194
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,887
Musically

195
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
How do I do crazy taking you fly

196
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
All you had

197
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The Bible say why

198
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Why on everyone

199
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Outside the building

200
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Silence

201
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Papa was

202
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
It was a weird guy

203
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Tagaytay

204
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
For were you interviewed Papo and some of the other

205
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
And that documentary Papa talks about growing up

206
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
Poor father is an alcoholic

207
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Mother abandonment

208
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,479
The broiler Solana Beach 14 he's in the streets

209
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
And a few years later he makes

210
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Decision

211
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
It's really at the heart of the story

212
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
So that you can understand

213
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Context

214
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
What happened was that

215
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
1989 I think 1990 somewhere around Erica Cuban government is fighting

216
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
In Angola it's backing a leftist Liberation movement and it's kind of a proxy war with the United States

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
And in the ladies

218
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Cuban soldiers

219
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,343
Start coming back home some soldiers from the Cuban army they wearing in Africa

220
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
They came with with HIV

221
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,791
HIV positive because of that the government has

222
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,143
All the people who are tested with HIV virus group you are test

223
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
They went to the

224
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
Do you place a word they went to your bottom and they went to the school that went to

225
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Everybody

226

00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
That's crazy that's crazy

264
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
Heat he knew for sure that when he did that that he

265
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Did that was a death sentence

266
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Porzingis

267
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
He knows

268
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,775
Vladimir is not quite sure that the others that came after Papo

269
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
Really knew what they were New England

270
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,175
But but Papa new remember

271
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Someone say that

272
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Supposed to meaning

273
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
That is a door

274
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
When you don't have any more doors to open death is a door

275
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Coming up

276
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
That door gets wider

277
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Others walkthrough

278
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
At least something besides that something quite the opposite

279
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175

One two one two

289
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Check that's Luis Reyes of radio ambulante is back to his story about Cuba and music in the late eighties and nineties and

290
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Sofara dude

291
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Has made a crazy 2

292
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Dude named Papo

293
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
To inject himself with HIV

294
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Would you call a protest

295
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
I think

296
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Papa would have called it a protest

297
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
The guys that came out

298
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,775
This is at a moment when there was a cultural work happening between the Castro government and anyone had deemed antisocial

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Could include the kids with long hair to listen to rock and was also a moment where if you

300
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
Were found to be hiv-positive in Cuba

301
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
You were forcibly

302
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Quarantine

303
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
So Papa injects himself and he gets

304
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Sent to the Sanitarium

305
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
And can you describe the place like what did he find

306
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Well he found a beautiful place in the middle of the

307
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
Pinar Del Rio Countryside

308
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Full of

309
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Palm trees

310
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Dairy Queen Berry Lush

Any weather

314
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Yes yes I wish I was there

315
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
I was there and there are still

316
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
How far am I

317
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Couple of cows and

318
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Chickens it's it's like

319
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Kind of an idea

320
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
So I went there to visit the last two rockers that still remain in the place your son go away on his way

321
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Honda

322
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
And they're kind of like

323
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
The keepers

324
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Of all that went down in there

325
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
The memory

326
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Couple dates with them and they

327
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
And it's cool like these blue

328
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Housing units

329
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
And you're saying this place is idyllic even back then

330
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Pearson and John are walking through it and they're like okay so we would be walking around here 10 years ago and

331
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
Nirvana would be coming out of here

332
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
NE Bana

NC Symphony

335
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
No kidding

336
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,823
Yeah so it was like Headbangers ball and

337
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,895
How come they were able to have the

338
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,015
That freedom in the sanatorium but not outside initially the sanitarium system

339
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
What's under the military

340
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
And

341
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
It was

342
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
More of a gulag

343
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
But in the late 80s early 90s

344
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
The Sanitarium

345
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Went from

346
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
The military being in charge

347
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
To the ministry of

348
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Health and Medicine

349
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
And

350
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
These were by all accounts

351
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Very Progressive doctors

352
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Are you concerned about their patients

353
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
They gave them all the

354
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Food and medicine they needed

355
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
And they were like

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:54,271
You want to rock how it go ahead and so is like a prison but is also kind of a little bubble of freedom

357
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Yeah

358
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
Strangely enough to be soon found out that

359
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Steven

360
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Had

361
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Power

362
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
How are they didn't have before Larry told me this

363
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Story

364
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Patience is at the sanitarium to go out

365
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Every 21 days

366
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
Four-day trip and some of the freakiest would go out and just buy flashing their ID cards that said they were

367
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
4/8 patients

368
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Movies with leave them alone I remember

369
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Dollar Tree location.

370
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
The boys getting up after sitting

371
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
One of them

372
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Hey

373
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783

And he says the guy

376
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
Took out the blood and waved it

377
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
The police I said

378
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255

379
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
Into me

00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Deep regrets

495
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872

Question that he had done it

501
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,096

507
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
A fervent Christian he's found his community

508
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,904
Of Evangelical Christians that accepts AIDS patients who still taunting the government

509
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,048

566
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,264
Affected say one thing led to another that would be ridiculous but

567
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
Lewis says the back

568
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
When this

569
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,664
Freaky's were streaming into the sanatorium wasn't changing back

570
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
They started

571
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Change precisely

572
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Because of

573
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
100 gestures big and small

574
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,184
He says around Cuba that moment there are all of these tiny mostly silent protest

575
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
Taking hold and then you have the money for NASA

576
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Which was like

577
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
First serious

578
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Civil Disobedience that Castro had in in 94

579
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
The mob

580
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
In Havana Rose upbeat

581
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
If they were so tired of

582
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Power outages Stewart

583
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,152
Angry at their poor living conditions they were leading the the city in raft

584
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
By the thousands by the hundred

585
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
Castro literally had to

586
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Come down to the Cuban La locanda beautiful

587
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,392
Seaside road that circles around Atlanta

588
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
And he literally had

589
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
To talk the mob down

590
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
So at this moment

591
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
The late eighties early nineties

592
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
Justice

593
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Breeding ground of

594
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Discontent

595
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
All over Cuba and I think the

596
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Self

597
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Injector movement

598
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,568
Best crystallization we have a black

599
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
It's like the city of a thousand points

600
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
The blight and this is the brightest point

601
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Right by the darkest Point Franklin

602
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
