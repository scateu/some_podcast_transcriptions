1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,040
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod iron Robert krulwich Radiolab in today

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
Begin on a plane

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Thank you Brooke which carried our newly married producer Tim Howard

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
To the Galapagos

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792
So I took the plane from

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Keto we just finished our honeymoon that morning me and Brooke

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
They make announcements the certain point the flight attendants

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
Open up all of the overhead bins and they walk up and down

13
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
Spraying some sort of insecticide for what for a like invasive

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Whatever bugs might have been stuck on the plane by this point I'm getting super excited

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
And I'm thinking about Darwin

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,048
And I start reading

17
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
Voyage of the beagle his book on this note that I bought

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Trip

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
But then my power supply didn't work in my Nook.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
Come into sight

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
What is the color of the Pacific Ocean

22
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Lookout

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
The plane window

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
This totally wild like I'm nursing like

25
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
This

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Storybook blue green

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,976
Iridescent aquamarine

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
I'm thinking

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Wow

30
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
This is going to be like dropping into another world like nature in its purest form my version was

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
It is my dream of what I would like

32
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
Did you land on and it sort of like

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Lowe's

34
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Grassy knoll

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
An enormous turd comes by

36
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,200
The one that you could sit on the top of and it wouldn't notice that you were there

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
Just going to meet you at the airport just wondering cuz it's very similar to what I was

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Picturing

39
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
But can we take a 40 minute bus ride to Puerto Vallarta

40
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Webster Highway

41
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Where are you are you are you are a Toyota

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
Which turned out to be kind of a big town

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Tons of people live there

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Fishing Village

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Conn's no it's way bigger than a fishing Village

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,152
And just let me say that my first hours in Galapagos were totally different than I was expecting

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
Sort of the first thing that

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
Where the hell am I

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
I

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,744
I'm walking through the town's kind of weight starting to set

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,328
I'm actually walking down Charles Darwin Avenue

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
Just kind of getting the lay of the land

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
When

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
All of a sudden

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
This line of cars comes around the corner

56
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Honking

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Endless honking

58
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
And they're waving flag blue flag the first I didn't know what that was happening but turned out it was an election

59
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,792
And I was just really blown away that this

60
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Continue

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
This procession

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
For like 15 minutes

63
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
And I remember asking one guy

64
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
Who's your candidate in there like

65
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
I didn't know where the guy was but turns out he was the incumbent

66
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
And I'm like

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Is it going to win

68
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
In this guy he doesn't even say anything he just kind of points

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Spypoint

70
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
The car is in front and behind

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
As if like dude

72
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,608
Seriously you see how many of us there are

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
But then it a certain point

74
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
I noticed that one guy

75
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
By himself standing on the sidewalk

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
Wearing a white shirt and jeans he's waving a flag

77
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
But his flag has a different color

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Is why

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
And it's really loud but I go up to him

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
And I yell at him who's your candidate

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
He said

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
I am a candidate

83
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
I'm like what

84
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Are you seriously

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
So his name is Leon need

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Journey apparel

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
For Toyota Center

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
He is a naturalist guide

89
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,655
You actually end up meeting a lot of people employed that way in Galapagos

90
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
And he tells me so outsider

91
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
Political politically speaking he's an outsider

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
And of course I'm wondering why he's standing there by himself waving the flag at this entire parade of people who died

93
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Don't support him at all

94
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
They tells me

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,879
CL memento

96
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
If a party in power now that the front runner

97
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,791
If they get elected

98
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,607
Can I see a dark and uncertain future

99
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Grand Hotel

100
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
More big hotels

101
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
More of these enormous boats more

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
People

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
If things keep going this way

104
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Who's going to stand up for nature

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
This is Radiolab and we are dedicating the entire hour to

106
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
This little set of islands and

107
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
To that question

108
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
As the world is

109
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,767
Filling up with more and more and more people is it inevitable that even the most sacred

110
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
Pristine places on the planet will eventually

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Get swallowed up

112
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
How far are we willing to go

113
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Return to play

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
To what it was

115
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Before we got there

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
And more importantly

117
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Can we

118
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Okay so this is Linda

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
Linda Kao currently the science advisor for Galapagos Conservancy I began my working Galapagos

120
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
In 1981 who first came to study tortoise

121
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Back then

122
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
Galapagos was really isil

123
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
Barely any cars super limited electricity all I remember is having a smile on my face

124
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
All the time

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,983
Because you know as a biologist going to Galapagos is like going to Mecca

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
She said you have islands with massive volcanoes

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
Tree ferns that grow

128
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
In a well above a human's height

129
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Man grows back lava flows in

130
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Pink flamingos

131
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,791
This is Matias Espinosa naturalist guide in the Galapagos like Linda

132
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
He says that when he first got to the Galapagos in the 80s

133
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,679
He couldn't believe that the place was real breasts taken

134
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
You visit an island called

135
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Edina

136
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
First things ISO

137
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Was lava fluid was moving

138
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Is it what's what's going on you know no that's not like 1,000

139
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
See iguanas taking a sunbath

140
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
He said he would go on these Dives

141
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,047
Can you imagine schools of hammerhead sharks.

142
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
508 ended

143
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Passing in front of you

144
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Like tuna

145
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Losartan

146
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
It shows you the power

147
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
Choose yours Revolution

148
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
There is revolutions very strong

149
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Okay so

150
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Quick contacts Galapagos Island cluster island off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific 19

151
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
Bigger island bunch of smaller one

152
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
And this is a place of course where Darwin landed in 1835

153
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
And

154
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
As he went Island to Island

155
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,399
He started noticing that there were all these creatures that were really similar to each other

156
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
But also a little bit different the tortoises had different shells depending on the kind of Island

157
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
I lived on the finches look similar but their beaks were always a little bit different and it's got some thinking what if it isn't the

158
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
The way that everybody always says

159
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
What if God didn't create every single species in the beginning and leave them unchanged what if in life

160
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,999
Is purely change what if everything has been changing all the time

161
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Darwin's bye weeks on Galapagos pushing to develop his theory of evolution and that's also why

162
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,751
When we think of evolution we think of the Galapagos in particular

163
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
We think of two iconic creatures

164
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
The tortoise

165
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
And the fence

166
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,343
Let me start by telling you about the tortoise

167
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
Bright is such a perfect day for

168
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Tortoise hunting

169
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
You're not hunting but looking for

170
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
4th day I was there

171
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
I went to the island of floreana which Darwin visited and they're up in the highlands basically in the

172
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
The middle of this yard oh my God

173
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
33 massive tortoises

174
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
Does clustered together under a tree

175
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Wow that is freaking amazing

176
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:01,183
Describe them what they look like is there such alien-looking creatures there like the size of

177
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Json even know what they're massive

178
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
They look like they would crush you to death

179
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
How many years has it been here for

180
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
They can live for over 150 years

181
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
Is a tortoise trying to get over branch

182
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
Who is that that is a sound of a tortoise breathing

183
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
That's cool

184
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,623
So Linda when she first went to Galapagos to study these tortoises about 30 years ago

185
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
I did a trip where we backpacked around the Caldera

186
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,327
She took a trip to this island called Isabella hike up the side of a volcano and looked at all the tortoise country

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
And it was an impenetrable Forest

188
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
Basically tortoise heaven and what makes it so perf

189
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Pek for tortoises

190
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,895
Is in the dry season in Galapagos

191
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
Comes onto the island

192
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
It rolls over this Forest

193
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
And it

194
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Patches in the branches of the

195
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,439
The water that drips down from the top of the trees down to the ground

196
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
Creating what we called drip

197
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Pools

198
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Which provides

199
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Tortoises with

200
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,447
Water during the dry season and they like to rest in water

201
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
And so they're under the trees you have these Pawn

202
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
With dozens of tortoise domes

203
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Rising out of the water

204
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
So that was my first experience

205
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,527
It was a magical magical area and then

206
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,647
I actually didn't get back there for maybe fifteen years from when I was there the first time

207
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
And when I returned

208
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
That Forest

209
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Was

210
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
100% gone

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
The drip pools were just dry

212
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Dust bowls

213
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,055
There was no shade tortoises with with

214
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Sitting out in the sun oil

215
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
Crowded around a couple of storks that was still there

216
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
This is Carl Campbell I went Valley conservation and I'm based here in the Galapagos Islands Charles actually the guide

217
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
You showed me those tortoise

218
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Time it was just a

219
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
Yeah I was a Barren landscape

220
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Baron Brown

221
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
What happened to the forest

222
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Goats

223
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Goats

224
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
That was definitely not what I thought

225
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
I thought you said people was kind of collaboration

226
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
So here's a story

227
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
Goats were originally sent abroad to the Galapagos probably Pirates and Wireless

228
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
Back in the 1500s

229
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Tony sellers making these days long voyages across the Pacific and Galapagos was the the naijapal

230
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
On the whaling Road

231
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Where

232
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,279
Yeah you come and get fresh water but you also come in and pick up tortoises

233
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Land tortoises

234
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
And yet but to take away several hundred of them often and turn them upside down and I can laugh

235
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Year-and-a-half

236
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
And all the s*** like lying there upside down

237
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Liner upside down

238
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,991
In order to make space for the tortoises The Wailers and Pirates would often take goats that they brought with them

239
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
And throw them onto the island

240
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,855
That way when they're on their way back and sick of eating tortoises

241
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
They could grab those goats

242
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
So Wailers Buccaneers

243
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Introduce goats to Galapagos

244
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Put on islands like Isabella

245
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Which is this Massive Attack

246
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Size of Rhode Island

247
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
The goods were actually penned into just a little part of it

248
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Because there was this black lava rock that ran across the island dreamly rough lava that's extremely

249
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Play difficult to walk

250
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
12 miles of

251
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
So that had acted as a barrier

252
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
Basically with goats on one side tortoises on the other

253
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,647
But according to Linda sometime in the late 1970s

254
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
The goat Scott braids

255
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
We were probably talking just a few goats but

256
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
By the 1990s

257
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Those few goats the population had exploded to about a hundred thousand votes

258
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
And

259
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
If you think of hundred thousand

260
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Eating everything in their path

261
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Every sort of plant

262
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
Even the bark off of trees they destroy the forest

263
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,855
So now they had a dilemma on the one hand

264
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
Tortoises needed help

265
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
On the other hand

266
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
You had all of these goats

267
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,839
I didn't choose to be on the island and it wasn't their fault and the goats that were out there were gorgeous

268
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
You know they had curled horns different colored

269
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Just beautiful animal

270
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
And they been there for 500 years

271
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Some people would concern you with

272
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Goats have their own set of if you will write to be there those arguments came out frequently which car would respond

273
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Yeah we going to let tortoises go extinct

274
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Yeah this thousands of

275
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Islands around the world that have goats on

276
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
These tortoises are only found here so way2go values lie

277
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
And so in 1994

278
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,167
What we called the tortoise Summit in England and that was where we started

279
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
The discussions about what are we going to do

280
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Experts came from all over the world

281
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Linda says we want to get rid of hiccups

282
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,407
And many of them thought we were nuts and then it was impossible

283
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
There's a hundred thousand of them

284
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
So many doubters

285
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,575
Carl says he even heard the idea why don't you put lines

286
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
Yeah they eat in Africa yo why don't you get Lions on that and those yeah really interesting ideas but

287
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
At some point they're going to get hungry and they're going to start eating all the other things that yeah you treasure

288
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
By the occasional terrorist

289
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Mini case after endless

290
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
Planning meeting took 8 years

291
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
I think they come in

292
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Project Isabella

293
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
To the helicopters we use that cool. Indy 500 small helicopter

294
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
Messengers one part single turbo on spotlights this is Frazier

295
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
2004 through 2006 almost every day during that time Fraser would fly over Isabela Island

296
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
Two guys with two Shooters are the sort of the helicopter

297
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
One guy that ran away to join his friends

298
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
Circle reloj

299
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
And then we start picking off the goats

300
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
One by one by one video where you see these packs

301
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Goats

302
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Running for their lives

303
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
And then dropping to the ground

304
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
The last goat or two might

305
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,943
Start of run into a area where it's impossible to reach

306
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,295
And what would those with funnel acacian as close as we could have run on top of the cab

307
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,647
Drop out one of the two shooters that was in the helicopter and he physically go into the cave

308
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Shoe the guy chapped

309
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
Oh shoot them on sight

310
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,863
And then you go on and actually in under year through this aerial attack

311
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
The end of wiping out 90% of the goats on Isabella

312
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
But to give example the nature of his business that's Josh Tomlin he runs an NGO that was involved in Project

313
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
It's relatively easy

314
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
To remove 90% of

315
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Agra population

316
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
Confirm an island but as it become rare and rare there harder and harder to detect to go to become quote

317
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,951
Educated learning that this sound

318
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Mean

319
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,655
So the goat start hiding in the bushes they want Move To Learn to stand under tree holding their breath

320
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
And so you end up flying around in expensive helicopter

321
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Not finding any good

322
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Now the way we deal with that

323
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,663
Interesting when we use a technique called Judas goats

324
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Yeah you disguise

325
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
Initially was Carl suggestion gregarious and like being in groups

326
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
And so

327
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
The technique that we would use was

328
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
You would fire helicopter to fly around 5 to go see kids

329
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Then come back back to Basecamp offload then

330
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
And

331
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
He put a radio collar on

332
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Any thrown back on the island

333
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
And then you wait

334
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
Instinctively that

335
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Longo

336
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
We'll go and find out the gut

337
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Week 2 weeks go by

338
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,463
Fire up the helicopter they get back over the island with his

339
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Little device

340
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
It's a directional antenna

341
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Start tracking the Judas goat

342
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
Till they spotted with some other goats and then

343
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Everyone gets shot

344
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
Except the Judas go

345
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Tell her to go find more friends

346
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
And then

347
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Everyone gets shot

348
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Except the Judas go

349
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
And then you do it again

350
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
Everyone gets shot except the Judas goat

351
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
And

352
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
You do that every two weeks for a year

353
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,631
That is how they go from 90% Go free to 91 to 92 to 93 to 94

354
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
It sounds like having a program on you over and over and over again

355
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,543
It gets worse as a good Judas go

356
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Until

357
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
It gets pregnant

358
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Cuz then it doesn't want to be social anymore

359
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
It goes off and

360
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Has his kid and is very salty

361
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
Which is the last thing you want when you're trying to get goats off Island

362
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,671
So Carl kept mulling this problem what would it take to buy Saline MI

363
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
The the perfect guy

364
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,815
That ideal Judas goat if you will is it got that wood

365
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Search for Andy search for

366
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
And it would never get pregnant

367
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
Soco Campbell figured I'd technique

368
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
Where we could sterilize them in the field got the goat start them in a matter of minutes

369
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Smith's net

370
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
Did you do this

371
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,479
Yeah well I I stood next to call and watch him do it

372
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
And

373
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Call take it one step further

374
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
Any actually

375
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Gave these females

376
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Hormone implants

377
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,559
That's basically put them in the heat for an extended duration normally female goat would be in heat for a couple days

378
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
These females are gopher

379
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Bowling 290 days

380
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,471
And wherever they went they would lure the male goes out of their caves

381
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
So that you know

382
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
All in all over the course of the two-year program we had

383
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
Hundreds of Judas go without using those boots they were able to go from 94% Go free to 96

384
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
7th and 98th NYC when you have only Judas goats mating up with other Judas goats than you

385
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
And say the goats have been eliminated you done

386
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,863
Point they got to at least on Isabella in mid-2006

387
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
This kind of eradication program was Far Beyond

388
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,359
On anything that anyone had ever done anywhere in the world

389
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,319
Because it turns out they were just doing this on Isabela Island

390
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,439
Over the course of about 7 years they eliminate over 250000

391
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
So you you complete that with Isabella

392
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
And

393
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Did it work

394
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
Yeah the results of this way absolutely impressive

395
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Plants re-emerging at trees growing back I didn't really show. Of time and this allowed for those important drip pools

396
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
And tortoises

397
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,855
They basically got their home back

398
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
This is a real thing

399
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Tortoise

400
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Walking around

401
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
Increible

402
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
So they did it they got all the guts

403
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Not all the goats

404
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
The Judas goats

405
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
They kept them around

406
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
That would have shot them first it's out of

407
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Pay for them

408
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
They needed to goats because

409
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Well

410
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
There was a problem

411
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Of people

412
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,192
Because during the 90s these demonstrations started to happen

413
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,080
Demonstrations of outrage violent activity

414
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Constant conflict

415
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,736
To explain

416
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
Villa peschke this is Agustin Lopez longtime fisherman and he told me that the 70s and 80s

417
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,488
All year round

418
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,608
No restrictions and the fisherman started making a killing fishing sea cucumber

419
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Because if there was a huge the man

420
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
But then the national park comes in

421
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Same group that doing the go to radication

422
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
They sell the fisherman there overfishing the sea cucumber they've got to limit their cats in the fishermen are like who are you to tell me

423
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
That I can't feed my family

424
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
So they lash out the March down Charles Darwin Avenue they would come down there

425
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Street

426
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,024
Throwing rocks and sticks and everything in a Shepherd conservation Society

427
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,376
He was their counter for testing and he says that at one point they went after National Park built

428
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
And they were attacking the ranger stations with Molotov cocktails did Road they literally drove the Rangers out

429
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
National Park headquarters and took it over on Isabella they burn down a building kidnap some people including some of my

430
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
My crew

431
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
And they even killed dozens of tortoises

432
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Slitting their throats

433
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
According to some accounts maven hung them

434
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Trees

435
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,864
Not only that but according to Linda those goats couple islands where they've been eliminated Fishman to put them back

436
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Really

437
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Oh yeah

438
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
Until what they decided to do is

439
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Leave the Judas goat on various Islands

440
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
Where they can live out their sterilize days

441
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
Jumping on grass

442
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Sharing War Stories

443
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Until such time

444
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
As it might be needed again

445
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,120
It is the is the war between the greens and the

446
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
The fisherman and such

447
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
Still hot

448
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Difficult

449
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Still

450
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Killing tortoise

451
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
They're not that the fisherman

452
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
They seem to have

453
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Stop

454
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,760
You know taking over National Park and then killing tortoises did a y

455
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
It's a combination of reasons on the one hand

456
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
Fishermen have started to participate in the actual

457
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
Fisheries management more cuz it seems like they realize

458
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
If they're going to keep their livelihood they cancerous

459
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Fish everything out

460
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
But then at the same time the tourism economy has been taking off

461
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,032
And so all of these fishermen they find that it's easier for them to actually survive

462
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
By using their boats

463
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,688
To take tourists around island island so they're all kind of converting over into the tourism economy

464
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Going to take a short break

465
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Radiolab will be back

466
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Check with Bruce rittenour.

467
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
And this hour on Galapagos

468
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Hi

469
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
This is Linda Kyle

470
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Foundation

471
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,824
Information about monat www.org

472
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
And this message

473
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

474
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
And I'm here because I need your help

475
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
And I request

476
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,024
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

477
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,864
Aunts and uncles teachers about what we're calling

478
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
Tiny moments of brilliance

479
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

480
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,592
It just means you bring back and say whoa

481
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
Maybe it was the moment that I

482
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,480
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

483
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
To you

484
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
Or maybe the kid was a piano

485
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,904
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

486
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,768
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

487
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
We're interested in the

488
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
Epic moments where

489
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
A kid does something super smart

490
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
It doesn't have anything to do with it

491
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
If you have a story

492
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264

493
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056

498
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Thank you so much

499
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm Jared I'm running Robert, which is Radiolab in this our honeymoon is over

500
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
This is the place where Darwin began to develop

501
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Theory of evolution and it's

502
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,104
The place a hundred seventy year how many 180 years later where are producer

503
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
Tim Howard landed

504
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Wearing fishnets in a Bad Brains t-shirt

505
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
To find a very different

506
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Landscape then what Darwin saw

507
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,112
We just told you a story about how far humans are willing to go to

508
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Check something this next part

509
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
It's about how far we're willing to go to get something back

510
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
We've already lost

511
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Service store

512
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
A place in a creature to

513
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Do it quote wild state

514
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,984
The story unfolds on 106 most northern islands with else had to get ready

515
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Goats

516
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,848
Called Pinta was a very special place this is James Gibbs

517
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
Professor of conservation biology at the State University of New York

518
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:03,296
It's a one of those islands it's not part of any tourist visitation site so there are no people there

519
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
And

520
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
When you set foot first on Penta you

521
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Immediately sense

522
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Sheer abundance

523
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Puppy insect life

524
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
Hubbard

525
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,032
Problem is on Pinna things were spinning out of control

526
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
Vegetation was growing wild

527
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,944
The forest was getting overgrown with the wrong kind of plan

528
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,320
And the whole ecosystem was just teetering out of balance

529
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
And one of the reasons for this

530
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
According to Linda coyote is that we had an island with no tortoise

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
Because tortoises are are sore like the lawn mower

532
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
You know they they

533
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Plow down vegetation disperse seeds but for centuries they've been hunted by those Wailers and in about ninety

534
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
1806

535
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
The Pinta tortoise

536
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Went

537
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,176
1906 yeah little over a hundred years ago they don't know the exact date

538
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
But then

539
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
One evening in March of 1972

540
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
Santa Cruz Island having dinner with some friends

541
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,656
Yeah I was recently on Pandora Island collecting snails

542
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
And I saw this

543
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
And I thought do you know what you have done

544
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
Livedo tortoises a hundred years

545
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920
He International Park Rangers erase out to Pinta

546
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
And there it was

547
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
This beautiful told us

548
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
One male tortoise

549
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
Maybe 50 years old they weren't sure

550
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
They'd eventually named him

551
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Lonesome George

552
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,024
But at the time the immediate question was other anymore because

553
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,328
If they can find a female for George

554
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Then they could maybe the extinct

555
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
The species

556
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
Like poke around in the areas where we got the one

557
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
And I found

558
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Michelle

559
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
All the female

560
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Hey

561
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Dead animal

562
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
What happened what how had that how had this female tortoise died

563
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
Someone chopped in half

564
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
No it was just

565
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
I felt

566
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Violet

567
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
I want you to borrow someone's gun

568
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
I'm going to chill with us

569
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,912
Everyone hold out hopes for just finding more tortoises back and says it kept going back

570
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
Calming the island sniffing dogs

571
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
But in the end they're just George

572
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
Nothing shifted the focus on now what do we do

573
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
We then went to a wolf volcano

574
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
Island next door and collected two females through females that sort of looks like George but weren't quite the same species

575
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
To see if we could get him to breed

576
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
He never did was an intro

577
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
So they thought

578
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Maybe he needs a pinto

579
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
So Cal course there are no female tortoises on Pinto but they thought you know maybe a zoo somewhere Private Collection has one cuz you really never know

580
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,104
So they called around offered huge cash rewards people sending dozens of tortoises

581
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
But Linda took one look at them and was like

582
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
No no

583
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
No intentes

584
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,552
So then I thought we've got to take matters

585
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Indoor on hands

586
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
Basically what you do is you sit at the back of the tortoise and first you have to get to where they'll allow you

587
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
You to touch them

588
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,072
And eventually you start

589
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:34,240
You know fondling their their legs and Tails and red

590
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Hoping to get them to ejaculate

591
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,384
Plate and petal volunteer working with me her name was favorite grigioni

592
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
She worked with him every other day or so for a few months

593
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
And was never

594
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
We were

595
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
Really starting to get

596
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Kind of

597
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,416
Desperate about options in Jane says anyway it was a paradox

598
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Because on the one hand

599
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
Awesome we have an actual living pinta island tortoise

600
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
But on the other hand

601
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,632
He might have actually been like the worst possible candidate for last

602
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
It was kind he seemed to really like to keep to himself he never really liked other tortoises much he didn't seem to like you

603
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
Humans and maybe that's why he survived he wasn't curious

604
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Jane Says

605
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,272
A lot of tortoises footsteps they raise their heads they come out to see what's going on and then they get whacked

606
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah

607
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
In any case for about 40 years scientists tried everything humanly possible to get Lonesome George to mate with another tortoise today

608
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Resurrect the species

609
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,816
And bring Pinta Island back to its original state

610
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Nothing worth

611
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Until

612
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
One day in July 2008 George turns to the two female tortoises that he had been ignoring

613
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
The year

614
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
And he said

615
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
Inexplicably he just suddenly decides to mate with both of them they eat

616
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:05,120
Play eggs laid in his garage and the scientists are like George guitar hope so

617
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:10,752
Dramatically, but they ultimately were infertile

618
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
Mother

619
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:21,248
Mid eighties they were having a meeting about this that's conservation is Josh Tomlin against a bunch of herpetologists were out there

620
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
There and some Island conservationists and they're talking about what to do Pinta and they can't get Lonesome George

621
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:34,048
Reproduce with sugar hoping to do cuz it make a bill to paint the population and put it on Pinterest

622
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,656
10 so for sure I spoke with

623
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Biology

624
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Cornell University

625
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,824
Said that at this meeting there was one guy who just couldn't take it

626
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
Geese that they're getting more and more and more frustrated

627
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
Linda finally just blurted out

628
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Tortoise

629
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
Quit wasting our time

630
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,464
Because it hissed you this

631
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,280
The single individual was holding up

632
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,352
Is huge conservation opportune intercourse the shock was

633
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
There was a wave went around the room when he said

634
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,752
I recall seeing service second wave as a Spanish translation

635
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
I passed

636
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Around the room

637
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:21,664
Really what that guy was specifically saying was don't be precious the tortoise is a tortoise is a tortoise

638
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Let's just take some tortoises

639
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
From a nearby Island I put them back on pint

640
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,112
But there's a much bigger question here

641
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
Which is basically like what is the right way

642
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
To protect nature now

643
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
People are

644
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Right now

645
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
Throwing gears

646
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Each other

647
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Around what is rice

648
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
Josh says that they're basically two camps right now

649
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,824
On the one side you got this classic like what you might call edin

650
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
Conservation biology

651
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
Is foundation is this idea pristine wilderness

652
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
From the very beginning I think all of us

653
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,624
Other people but but you always have this idea of

654
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Wanting to get it

655
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Back

656
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
To some kind of

657
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,536
Human Condition real human being the operative word

658
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
And if you think about it we all have this we all have this

659
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
This picture of what we want to bring it all back 2

660
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,520
To you know what might be like group Des Plaines just

661
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,640
Covered with Buffalo or maybe the Serengeti desert

662
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,272
Lions and elephants are maybe 10,000 hammerhead sharks but whatever the scene is it just doesn't have any pee

663
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,112
What is carrying that idea those pictures your head even like

664
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Useful anymore it's like so sad but it just seems so unrealistic

665
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,840
Right but I mean at the bigger picture you can make the argument of humans now effect

666
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
Every square meter

667
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Of the Earth

668
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
There's no place no matter how remote would get

669
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,568
You can go to the North Pole it's been affected by human activity

670
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
You can go

671
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
I don't know the depth of the

672
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
Impenetrable

673
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Jungle it's been affected by human activity that's how they dream is she's an environmental law professor at the Berkeley School of Law in

674
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
In California are radically remaking

675
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
The world

676
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
And the question is

677
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
What are responsibilities

678
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,000
Second school of thought

679
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
Which in its most extreme version

680
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Go something like this

681
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,888
We're God we might as well get good at

682
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
And we're going to have to

683
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
Create the zika

684
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Based on

685
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Our best science

686
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
And you could argue we're going to have to get a whole lot better

687
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,040
At making some very very difficult decision

688
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Climate change

689
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
Seems to me

690
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
That's a lot of

691
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Species

692
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
AR

693
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Pretty much

694
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
30% 40% 50

695
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
2% of the species

696
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Now on the planet

697
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Two decades Maybe

698
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Disappearing

699
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,240
If this is what I think it's really tough Quest

700
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Now

701
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
If we can see

702
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
That we can't

703
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Any longer

704
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Save all the

705
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
Then does that put us in the situation of having

706
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
To the side

707
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Which one

708
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Will save in which

709
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Won't and do we have any base

710
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
So you saying that that that the

711
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,768
But let's go back to when it was good

712
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Let's go back to a better time

713
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
That's just

714
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Silly

715
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
I didn't say it was silly

716
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
Impossible

717
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,336
This might not be silly they might not be stupid idea

718
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
But we still might not be

719
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Do them

720
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
Okay so here's a

721
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Applewood

722
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Plaque

723
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
It says

724
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,160
Lonesome George is the last survivor of the dynasty of land tortoises

725
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
And in fact

726
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,072
In 2012 after Decades of trying to get him to

727
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
Debride

728
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
Lonesome George

729
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Dies

730
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Rip

731
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
24th of June 2012

732
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,848
And the Pinta tortoise went extinct

733
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Sedam case-in-point I guess

734
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
No Going Back

735
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Yeah I know that's what I thought

736
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
But then I spoke with this woman

737
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,600
Hello just how did you hear me

738
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
Who kind of scrambled everything up for me

739
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,464
Can I get you to introduce yourself

740
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Yes

741
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
My name is Giselle Acuna

742
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
I am a senior research scientist

743
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,656
Rul University come up with kind of a radical idea

744
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
I call it the Phoenix

745
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:34,336
Here's the backstory in the mid-90s we started in 94 to sell and some books from their Club

746
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,688
National Park they began taking a census of all the tortoises in the

747
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
I have a population of tortoises on all the islands are going to do this big population study so they went Island by Island took a little

748
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
A bit of blood from all these different tortoise

749
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
Is genetic analysis and apply

750
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Found something they never expect

751
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
A group of tortoises

752
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Not on Pinterest

753
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
That had

754
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,448
A lot of pain to DNA remember very clearly.

755
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,848
Somebody already exciting it's like yes look at this

756
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
I was on another

757
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
I was at a

758
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,296
We don't think it was natural to sell it thinks it might have been The Wailers

759
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,952
Neither The Wailers or the Pirates talked about in the 1780s

760
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
Whalers become along grab a bunch of tortoises

761
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,560
Put them on the ship and then they would hunt for whales

762
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,168
Sometimes when they were done in this

763
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
The sherpas

764
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,264
Filled with oil products

765
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,664
They throw a few extra tortoises overboard say a few from pizza maybe those

766
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,784
Tortoises swim with occurrence to that nearby Island set up a little expat community

767
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Started breeding with the local

768
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
That's our working hypothesis

769
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Which brings us to

770
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
Her idea

771
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,424
Do you know on average 50% of your genome comes from your mom and 50% from your dad but

772
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
It's an average

773
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
So just tell it.

774
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:10,848
Just by chance some of these tortoises are going to have a little bit more Pinta DNA from their Pinta ancestors

775
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
And others yes

776
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Those tortoises

777
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,064
And read them together collect them for the Next Generation so you can give a push

778
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,464
Crosses she says if we keep doing that taking the babies with the most Pinta DNA breeding them together

779
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,888
Shirley in for Generations you can have 90% of the painter Gino restored

780
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
Yeah but that's

781
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Four generations of

782
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Which means at least a hundred years

783
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
But

784
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
In the meantime the vegetation on Pinta is growing out of control

785
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
So in 2009 they come up with

786
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Stop Gap

787
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:56,672
You take 39 tortoises raised in captivity and they use them as placeholders

788
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
They sterilize them

789
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
In Pokemon Pinsir

790
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Yeah but these are very

791
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:08,448
Purest Serta Vision Bugatti the lawn mowers

792
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,496
They're not exactly they put them on Pinterest

793
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
And they are just

794
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,128
Chomping away right now they're living out their lives really happily on Pinta

795
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
You know until the originals are ready

796
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,856
Now Linda says in the end you don't actually need to do the full aggressive for Generation breeding thing

797
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
You can just take the best Pinterest

798
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
Tortoises you fine

799
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
And put those on Pinto

800
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
And

801
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
You know over the next

802
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
200000 years

803
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:44,288
They will evolve into a pinta tortoise setup could be a bit different than the past Pinta tortoise because evolution of Mewtwo

804
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Vacation and all that

805
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
Doesn't occur the same

806
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
But eventually

807
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,504
Nature's going to take over

808
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
And they will evolve into tortoises

809
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Is this the way that

810
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,424
Everybody who works in the tortoises thinks about it this kind of

811
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Deep time

812
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
I don't know

813
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
I'm not sure many other people think

814
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
About that

815
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
SWAT Pakistan newspaper that says 72 hours left in the Electoral campaign

816
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,448
And still flying

817
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,544
Everywhere

818
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
Unless

819
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
200000

820
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
But we will be there

821
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Miami weather

822
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,991
Hi this is Emily calling from rainy Vancouver wash

823
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation

824
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,903
And by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

825
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,255
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

826
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,095
More information about Sloane @www.

827
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
Sloan. Org

828
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:56,639
Anjana barad I'm rubber clovehitch this is Radiolab today a whole hour on the Galapagos Islands that place that

829
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Inspired Charles Darwin to create his

830
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
Theory of evolution was basic ingredients

831
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Lots of time

832
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Isolation

833
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
And then

834
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Constant

835
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,927
Darwin didn't consider this

836
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
What if

837
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Connie's Island

838
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,839
Thousands of tourists arrive everyday caring fruits and chocolate

839
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,887
And souvenirs jumping from Island

840
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,495
Now the Galapagos government spends millions of dollars checking all the goods

841
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
Come in and out

842
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Quarantine the one that might have

843
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
Have things that are problem

844
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
But what if

845
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
Simply putting your foot

846
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
On the ground

847
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Can completely

848
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Formal place

849
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
11

850
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Actor-producer Tim Allen

851
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
So I met this woman named Frank Yeager

852
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
Who is like a plant science

853
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
What time the restoration ecologist

854
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Said that Charles Darwin Foundation

855
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
You are in love

856
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,423
We were going to look at these incredible craters called Louis and Melo

857
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,519
And as we were walking along the path

858
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
She's like oh wait look at

859
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,151
Right here she points just the right of the path

860
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Look at this

861
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Species here

862
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,295
Small leafy green thing they call that young 10 in Spanish it is

863
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
In

864
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Santiago

865
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,719
I think in the US they call it the was it the wrench of the white men

866
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
The rent of the white man

867
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,631
What's actually the footprint of the white

868
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
Doesn't matter point is an introduced

869
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
Species is introduced

870
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,519
Found in Europe North Africa

871
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
Shouldn't be here and you have this one

872
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
Here

873
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Pointright next

874
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,943
Call Titus County Jail between green and white lie

875
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,271
Has a terrible common name and then there's I'm not going to say it

876
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Wandering Jew

877
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
Basic houseplant you can buy it at Home Depot

878
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,719
But there it is in the Galapagos along this path

879
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
Just looking to the right and the left

880
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
And then

881
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
She just start counting the number of envy

882
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,935
Species at 1 to 3 as you can see here it's only right next

883
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Set the trial

884
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,823
But not so much for then you'll see that they're only there for this border of about 5

885
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
10 inch along the edge of that hat

886
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Why are you happy because

887
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Like I said what happens is it

888
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Taurus

889
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
They'll be back in their home country they'll be walking around in

890
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,903
Garden or park and it'll be filled with tiny seeds the seeds stick to

891
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
Tissues and suck sense

892
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
Trousers they wear the trousers on the plane and then they wear them when they come here and then people walk and then just

893
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
Distribute

894
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
Who dispersed the seeds along the trail

895
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
Panama City's plants are actually probably harmless

896
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
And you know like you said

897
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Blockers National Park

898
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,919
They spend tons of money tons of time trying to keep invasive out

899
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,735
But fact is there's only so much you can do

900
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
And every once in awhile

901
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
One of these hitchhikers

902
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Slips under the radar

903
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
And just reeks

904
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Havoc

905
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,607
You just grabbed it just like that you just put your hands around

906
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,423
But that's the only possible the first day

907
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,775
So while we were in the highlands of Santa Cruz Frankie took me through the woods

908
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
To meet this guy named Arnold my name is Arnold from the University of Vienna and shortly after

909
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
We walked up

910
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,503
He reach out into this tree and he grabbed the

911
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,319
Tiny little baby Finch right off the branch

912
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
He's adorable he's there

913
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,695
Oh my God he said he he looks a little bit

914
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
Furry almost really tiny vulnerable Fletchling of a warbler Finch

915
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
The Darwin finches

916
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,935
Nexium pulsing kind of a deep breathing

917
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Soap Darwin's finches

918
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Ensure

919
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
Darwin when he visited Galapagos

920
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
He collected a lot of specimens of finches

921
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Took them back to England

922
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
And eventually he realized that

923
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:49,855
The beaks had all adapted they were all little bit different depending on which island to finches lived

924
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
With a B

925
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
A bit adapter to what whatever the food they were eating

926
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
1 Islands

927
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,303
Finches had literally like the beak would be shape sort of a long

928
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,887
And then the next Island it would look almost the same but much shorter

929
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
I just became one of the

930
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
One of the most important pieces of evidence that

931
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
You know when

932
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:14,175
Animals would move from one place to another they would begin to differentiate based on what

933
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
But speaking of beak

934
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
That Finch that Arnold was holding

935
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
The Fred

936
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
Did you see the

937
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
50 Cent

938
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Extremely

939
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Yu-Gi-Oh

940
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
The nostrils

941
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
Have have big holes

942
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,447
I apologized something at gotten inside this little finches Nas

943
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
Drill these holes

944
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,335
And it was not eating the Flesh on the inside of the birds nostril

945
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,455
Scientists first began to see this in 1997 when they started to find nest

946
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Full of dead baby finches

947
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,575
At first nobody had any idea what kind of creature it was so

948
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Baby Jenna frantically studying

949
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:01,535
How to get a bed actually visited one of the main reason

950
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:07,935
Gay. In Congo

951
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
She showed me her laugh

952
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,567
I'm turning by shells and on the shelves are these tiny little plastic cups

953
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
That are filled with

954
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
Vice

955
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
This is the villain

956
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,063
Paris is solo concerto

957
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
People the most a little black fly looks like every other fly

958
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,975
Is it policy

959
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:37,119
In fact B. Says regular house fly

960
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,935
But it's actually a botfly called

961
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
The Lord has downsy

967
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:57,855
Pelonis actually means but loving that's Charlotte cost into the researcher

968
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:02,207
The Charles Darwin Foundation she says there's actually very little known about the

969
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
The fly

970
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
They're not sure where it came from or quite how it got here but here's what they do now

971
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,447
The adult fly seems to be harmless

972
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
It feeds on flowers and

973
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
We think decomposing fruits

974
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Baby flies

975
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
They're not vegetarian

976
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Chocolate

977
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
And

978
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
What happens is that as soon as I start laying eggs

979
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
On the basis

980
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Set the nest

981
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,183
Sort of underneath the finch a

982
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
Once the eggs hatch

983
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
The eggs hatch

984
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Applies as well in the lobby

985
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,423
Wriggling little larvae will crawl out in the bottom of the nest

986
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
Ulta finches body

987

00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,287
Mega Man 2 the the

989
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,847
Nose isn't

990
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
Baby finches

991
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
And just start eating

992
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,455
You know they're basically

993
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
Feed on the blood of that the baby bed

994
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
How did these

995
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Google

996
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
For my babies

997
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,671
No that's a that's a very specific trip today

998
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,207
Question

999
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
We're still trying to figure that out

1000
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,095
I'm going to assume that it was carbon dioxide carbon dioxide

1001
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
From the breathing

1002
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Yeah

1003
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,079
Box of some of the birds that

1004
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,127
Little bean sonus

1005
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
Licentious

1006
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Oh God

1007
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
It's annoying normal

1008
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
PA.

1009
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Showed me

1010
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,831
This tiny little dead Finch

1011
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,511
Why there's a little hole into the brain of this little Finch

1012
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Oh my God

1013
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,607
Waco and Ariel Espinoza

1014
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
They ate the whole bag of this little Finch

1015
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
How big a problem is it

1016
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,639
Well I talked to one scientist Sonia kleindorfer I'm professor in animal behavior at Flinders University

1017
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,223
Australian researchers recently did a survey of Finch nests

1018
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,295
Four different species on two islands

1019
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
And all research groups found about 95

1020
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
Percent mortality in the nest

1021
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,255
95% of the babies were dead

1022
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Yeah

1023
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:19,167
And Arnold told me that this year small tree finches so far we have only two nest with fledglings

1024
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
And all the others with it

1025
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Switzerland

1026
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:28,127
But even worse so far we found following us on 13 Islands

1027
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
The Flies spreading

1028
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Island to Island

1029
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,783
Is there any primeskill obituary by like are these finches disappearing

1030
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Very fat

1031
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Very slowly

1032
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Depends on the species

1033
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
We have at least

1034
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,463
5 species that are known to be facing extinction

1035
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
And another six

1036
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
In serious decline

1037
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
These five species

1038
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,887
Does that mean that they

1039
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
May go extinct in the next

1040
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
5 years in the next

1041
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
50 years

1042
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
I hope Knoxville

1043
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,151
You know we have the case of the mangrove Finch we have C

1044
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,943
6280 individuals left

1045
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
Wow it's a Race Against Time

1046
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
So

1047
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
For starters

1048
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,791
They put up all these Travis took me aside to show me where the traps are hanging from a tree here

1049
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,119
You see them actually Oliver Santa Cruz is bright yellow trapped

1050
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,423
Una mosca

1051
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,263
And this is to control the fly population

1052
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,823
Millions of drops every few feet to do that business just

1053
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,151
Grab a few flies take them back to the lab and study him

1054
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
So they can learn how to fight him

1055
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,295
Charlotte and beer. Fantasy is at the Flies use a fireman

1056
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
To attract

1057
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,111
Syria

1058
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,903
Fantastical

1059
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
Lovely if we could find something like that

1060
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
Cuz if they could find that chemical

1061
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,327
That love chemical that the Flies use to attract each other they could disrupt it

1062
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Confuse the Flies and screw up their mating

1063
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Another

1064
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
Possibility is

1065
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Sternum inside

1066
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,567
Sterilized male flies and introduce them back into the wild

1067
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Set the female

1068
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
A mates with a stare-off lion obviously

1069
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:12,063
Doesn't produce fertile eggs if they can't make babies a population will crash and in some cases you can

1070
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,927
Successfully eradicated species this is very much like the mosquitoes

Apple podcast

1072
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,303
Ray but here's the problem

1073
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,935
It's a going to release their livemail 5 into the wild they have to be able to raise

1074
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,751
Inclusive a million a billion

1076
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
Guinness your idea

1077
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,919
Trying like crazy showing me all of the alarms that

1078
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,503
Hats today and he talks with me for baby flies it had just hatched

1079
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,087
Chinese little cup

1080
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
But she told me that these for flies

1081
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:54,303
Will probably die because they always die right now we have

1082
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,887
Huge problems trying to refine Wellness in captivity which is ironic

1083
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,911
Given

1084
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,727
You know how abundant disease in the wild

1085
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,287
Philadelphia tourism video

1086
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
When I was there

1087
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,199
Piedad told me that so far they're only successfully raised three three. Flies

1088
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
When you're singing in millions

1089
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
Yeah

1090
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
And meanwhile the finch populations are just getting decimated

1091
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Charlotte says it there

1092
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
Trying to respond

1093
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,999
Ornithologist have started to notice some new Behavior

1094
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Reference in setup

1095
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
Taking the Lafayette to the nostrils of of the baby beds and what we're starting to see if they're beginning to consume them

1096
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
You need to fly larvae

1097
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,615
Yeah which 15 years ago they would never do

1098
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,175
Tried feeding the finches some fly larvae

1099
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,759
If ever there were a look of disgust on a finch face that was it

1100
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,087
I think there's been a change there also seemed baby finches

1101
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
Climbing up over each other

1102
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
Just struggling to get away from the larvae on the bottom of the nest I mean they'll even start standing on the nest room just to avoid being

1103
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,631
But when I asked Charlotte what she makes of all of these changes

1104
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
She said

1105
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,983
I think probably too little too late

1106
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,943
But then someone told me something

1107
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,551
Really surprising very unexpected discovery

1108
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
Takes a couple steps to get there

1109
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,439
Justice ended up back in 2000 she was on floreana island for the first time

1110
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
I started studying Darwin's finches

1111
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
In particular

1112
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Three tree Finch species

1113
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,959
He's too small to medium in the large and we went out and we we set up our Miss Nets and we caught the birds and we measured

1114
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,287
Even though these are our three different

1115
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Species

1116
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
They're actually really hard to tell apart

1117
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Visually

1118
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,455
So she would end up relying on their songs their mating call

1119
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:53,087
Skip do you remember the song types could you whistle them for me yes it's very simple song

1120
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
The small tree Finch goes something like

1121
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,951
2 2 2 2 2 2 2

1122
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
That's a small tree Finch

1123
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
The medium tree finches just a bit

1124
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,167
Slower for the meeting

1125
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
For the Lord

1126
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Teeth

1127
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:19,711
Wow it's like a soprano saxophone and Alto and tenor or something like that

1128
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:26,111
So we we just meet us at the 4 somewhere and we would always quiz each other what's that what's that we all agreed because the calls are really

1129
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Distinct

1130
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
Easy to tell apart but

1131
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,303
The interesting thing was from year to year it got more difficult each time to go into the field

1132
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,399
The song sounded like they were starting to blur together

1133
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:49,407
Then when I showed up after a few years again I was truly even more perplexed

1134
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,967
Should I gather why can't I tell these finches apart

1135
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,367
It was very confusing am I losing my touch but that shouldn't really happened you should actually get better

1136
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
With experience. Worse and that's where I thought all something's changed in the system

1137
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:10,911
I'd like to think of it as a kind of Darwin Finch you know sluicing Adventure

1138
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,727
So when your team rounded up some of the Birds attack

1139
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,775
We collected genetic samples

1140
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:22,175
Got some DNA brought all the stuff into the lab

1141
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
Terrible realization

1142
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,087
That the large tree Finch is now extinct

1143
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Totally gone from guilin

1144
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,231
So you really only had two species

1145
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
Small tree finches and the medium

1146
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,351
And based on that genetic data

1147
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
The

1148
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,655
Small tree finches

1149
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
Not doing great but compared to the medium tree finches they are because of me and proof inches were on

1150
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
On the brink of Extinction

1151
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Like a large

1152
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
But then she sees something

1153
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
Amazing

1154
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
She's a small group of birds

1155
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
Who have mixed up jeans

1156
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Hybrid cluster

1157
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,487
Some jeans from the small tree finches and some from The Medium tree

1158
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,071
What is that mean what it means that these two

1159
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,471
Different finches had started having babies together which should never actually happen because these are totally separate species

1160
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:23,103
That's really the classical definition of a species is like a biological rule

1161
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
About who you're not going to make a baby with

1162
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,735
So they they choose not to breed even if I could

1163
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,135
Troll that boundary I've got my thing over here

1164
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
You got your thing over there

1165
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
But then Along come the Flies

1166
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,791
And all the sudden like over maybe 20 years

1167
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,607
The medium tree finches they start to

1168
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,703
Break their own biggest Rule and they start to mate

1169
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
Outside of their own kind

1170
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,567
Annie's hybrid finches are they doing

1171
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,919
Better against flies well there's there's a couple Cruise it's a maybe

1172
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,479
Yeah for example when you look in the neck

1173
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,015
They seem to have

1174
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,039
Pure parasite

1175
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,391
And they seem to have more babies that survive 15%

1176
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,023
Wow where is the numbers were very small for the medium tree Finch and smaller for the small tree Finch

1177
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,839
Wow I daresay that sounds kind of hopeful

1178
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
It does

1179
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
Yeah no

1180
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,703
The jury is still very much out on what will have

1181
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,519
But if the hybrids do you have

1182
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Disadvantage and if they survive

1183
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,871
We may be witnessing in hyperspeed

1184
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,431
The creation of an entirely new

1185
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
Species

1186
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
Possibly be

1187
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,551
One of the first vertebrates

1188
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,135
Examples of speciation in real time

1189
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
That we can observe

1190
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
So

1191
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
Talking to the story of these finches

1192
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
Is the story of Galapagos

1193
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:00,895
Same exact story The Darwin saw these processes that he described

1194
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
They just never

1195
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
Ever stop

1196
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
It's this

1197
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Unpause

1198
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Ending

1199
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,743
Struggle

1200
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:07,711
Wellness my last night there

1201
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:13,087
I went to meet up with that guy Leonidas was running for mayor I met him at this pizza place

1202
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:19,231
Election that happened the night before and did he win no Bocelli the incumbent one

1203
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,119
So we go outside

1204
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Turns out he speaks in English

1205
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:31,007
So we can we do this interview in English and I'm I'm almost embarrassed that I wanted to

1206
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
To talk to him because I think the food is

1207
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
It's going to be

1208
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,359
So down and out

1209
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,455
Exactly the opposite he was so joyful

1210
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:46,111
That's what I thought you're not sad and he's like friend this is a field

1211
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,975
A for the other three of money behind them and you see their flags all over Santa Cruz

1212
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
I just came in second

1213
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
The guy who wins

1214
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,703
He spent $500,000 I spent what two grand

1215
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Eating

1216
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,799
Avenue a new future for the Galapagos Island

1217
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:11,199
We are ascending we keep keep we have our dreams up

1218
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
The Nature has a boys now

1219
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,343
Brazilian has a voice

1220
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
The penguin everywhere

1221
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:25,023
So something is happening that exactly how we see this interview

1222
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
Pretty certain hour before we close very special thanks to Matthew Judas kiltie

1223
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,415
