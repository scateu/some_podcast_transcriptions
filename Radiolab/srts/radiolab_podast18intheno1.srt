1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:08,192
Are you weightless

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:14,592
You're listening to Radiolab from WNYC

3
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,528
Richest are the beginning how did the series

4
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
I know the ancient history for you already but how did it come about what was the sort of spark for it I remember

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,256
Sing the word know just written down on the page

6
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
And immediately be like

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,608
Oh my God I have so much to say

8
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:42,240
About that word here this is Radiolab

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Today we're going to be airing work from Radio maker Kaitlin Prest

10
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Because we're going to play for you today sent all of us here on quite a journey Caitlin.

11
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
Is a fellow traveler she just released a show through the CBC called the Shadows apparently it involves puppets

12
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
You should definitely check it out but before that she was the host and creator of a podcast called the heart

13
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Here's what happened about a year ago

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
But for five different

15
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
People on my staff

16
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,336
Seemingly all at once were like you've got to hear this series from the heart

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
It was made

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,456
Creamy tube now they're in me to you stop what you're doing

19
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
Listen to the series to four-part thing it's called no

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
I personally

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,160
I've always had a complicated relationship

22
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
With saying no

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
In any context

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
But especially within a sexual context and one of the people in our crew

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
Wanted to make she just said I want to make something

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
About like

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
No like just

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
No

29
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
That when I finally listened to the series

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
I was like

31
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Damn

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
I've never heard anything like this

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Like really and truly

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
And so what we're going to do

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,184
It's kind of construct for you the journey that we went on at soda starts with Caitlin

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Work

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
So today we're going to play you excerpts from

38
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
First series that she produced for the heart

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,632
Then over the next few weeks

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,752
We're going to dive deeper into some of the issues that she raises in her series because like I said

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,128
When I heard it and we started talking about it internally it sent us on a whole thing

42
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,272
Series of conversations that went all over the place and we'll play you some of that in the next two episodes right now

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
What play you excerpts from Caitlin series end

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Just as a warning

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
There are scenes in what you're about to hear that are

46
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Sexual explicit

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Very much so at times and

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
Strong language probably not the kind of thing that you want to listen to with kids

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Anywhere nearby

50
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Anyhow

51
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,920
We're going to start with an excerpt from the second episode of Caitlin series no for the heart

52
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
This episode she titled inheritance

53
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Hello and welcome to this month's edition of audio smut

54
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm in my twenties I left my tiny little town for the big city

55
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
I live in NYC now

56
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Chinese slippers

57
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
I make an artsy feminist sex radio show

58
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Sex positive feminism tells me that I was onto something back in my teens adopting the same ruthless

59
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Sexual posturing the boys are encouraged to would allow me to wheel some of their power if we f*****

60
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Without feelings we too could be free having slept Pride with cebert the double standard

61
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
That would force the world to recognize that women sexual pleasure is real

62
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
The only problem is that I hate casual sex

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
Make up for it I masturbate with abandon and tell the world about it

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
Switch low medium or high vibration pain

65
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Become an expert at advocating for my own pleasure I know what I want

66
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
I feel entitled to it I really wanted to sleep over but just FYI I'm not

67
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Tupac. Cool

68
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
After all these years I've mastered the art of saying no

69
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Stretch yourself out from downward dog into play

70
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
No

71
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
I know now that what I'm looking for is love even though I know it's corny

72
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,367
Thunder

73
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,695
Not a big brown couch wrapped up in the arms by friend

74
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Jay

75
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
Songs are really

76
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,143
Do my best not to like this more than a friendship with the appropriate a little

77
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Yeah

78
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Okay cool

79
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Go get it

80
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
But of course I can't stop myself from wondering this friendship is the Friendship the right under your nose

81
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
That whole time

82
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
Kind of friendship

83
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
Been friends j48 years like my oldest

84
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,031
How did it go Jan I've always kept it in your pants

85
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Masculine way to this perfect friendly intimacy we call each other babe and boo liebich about oral

86
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
Relationship dramas have extensive Gchat conversations into the night and always sign off with the word love spelled in full

87
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
If I hate my current relationship

88
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
And that's good night night love you with that being the case there are as I think there are like

89
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Great great hookups that are just

90
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
One night stand so

91
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
I've always thought it was hot it looks a little bit like my cousin Robert I had a forbidden crush on when I was a kid

92
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Boyfriend 4th of July

93
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Play 1130

94
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
I want to come over for a snuggle party

95
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Hey

96
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,199
Hey

97
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
What's happening

98
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
Put on some music and sit on the bed woman she's so cool and she kind of had this thing in common where

99
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Arabella

100
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
Billy time in people and we're talking about how like she's not really used to making the move

101
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
The. She sort of create the conditions in which I move can be made

102
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Why

103
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Because

104
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
Looks like some weird power into

105
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
That like submissive role that I just don't think is really there

106
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Are you serious

107
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Really you're going to

108
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
I feel like I'm kind of nervous

109
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Yeah

110
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
That's cute

111
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
Too quick

112
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
He says yeah but you keep going not reading me

113
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing

114
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Define whatever

115
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
Sorry I just have to pause the scene for a second

116
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Give you some information

117
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,927
So what you're hearing right now if you hadn't already noticed

118
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Is a reenactment

119
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
Hugo ya do it

120
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Hey

121
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
This is an actor

122
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Hey

123
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
The name is Tommy and then I'll be like hey like

124
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,031
Can you connect slow down a little bit

125
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Curing yes

126
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
He was pretty like

127
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Progressive

128
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,527
Yeah the making of the story I called the real Jay to verify what happened that night

129
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,647
I also asked him if he wanted to write and re-enact the whole story with me

130
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
But

131
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Are you guys still friends

132
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,839
We started being friends again since I

133
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,983
Call them and ask him if he would do an interview about like you're going to hear more from the real Jay

134
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Later

135
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,663
But what I need you to know right now in this moment is that what you're hearing isn't the real thing

136
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
I built this scene so that it sounds as close to the way that I remember it as possible will kiss again and

137
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Kind of intense again

138
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
And then say it again

139
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
And then you get kind of pissed

140
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
At that moment

141
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
You say

142
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Pine

143
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Astera the overhead

144
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Headlight

145
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
I look at the clock

146
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Almost 1 a.m.

147
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
The air is tense

148
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
I feel like it's my fault

149
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
I know better than that

150
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Go

151
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
But I don't

152
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
Frozen I can't move

153
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
He's back at the zipper of my jeans with my hand on a dick

154
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
If you have a wreck

155
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
This is

156
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
What if you just like

157
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
Go to the bathroom and

158
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Just like

159
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Come back

160
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
What

161
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Cuz I'm we can just make out and be fine

162
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Just do it come on

163
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Touch it come on

164
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Dude

00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
What

166
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,807
On the outside act like everything's fine on the inside I give up

167
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
And the way that feels so familiar to me

168
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
I make myself, in front of him so he can make himself come

169
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
We can go back to having a nice night I feel defeated but the same

170
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Sometime I'm getting off I'm really good at masturbating so it's not hard for it to feel good

171
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:39,807
Perfume moments I forget that I feel like s***

172
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm sad when I leave

173
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
Angry until days afterwards July 5th

174
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
2013 I had the most vile experience

175
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
And then I'm so angry I can barely write about it my diary too angry to the big Scrabble

176
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
I'm angry at so many things

177
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
Performed for him ever form to play kaisa wanted him to be happy more than I wanted myself to be forgot about my

178
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
She forgot about me supposed to be my friend my defenses were down to f*** thought this was a dumb High School dude that college dude

179
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,375
I thought I was past this s*** I thought I'd practice avoiding this s*** f****** 27

180
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
True he didn't force me to do anything

181
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
But I'm on the last felt like I had no choice

182
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Why

183
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
That on me

184
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Where's that on him

185
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:50,975
I begin to wonder if having sex I don't want is something I've absorbed from Generations past

186
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
If it's something I've inherited from my foremothers

187
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
How do you say no that's rude or that's not

188
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Bellator

189
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
Cuz my mom why are you saying know you're hurting the guy is feeling

190
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Friend with someone who you're interested in if you say no are they going to just give up and walk away

191
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
And then you're going okay should I just go along with it so I don't lose that he could have been a great guy

192
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
Heart rate of a guy right balance that out but I think that is where the

193
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
But if you been just walks away

194
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Another friend of ours I mean it's subtle because you know on the one hand you're having attention I mean

195
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,359
I was brought up as a female to

196
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
To want male attention you know that that was

197
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
A status symbol actually you know if you are

198
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,135
Attractive enough woman that you could

199
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
Get attention from man that was considered an important thing that was how you were maybe going to end up finding a husband and

200
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
Having children and doing that really conventional stuff so those ideas they don't defy come

201
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,567
I'm up all of a sudden you know you're you're surrounded by that grow your whole upbringing

202
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,455
When was the first time that you've had an experience where you felt like you were allowed to

203
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Change gears

204
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
I was

205
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
In my late 40s and he stopped

206
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
And asked are you sure this is what you want

207
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,655
I had never ever ever been asked that before and I was like shocked I didn't

208
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,263
Speechless in responding to him because I never had been asked that before

209
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
At this point in my life I felt

210
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,039
Strongly that I was different for my foremothers My Generation would be different

211
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
I talk to people my age

212
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
I hear the same attitudes same feelings

213
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,863
He kept telling me that the reasons I was saying no we're stupid that was drunk and crying

214
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,751
A drunk crying girl generally wants to be consoled to some extent but not with sex

215
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
I told him he couldn't f****** and then his dick wasn't me you know and then I was like oh my God for having sex

216
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
I thought we talked about this

217
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
And even then the whole night was nice

218
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
That part was just sucked a how

219
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
Do I give him what he wants in a way that's not terrible for me but

220
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Nike deal with

221
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
It's like your gut instinct will tell you what no I don't want that since they know and cute way and then say no to 4

222
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
And then there was a point where you just like

223
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
It's like I literally just gave up

224
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Let's just let him have this now because I fought enough and like I don't want to make a scene I don't want to wake up anyone and like

225
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
My roommate sleeping and she's going to get me like I slept on the couch and like it was like his mental gymnastics that

226
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
You do to not tell yourself that you're not putting your needs first but that like all these people up matter

227
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
So much

228
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
Talk to my 20 year old cousin

229
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
She's almost a decade younger than me

230
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Like my first boyfriend

231
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,431
I just wanted to please because I didn't know what I was doing

232
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
So

233
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,295
I was just going for it and trying stuff and leave

234
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Not asking questions

235
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,415
And I've been getting it so I want that person to like me

236
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
I want this to be fun for that person

237
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,303
Not thinking about yourself and just be like I'm trying stuff

238
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,471
Makes me think of something that my best friend Laura said I was talking about being a people-pleaser

239
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I like how

240
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
And you said that that's habitats how women survive I think women survived by

241
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,247
Being aware and reading social cues and

242
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
We know when someone's going to be angry we know when someone might lash out we know when someone's

243
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
The Frayed we know when somebody is sad we know when some of these

244
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Happy ending and

245
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,887
We know when when we're safe and we know when we're not safe and

246
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,031
You know there's the element of using sex as a social currency to stay safe and

247
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
Using sex as a social currency to

248
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Belong in

249
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
The group even if the group is just you and one other person

250
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
Start to wonder if this is how anyone who has historically been on the Shady Side of the power dynamic

251
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
Learn how to move through the world

252
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
How important it can be

253
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
To be liked

254
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
Someone who has your fate in their hands

255
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,687
Sometime after the Jay night I discovered something

256
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
He brought me answers

257
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
It sounds Hotel

258
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Llama sound like

259
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
It was a recording

260
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Not a re-enactment

261
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
An actual recording

262
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
I made this recording two years before the day night

263
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
When I was 25

264
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,591
In this recording I'm sitting in a windowless bedroom with a guy named Raul

265
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
I'm doing an interview about intuition for the show

266
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,599
Well the times for me intuition just means getting your mind out of the way and being observant

267
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
This guy Raul and I dated for a while

268
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,791
I smiled at him in a coffee shop and he ran down the street after me asking if he could take me out sometime

269
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
I was Charmed by him

270
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
But after a few weeks he totally ghosted me

271
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,519
By the time of this recording it's been months since we last spoken

272
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,639
I did that dumb thing where I needed an interview for the show and I was like oh my God

273
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
To be perfect

274
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
So

275
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Here we are

276
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
When the interview ends

277
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
I leave the tape rolling because just good radio practice

278
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:16,255
Often the most intimate parts of the interview happen after it's officially over

279
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
So we're just sitting on his bed

280
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,375
I know beyond a shadow of a doubt

281
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
They don't want to have sex with him or anything along those lines

282
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
That were flirting a little bit

283
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
And I'm enjoying it

284
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Mama by Fela

285
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Massage

286
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Okay

287
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
I'm down I'm down for that but

288
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,543
On my back

289
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
You can try to seduce me

290
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
But I want you to

291
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,039
Touch me in sexy places

292
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Upromise

293
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,888
Oppressor off

294
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
Definitely

295
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Booty belt

296
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Under breast

297
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Under breast is okay

298
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
But you have to be very like

299
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
Aware

300
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,224
Use your intuition

301
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,088
But even if it seems like I want you to you have to be nice and good

302
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Okay

303
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,512
Massage to me is as intimate as a handshake

304
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,072
But I know that's not the case for everyone

305
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
So

306
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,472
I start to try to vocalize my boundaries and make sure that what's going on is cool for everyone here

307
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,384
Can you to feel like you can do it like you can touch a woman without like

308
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Having

309
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
Like feeling like you need to

310
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Soccer

311
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
I don't know I mean like so for example

312
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,608
For example right now the way that you're touching me makes me feel like

313
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,472
Later I'm going to have to tell you that I don't have sex with you

314
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Tiananmen

315
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
And I just wonder like

316
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
If it's possible

317
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Like

318
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
Is it possible for men to feel like

319
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
Cotuit to genuinely enjoy like

320
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,800
But but do you get off on my trying to change someone's mind

321
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
Girlfriend

322
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,680
This is the sound of me and Raul having sex

323
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
When I listen to this recording I hear myself say no again

324
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,920
Presumably when he tries to escalate to full on penetration

325
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Show camera

326
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
I feel a little bit like

327
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Are you

328
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
I mean I feel good but

329
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
S7 want to

330
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
Are we just retarded when it comes to

331
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
What we want

332
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
How do we know what we want

333
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:41,216
What part of you knows that you want cuz he was taking analytical mind that knows that you want

334
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
No how could it be

335
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
I mean it doesn't make any sense is analogical

336
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
We can only

337
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
Trigasm

338
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
After the post-coital cigarette

339
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
I didn't stay over

340
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Which is really unlike me

341
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,424
I walked home through a gray Bushwick Warehouse land

342
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Angry

343
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
Raul for ignoring everything I said

344
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,360
At myself for totally folding when he push my line

345
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
And at my body

346
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
For betraying me

347
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
For enjoying the sex

348
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,368
I got to go to the interview part of the recording we did produce the intuition show

349
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
Unless it's recording silent in the archives

350
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
4 years

351
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Until one shitty night just like it

352
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
I've been to me on the 4th of July

353
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
With an old friend

354
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Jay

355
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
In the months after the Jay night I dug up this recording

356
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
And I listened closely to myself

357
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,152
I listen to the way that I actually sound

358
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
In A Night Like This

359
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,552
My boundaries are crossed

360
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
My best friend Laura listen to this

361
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
She said it definitely sounded like I wanted to f*** this guy

362
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
If you take away the words and just listen to the sounds

363
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,008
This is probably exactly the way that I found it

364
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
When I was with j

365
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
Say no in the sweet seductive tone

366
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
I'm trying so hard to be nice and not hurt anybody's feelings that

367
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
I know basically sounds like f******

368
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
But on the other hand

369
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,768
I wonder how many people sound just like this when they are getting hot and heavy with someone and they're trying to draw a line

370
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Express what they want in a way that doesn't break the flirtatious vibe

371
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
But doesn't negate the possibility of doing other things

372
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,800
I wonder how many people sound just like this when they're scared

373
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
I think this is why the definition of consent has evolved

374
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,272
To me more than no means no or even Yes means yes

375
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,392
Consent is about knowing that someone is excited about what's going on

376
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
It's about knowing that both people are on the same page

377
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,560
And it's knowing that knowing that is really complicated

378
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,400
Not just because communication is hard and sex that is awful

379
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,800
But also because there are invisible social and historical context that play in these intimate moments

380
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Contacts that

381
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Impact

382
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
How entitled we feel to our own comfort

383
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,248
How likely we are to put someone else's needs first

384
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,136
These contacts could be historical like race or class or gender

385
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Or they could be super situational

386
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
Like when one person is a little bit in love with you and you are in love with them and you can totally sense that they'll do what

387
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Whatever you want

388
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
When things are uneven in this way

389
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
It's important to take extra care

390
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
To create an emotional environment that allows for a no

391
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,200
I didn't feel like I had that space and either of these encounters

392
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
But on the other hand I should have been stronger and advocating for myself

393
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,672
I'm bummed because I thought I was over this s***

394
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
But it seems like I'm going to be struggling with this

395
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
My entire life

396
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
And after all this contemplating

397
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
The anger that I have it myself

398
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Slowly

399
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Dissipates

400
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
I start getting angry at J

401
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,640
I was not angry at rule because we weren't that close

402
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
Vagina work clothes

403
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
I expected so much more from him

404
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
Expected him to care more about the way I felt

405
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
In the same way that I had cared about the way he felt

406
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,792
I knew that the strong thing to do

407
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Would be to talk all this out with him

408
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
2 days after the night

409
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
PG chatted me

410
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
I ended up sleeping all day

411
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
And then two days later

412
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
A month later on my birthday

413
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Happy birthday

414
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Thanks darling

415
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
How are you babe

416
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
Two weeks after that

417
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
5 days later

418
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
Same day

419
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
What's up

420
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Thank God you answered I was getting worried you were active

421
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Totally ignoring me

422
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
How are you

423
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
I say home every time I friends get together and I know he'll be there

424
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,696
I tried to tell her friends what happened

425
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
But when I say it out loud it does sound like almost nothing

426
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
I'm a surface we had which day would later call

427
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Drunken night of masturbation failure

428
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
No big deal

429
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Problem is that

430
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,384
We don't have a vocabulary around emotion that would let me describe with any sense of legitimacy

431
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,712
The totally invisible things that happened between us that night

432
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
Can we come back from break

433
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
Going to hear from the other side of the aisle from guy's point of views DJ

434
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
Listen to Radiolab we will continue in a moment I'm Ryan and I'm

435
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
Calling from Lake Tahoe California

436
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,720
More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

439
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,704
I'm Jedi boom Rod this is Radiolab in the no part 1 in collaboration with Kaitlin Prest

440
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
So we're starting things off with excerpts

441
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,640
From a series of stories Caitlin produced for show she hosted and created called the heart

442
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Series called no

443
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,040
We just heard a chunk from episode 2 of her series when she calls in herons

444
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
In the third

445
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
She explores things from the man's point of view where I was like I knew that I wanted to interview men

446
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,608
And I just interview the people who had access to which are my best friends my exes

447
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
And I was like oh well interview men

448
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
Interview people who have

449
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,752
I perpetrate like you have pushed

450
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
On the other side

451
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
And so I just yeah I realize that almost all the all of my close friends had a story in the same way

452
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,320
That all my clothes women friends had a story about pushing and knowing that they pushed too far

453
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
And that's actually what you hear in episode 3 of the series called answers were going to play you some excerpts of that now starting a few

454
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Few minutes into it

455
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
Just as I unknowingly into the disappointment of my parents absorb certain ideas about how I was supposed to be a

456
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Girl in this world

457
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,128
Boise the disappointment of their parents

458
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
Absorb ideas to

459
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
Feeling the need to girls

460
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
Try to get some that was the plan

461
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:37,888
13 year old boy and his friends create an elaborate plan to get the girls to do sex stuff

462
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
Beer and making the move like that was like the magic answer they learn from older boys

463
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,688
Men's magazines that getting girls drunk is crucial to the goal of getting girls to do sex stuff

464
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
Cheating in a construction site after 3 beers

465
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
Why does hand underneath the lip of Genesis pants she sits up straight

466
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
So I'll try a little more take as hand away he puts it back

467
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
That's what you're supposed to do right takes it away he puts it back

468
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,688
15 year old boy leans back in his chair

469
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:29,088
Cutting his knees rest on the back of the chair in front of him leaning up against whatever girls but is in the seat

470
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
Sitting behind the girl who I was attracted to you that I would spend a lot of time reading back in This Not That unnatural but not

471
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
That natural leader position and not at guys

472
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
Change it

473
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
A 26 year-old boy invites his good friend over to his house late at night

474
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,664
And playfully ignores her when she says she doesn't want to do anything below the belt

475
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,016
When she asks him to jerk off in the bathroom he laughs

476
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
And they resolved to jerk off beside each other instead

477
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,000
After that night I don't talk to or cj4 years

478
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
In that time

479
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
I searched for answers elsewhere

480
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
Become obsessed with the topic of consent okay so the idea about the episode is that

481
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,360
I want to hear about a time where I like someone said no and you pushed

482
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
It became

483
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,784
Clear you both wanted to consent inherent to you like when you were young or did you have to like

484
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
Unlearn things that you

485
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Women that I know

486
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,024
Almost every woman in queer I know has a story about being pressured or coerced into sex by a dude

487
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Let me wonder

488
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Does that mean that

489
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
Every man I know has a story

490
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,984
About pressuring or coercing someone into sex

491
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,848
I start out by talking to the men in my life that I trust the most

492
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
Shall we go to remain nameless or what

493
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,736
Well it's hard cuz you're my dad do you know what I mean

494
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,088
It's fine whatever okay so tell me the story

495
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,208
Long story was I had a real crush on this girl

496
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
She got

497
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Pretty drunk

498
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
So I went down and

499
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
Snuggle.

500
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:20,704
And I was rubbing her sides and then we kissed a little bit but that was the extent of it

501
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,080
You know nothing to too serious by today's standards but by then that was a big deal

502
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
But

503
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
At that time

504
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,200
What was the big deal

505
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Leonardo's

506
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Yeah

507
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,880
Yas and enjoying that plus she was ferret wearing h

508
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,768
Free sweater which was really nice and I still remember it anyway

509
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
It was not it was not usual self

510
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
When did you know that she was upset about it

511
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,568
The day after we heard through the grapevine we didn't have

512
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,688
Texting your Facebook fan but you heard pretty quick Through the Grapevine yeah that it

513
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,504
He was very unhappy about what it happened

514
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
And felt

515
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
I've used or taken advantage of

516
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,024
My relationship was never the same after that I went and apologized but that was there is no

517
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,704
Coming back from that and so I felt regretful and paid for it because we were no longer friends after that

518
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
This is a best friend of mine

519
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:32,384
As soon as I knew that sex wasn't an option I became a bit of a dick

520
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
I

521
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Got kind of cold

522
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
And like

523
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
Not really communicative

524
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
Or

525
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
Yeah I just became like a stereotypical

526
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Dick

527
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,584
And I became like grumpy

528
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
Had this really like f*** this attitude like you all if I'm not getting what I what I came here for

529
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Dead Like Me

530
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
I guess I'm lucky that I got this is like

531
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Really intense

532
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
Detailed email from her

533
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,928
You know breaking down what I did why was bad how much it hurt her how it affected her for like days

534
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
Is after

535
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,512
And and I'm not going to lie

536
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
I also had that

537
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
Reaction which you've described

538
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,496
Dislike initial reaction of like a here like over exaggerating

539
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
This is my first love

540
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,640
Well I remember you told me the story of the this one night that you had with this woman

541
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
Can you tell me that story I can tell you that story so

542
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:45,344
We were dancing we were drinking she not getting really drunk

543
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
And her friends are like

544
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Definitely putting down

545
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
The collective foot

546
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,816
Saying that no I shouldn't sleep with her tonight that she was too drunk

547
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,656
She's like I want you to come over

548
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
Went over to her place and

549
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,568
Is in bed with her and we're making out and it was getting heavy

550
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
She could feel that I was

551
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Like moving in

552
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
She kind of like

553
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,504
Like no no

554
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Just kind of like a whisper

555
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
Like I know keeping it

556
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Sexy but like

557
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
Saying like now you know

558
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
I felt kind of confused

559
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
Because that night like

560
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,168
You know we are out and she invited me over to her house

561
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:37,056
And for me that's like a message that she wants to hookup that like she wants something to happen

562
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,944
Otherwise like why invite the person you've been making out with all night over to your place at like

563
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
4 in the morning

564
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
LSi

565
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
You're looking

566
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
I like

567
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
Fool around a bit more

568
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
And

569
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
So like I remember

570
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
Getting off of her

571
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,632
Just lying there for a bit feeling kind of disappointed

572
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,192
Then like started making out again

573
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,544
Going around again in the sky like the same process it happened and

574
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
Like after doing that for I don't know maybe 20 minutes like

575
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
I like got back on top and

576
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,272
Was kind of making the same moves and

577
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
She didn't say no

578
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,672
It wasn't that point of interjection where she like said no before

579
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
And like

580
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
So I just went for it cuz I was like

581
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,120
Stupid in young and I feel like it's wrong now you know

582
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Like I feel like

583
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,496
Chad said no before and like I should just been really vocal

584
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,872
About like communicating boundaries and like seeing what she wanted for the night you know

585
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
But do you think that there was a moment where you stop thinking about what she wanted and was focusing mostly on what you wanted

586
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
Yeah I mean I feel like probably the entire encounter

587
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,440
I was thinking what I wanted as opposed to what she wanted

588
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,280
I mean I thought that it would she wanted was the same thing as what I want in

589
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
And

590
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
You know what it wasn't that way I felt like

591
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
I was trying to make it that way

592
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
In this episode Caitlin goes on to

593
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Speak to a whole collection of other guys who

594
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,712
All describe different flavors of the same experience of gently pushing

595
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Sometimes not so gently

596
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Pass that

597
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
Personnel

598
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:29,952
We're going to skip over some of that and engine for a few minutes because eventually Caitlin does end up

599
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Convincing Jay to speak with her on tape

600
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
You want to start

601
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Me

602
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Yeah

603
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
Yeah I mean what were you thinking

604
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,032
But you should start yeah that's what I was thinking too

605
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:49,664
But when you gave me the option I was like was there an alternative I mean I would love an alternative

606
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,992
Not starting would be the alternative

607
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
This is Jay

608
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
The real one

609
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
No reenactment snow actors

610
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,024
It's been three years since we had that shity hook up that inspired this entire series

611
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,608
I knew that after interviewing all of these men

612
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
He was the one I really needed to talk to

613
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
I procrastinated calling him for months

614
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
He definitely knows that I was upset

615
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
But I don't think he knows exactly why

616
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
Olympics interview

617
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
I have to tell him why

618
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,672
I'm afraid I'm afraid of the same thing I was afraid of that night

619
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,232
Afraid of silencing myself

620
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
To avoid uncomfortable moment

621
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,448
I'm afraid that he's going to convince me that my feelings are illegitimate and I'm afraid that you'll be a jerk

622
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,800
Over the years Jay has become kind of a monster in my head

623
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Stereotype has morphed into a combination of every man I've ever felt sexually coerced by

624
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
Become the poster boy

625
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,975
I think they're feminists because it took some courses in college and really love women

626
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
Friend Jay is gone

627
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
Even know who that person is anymore

628
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,191
But a part of my heart opens

629
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
He says yes to doing this interview

630
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
I can tell that he doesn't really want to do it

631
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,175
I can tell that he's doing it because he wants to help me out

632
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,759
He could sense how much I really wanted him to say yes

633
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
So

634
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,879
What if I don't know why don't you

635
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
I mean should we do the hard part first or the easy part first

636
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
Nervous about talking about

637
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
Like me and you and stuff you know

638
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,775
I know why do you have to make that face is that face cuz you feel like it's stupid or is that face like

639
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,639
No it's not stupid it's of course it's valid it's like it's legit

640
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
But I just

641
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
Doesn't it feel like such a small

642
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,695
But see that I think that that's the thing is that it feels so much bigger to me than it does to you I think

643
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,815
I really knew you were going to say that isn't what you want

644
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
I just saw it coming

645
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
I also just don't feel like

646
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,639
Me just rehashing every it's just so much work

647
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Can't we just

648
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:35,807
Can we just move on like really is it really that big a deal like honestly I mean

649
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:41,951
The thing is it's not in your daily life like can this really follow you around

650
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
I mean

651
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,375
There's like the honest answer to that question and then there is the answer to that question which is like

652
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,959
Me really wanting to not make you feel bad do you know what I mean

653
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
To my thinking it's just like

654
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
In all of our friendship

655
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
Knowing what you know about me

656
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Don't I get a pass

657
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,039
For one infraction of this line

658
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
I just

659
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,671
Stupid I just wasn't shrunken school like

660
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
Lake pushed over

661
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,863
All syringes made such a big mistake and I get that it was a big mistake but it was a mistake and it was like wow

662
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Wantonly

663
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
You know

664
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
Would it be so bad I'm not asking you to get over it

665
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,823
But just like in the abstract

666
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
If you think about other like another friendship not hours

667
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,015
Would it be so bad to just get over that one thing you know

668
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
Like doesn't really warrant becoming

669
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
Baggage for so many years

670
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,279
Yeah that could also just be me since I'm the one who f***** up

671
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,887
But I also think you f****** overreacted so you know

672
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
I don't know I mean

673
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,799
And you're also like haven't talked to me for years until now you need something right

674
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,615
My giggling tells me that I'm nervous

675
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:08,735
But I know that in this moment I'm also relieved that we're getting right into it

676
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Looking him in the eye for the computer

677
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
Singing to his bedroom

678
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
Watching angle the camera so that the lights flattering

679
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
The Dubrow monster melts away

680
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,815
I'm just chilling with my friend Jay

681
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
About to have

682
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,911
Pretty intimate conversation

683
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Can a nice

684
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Not

685
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Scared of him anymore

686
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,151
I'm scared of is that I won't have the courage to say what I need to say

687
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
But

688
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
Start

689
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
Yeah that's true that's true

690
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:50,719
Farpoint but I have to say that like I didn't remember you ever saying sorry or like acknowledging my feelings about

691
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,559
Or even just saying sorry like I just didn't remember you saying sorry like I felt like

692
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,887
I really trusted you as a friend

693
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
And that like

694
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,007
I said I don't really want to touch Jon's and then you kept trying to

695
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
Junk touching

696
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,199
I'm putting my hand on your junk and stuff like that you know what I mean and telling me to touch your junk and like

697
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,247
And I kept trying to sort of like push

698
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
At this point I talked for about 10 minutes straight

699
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
I tell him all of it

700
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
He just listens

701
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
When sitting here and there

702
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
And tell him what he did how it made me feel

703
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,447
I tell him about Trevor Smalls and a b****** in the basement

704
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
I tell him that he said and did things that I brought me back there

705
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
I tell him he made me feel like a means to an end

706
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Yeah okay

707
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,767
I don't I guess that I don't know what else to say

708
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,839
It would have been nice to have had this conversation then right

709
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
After

710
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
It happened because

711
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Like you said to its

712
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Sleep timer

713
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Reject offer

714
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
In front of each other

715
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
And I was like yeah I was like a super pushy drunk

716
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
Hookup guy

717
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
But that's all I want I wasn't

718
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Basement

719
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:26,975
Guy I know but I understand

720
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,303
I heard everything you said

721
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
That you just said

722
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
I heard it all

723
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,727
I guess it was frustrating it is like the fact that there is

724
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
Trauma

725
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
The den compound

726
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,639
That's like a fact but it'll be

727
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,175
Nice to know

728
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
Which specific ones

729
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,039
We're getting added to it to me

730
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,623
Cuz like I know I pushed you back there

731
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
But then those things that you experience

732
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
And not what happened this is Sarah like I don't ya

733
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
I mean I think that like it's

734
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
It's whether it's not even much of a difference

735
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:10,751
But that's the thing I guess it did feel like

736
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
Write me off

737
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:18,431
Where do I get to do you know what that's not me like I'm not all those other

738
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,831
People I'm sorry that this had that like we got drunk together and that I tried to do hand stuff and you didn't want to

739
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,647
And then it ended up with us doing heads up next one another

740
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:31,743
And I'm sorry that still drunkenly I was a dick

741
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
And I'm sorry that drunkenly I said a bad thing and you know I'm sorry of for all that but it's like

742
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
How bad do I have to feel

743
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,663
One thing is like parsing out where I end and like all the other terrible dudes in the world begin

744
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,247
Which is a frustrating thing for a young man to deal with

745
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:59,903
F*** man also like how can I done my time like do I really have to feel like I haven't gotten to talk to you

746
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,439
You for years now because of it

747
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
Play how much guilt do I really have to have

748
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
See you making me feel bad

749
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,471
Okay no I just want to know okay

750
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,799
You're making me feel bad okay

751
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
No I don't think that you

752
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
That I don't think I asked

753
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Westfield Corporation

754
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:33,439
And then the only reason I asked that but it is an isolated incident in our friendship it is

755
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,839
We talked for about an hour and a half total I'll spare you all the details mostly we just kept circling back

756
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,679
Back around the same point why it shouldn't be that big of a deal

757
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,079
Family I realize that I never got a chance to ask what is inner monologue was that night

758
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,943
Or what larger personal and social context might have been a play

759
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
But

760
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
I wasn't silent

761
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
Did my ground

762
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
I fought for the we didn't receive my feelings but I felt like you missed some of my Q you were

763
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Most women are dealing with some degree of sexual trauma is like the right thing to look at it through the lens

764
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,799
Of being a free about isolating specific sexual activity

765
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
Worse than that one friend of mine says that they're upset that my first reaction is to be like oh my god what the f*** did I do I'm so sore

766
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:33,599
Sorry X suddenly to you I was just like a means to an end

767
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
It still makes me angry that I had to fight so hard for legitimacy of my feelings

768
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
In the first place

769
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,583
I want to start cutting the interview

770
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
Start to hear

771
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
Accusatory his voice sounds instead of talking about why

772
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:58,175
Why he was drunk that night we talked about why I'm a jerk for being upset about it

773
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:04,575
Hear how each of his apologies were paired the rebuttal of the entire premise of the conversation

774
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,975
Play this is not what an apology sounds like

775
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:17,375
I was a dick and you know I'm sorry up for all that but it's like

776
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
How bad do I have to feel this is what an apology sounds like

777
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,079
Kaitlyn

778
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
So sorry

779
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
I mean I

780
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:36,319
That's f***** up that's Tommy the actor who played Jay in the last episode I hired Tommy

781
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
I feel like to do more than just explain myself

782
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:49,119
Politely that actually but to actually get angry it was your fault

783
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
I'm realizing that now that you know why it was your fault I'm going to tell you why

784
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:01,919
You're f****** a******

785
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,719
Hurt your feelings I would feel like s*** about nothing feel like s*** about treating me like a f****** Barbie. I was taught from birth

786
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:21,119
You want for what I want f****** job to be sensitive to that masculinity really f****** wife

787
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
Great job. And I hate you for up all the f****** privilege card you're acting like

788
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:32,895
I f****** hate you and your client

789
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,295

That

791
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:45,183
Documentary that we just heard a big excerpt of that was that was a few years ago at this point

792
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:49,023
Have you spoken with Jason Centerview Revisited that that conversation at all

793
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,607
I wish I mean like

794
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
I why wouldn't I would love I would love to have a kind of like a closing out conversation

795
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
Done with him I did check in with him over the course of the whole production and I sent him the cuts before they went

796
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,503
And I just keep right reaching out to him saying do you want to talk

797
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
He doesn't want to talk he's not answering
