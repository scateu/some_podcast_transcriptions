1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
3-2-1 hey I'm Jared I'm rubber

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
Delicious Radiolab for today

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,416
We're going to begin with a conversation we had actually

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
I I would benefit from a little bit of framing about kind of what we were like our goal of the session

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Sure we can frame it

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
Make you blab a lot and then we added later

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Right

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,776
It's a conversation we had with a reporter

12
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,760
She at the time was a New York Times

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
But is now the editorial director

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Upworthy

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,648
So the start actually threw up

16
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
Personal interest lies in a relationship with milk

17
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
And I was very open about that

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Talk about it with all my friends and we open with him

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Yeah I mean I would say

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
He was in some denial and but yeah I was

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
I regularly would tell him hey like you have a problem with this

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
You know when he would be clear back

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
So you know if you're going to make me choose

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
Between me and vodka I'm going to choose vodka

25
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
So

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
And I was going to be young

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
But every night after 11 my life

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Became

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
Without getting into a lot of detail there were

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Fights

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Arguments

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
A lot of rage

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
And I didn't know what to do and then felt really out of control and

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
And I've been to Al-Anon meetings and

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Jesse Metcalfe

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,424
Terrible tragic problem that like a really smart cool person would turn really awful on you

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,520
But then one day Amy found herself in Barnes & Noble on Union Square

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Union Square

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
Think I'm on the third floor and there was a

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,688
The table of mostly self-help books and there was this one called the end of my addiction

41
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Fiction

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
She picked it up

43
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,136
This book was super fascinating it was the Memoir of a French cardiologist

44
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
This French Doctor Who had his life completely ruined by alcoholism

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
And I looked at it and I probably stood there like feet glued

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
To the floor and just like red

47
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
70%

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
The book described in very Vivid detail this successful doctor just sliding off the rails

49
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,920
Are detoxes and medical treatment facilities you know upwards of a half-dozen times

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Is practicing falling off he was losing everything in his life

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
In the back of a taxi

52
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,696
Blood all over himself doesn't it was blood it is doesn't know where he's going

53
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Used totally desperate

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
He kill himself was the next option

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
And then at one point he says that he had read this

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Tiny nugget

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
And this is like the

58
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Early 90

59
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,312
Barely eat some lacrosse the short piece about a guy who's been addicted to cocaine

60
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Taking some muscle

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
And

62
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Cravings for cocaine completely

63
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
You're just one guy one guy six

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Eats all that and he basically just felt like

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Well I might as well try it

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
I'm just going to experiment on myself

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
So he gets the drug

68
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Start taking it and he slowly like doses up

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
More and more mount

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
The drug nothing happens nothing happens and then at one point he says the switch

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,824
And once the switch hit you just became absolutely indifferent.

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,224
Apparently this obsessive need for alcohol that it burdens him his entire life

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Just went away

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Total indifference

75
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Baclofen

76
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
BAC

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Clo Fe

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Amy Says at this point

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Standing there in the Barnes Noble

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
She was interested

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Skeptical

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
But interested

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Yeah so I found an email address

84
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,496

00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264

00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
And emailed him and he wrote back

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Right away

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
And they said

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
You know I'm already we haven't planned it Advanced Eye Care

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576

Can I call you back

94
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,447
Did you hear wind in the background and and the sound of no no

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
But he did seem like he was exerting himself to some extent

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
So you know we schedule a second appointment and

97
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Recorded the phone call

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Yesterday

00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Am I kind

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,975
To talk to you in the loop

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
I was rescuing my girlfriend I got a ticket like a hitch

102
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Switzerland

103
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239
So he launches into the mountain story and then

104
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
This kind of goes off

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
When Moses open the red

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Make Matrix

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
I am who I wanted

108
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Einstein

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
The Einstein was right and who is playing today

110
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,471
You like literally went on for 20 minutes

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Before I got in

112
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
With a little

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
I read your book

114
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
They was off again

115
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
United States

116
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,167
Like literally was 20 minutes of on Fortner shared mission was to like save the world

117
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
Red flags going off left and right

118
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
And I sort of started to

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Downshift

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
My

121
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Thought of doing a story

122
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
And

123
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,223
Right about this time I reporting group got disbanded do it and due to an internal reorganization and so

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
I moved to a different desk and it was like okay

125
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,367
Maybe someday Radiolab will be interested

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Kids will eat anything

127
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
No in all fairness dr. Mason to enforcing passed away a few years ago

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,679
May have been in the middle of a manic episode which doesn't necessarily negate his story with

129
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Even after dropping the story Amy as a journalist is someone who can

130
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
Personally affected by alcoholism is incredibly torn

131
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
As a journalist

132
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
You have to be

133
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Skeptical of everything but

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
At the same time like when it be great if we lived in a world where you could

135
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
Deal with this problem which you know tear it apart so many lives

136
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
Kill so many people create all kinds of pain and agony

137
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
With like a medication

138
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
That just seems

139
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Great

140
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
A question for me

141
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
We often see addiction is like

142
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Things that you've got them morally conqueror

143
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Spiritual calamity

144
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
They've got some how we organize your entire being in order

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Through

146
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
But what if it's not that way what if it's

147
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
What if it's simply a switch in your brain that got stuck in the on position

148
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Can use a pill that

149
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Just switch it right off

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
It would be nice

151
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
Now we were super skeptical of this idea but we also couldn't stop thinking about it

152
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
So recently

153
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
We start making some calls

154
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
Hi Santa Rosa Childress I'm all here

155
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
Dr. Anna Rose Childress is an addiction researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and Amy point of this to her because it was her

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
Work that actually inspired doctor me

157
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
I don't know if you mention throbbing pulsing desire States but somehow that comes to mind

158
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
That's our specialty

159
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
Throbbing pulsing desire States

160
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Sounds great

161
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,863
She spoke with the prettiest Randy Mills and I in the studio and she's been studying that craving State and addiction

162
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
She's interview people about it what patients described

163
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Tumi

164
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
Is it they would sometimes described as head of a wave of sensation

165
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
Just pulsates throughout your whole body

166
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,455
Their toes up to their head back down again

167
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Okay one day in 1995 she's at a conference she bumps into a guy who tells her he has managed

168
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
To get some rats addicted to cocaine give them Baclofen and they totally lost interest in the

169
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
They were just interested for several hours

170
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
So I saw this and I thought

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Well

172
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
So she began to give baclofen to people

173
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Who are addicted to crack

174
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Small doses

175
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
And initially there was a lot of disappointment

176
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Results

177
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Then she says one day she was sitting in the staff Lounge

178
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Chilling

179
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Macaulay Grant

180
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Guy over

181
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Hospital next door

182
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
And you know it was you got to talk to him

183
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
His name was Ed Coleman

184
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Is a paraplegic

185
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
He had a drug deal gone wrong

186
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Been shot in the neck

187
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Paralyzed from the waist down so he was in a wheelchair taking Baclofen

188
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Spasms in legs

189
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,223
He recounted this to me and actually have the tape of it doing low dose at first

190
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
And that was 10 mg 4 times a day

191
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,135
Tell me why you up the dose

192
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Turn

193
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Nintendo's

194
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Does it take your muscles

195
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
I'm still beat up my legs are stingy

196
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
So I said well maybe if I take two

197
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
What did you notice

198
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
What Edward found was that when he doubled

199
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
His baclofen dose

200
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Teens cocaine

201
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
No longer had the high

202
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
When I was taking it

203
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Manhattan cream

204
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,583
Even when I'm to tell that when he stopped taking baclofen cuz he did stop for 2 days

205
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
I was having bad spasms the leg spasms came back

206
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
He could get the high again and the craving went through the ceiling

207
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
So Edward had been doing his own experiments did have the toast to see

208
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,879
What was the dose wake Stone, cocaine high but it hasn't wouldn't be driving him crazy

209
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Wow so he's like a one-man study

210
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,095
This is actually the specific story that inspired Dr Mason to do his one-man studying to write that book

211
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
Which held Amy

212
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Glute

213
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
To the floor in Barnes & Noble

214
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
Now even though none of this was

215
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
Rock Solid science by any means

216
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Amy says that since then

217
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
People have begun

218
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Quietly

219
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Take this drug in some doctors if you going to prescribe it I talked to a guy who runs a halfway house in Youngstown Ohio

220
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:09,183
Who is using baclofen with people that were under his care there was a doctor

221
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,279
In Chicago who is prescribing it to a lot of people that Zoloft

222
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
Jobs in the book message boards

223
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,959
Hundreds of people on these boards swapping stories about how much they took when they took it

224
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
They were crowdsourcing their own cure in effect

225
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
The really surprising

226
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Is it as we kept calling around we realized that Baclofen

227
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Was just the tip of the iceberg

228
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,087
Yes yes there's another drug a can of procedure campral

229
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
And this other drug Gabapentin is Topiramate or Topamax

230
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
Disulfiram Chantix Suboxone

231
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
Naltrexone buprenorphine is a Doctor Mark willenbring

232
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Addiction psychiatrist

233
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,471
Securian Saint Paul Minnesota

234
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Others

235
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Try to Target the high that you get a simple way to put it is this

236
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
It's a buzzkill

237
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
The bus schedule

238
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,991
Interesting seat drink but you don't get the milk at the happy warm feeling

239
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Apparently takes all the fun out of

240
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
According to one journalist we talk to Gabrielle Glaser who does a ton of reporting about mental health and addiction

241
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,815
30 L but she tried one of these trucks during the course of reporting and

242
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,655
It honestly it made a second glass of wine same about as

243
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Enjoyable as a

244
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
A glass of Dimetapp

245
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
It was it was just

246
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
It was like drinking water

247
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Why what is the drug supposedly doing

248
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Well

249
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
It blocks opioid receptors in the brain which is our pleasure sis

250
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
According to Dr dr. willenbring

251
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
Basically if you think of like if you think of a good Buzz as a

252
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,743
Has like a chemical handshake like you've got the alcohol molecules

253
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,887
I need to click in with the receptors in your brain and that's what creates ultimately the good feeling

254
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
What is what does category of drug

255
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,335
Do is they they get in the middle of the handshake they sort of like a blanket prevent the hands from shaking or muffled them

256
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Search Bright

257
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
And if you're not getting as much enjoyment out of the drinks

258
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Any ideas or not

259
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
I can drink as much

260
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
And these are home run

261
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Drugs Eden things are drugs that you just don't

262
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
See

263
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
These kinds of effects

264
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
In medicine

265
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
And hardly any say

266
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
Mark Twain Addison Studies have been done in Finland

267
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,143
Are the Netherlands UK run a bunch of us

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,727
Hey look at this one particular drug called Naltrexone and show

269
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
It has a very high success rate

270
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Like one particular study in Finland 150 people show that this truck has a 78% success rate

271
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Helping

272
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Very heavy drinker

273
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Reduce their drinking to normal levels

274
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Sprint

275
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
So are these rocks venues

276
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
No

277
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:55,071
Basically the pickup has been near zero

278
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
This is something over and over again

279
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
These trucks are out there that there's there is some evidence that they work

280
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,823
But they're kind of invisible yes that's Gabrielle Glaser again

281
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Shear

282
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,455
About 1% of people who suffer from alcohol use disorder

283
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,575
Ever given the choice or an option to take any sort of medication

284
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Set B1 2% of best

285
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Yes

286
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
Which is particularly weird she says because that drug Naltrexone was using the Finish study that did well

287
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
It's been out for a while

288
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,167
This drug was approved by the FDA in 1994

289
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
I'm by the way the purpose of treating alcoholics

290
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
We never heard about it

291
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
That's so weird

292
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
Well that's a very complicated question should sort of hard to pin down but that there had basically just been this psychic

293
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Barriers we've all had

294
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
To seeing addiction is something up

295
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Pill

296
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Can help I mean just look at med school

297
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
I think there are something around 240 Medical

298
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Schools in the United

299
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
In only 14 medical schools

300
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Was there a single

301
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Course

302
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
In addiction medicine

303
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
That number has since gone up a little bit but not a lot and so we asked her why would that be

304
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
She said well

305
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
It's just that addiction treatment has never really been part of the rest of medicine it has been complete

306
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Desegregated

307
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
It's been snowing self-contained world and

308
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
This actually goes back to how it was set up

309
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
The very beginning of fast I need to go back about 80 years we had in hospitals at the time in the late 19th

310
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Recent early 1940s we had

311
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Tuberculosis

312
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
TV Awards

313
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
But then

314
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Funway

315
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
After World War II TB how to cure

316
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,799
You got better you didn't have to stay in the hospital in the sanitarium just

317
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,151
Tampa cover and suddenly these TV units were empty

318
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
And she says it was just a

319
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
A few years earlier

320
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Data group

321
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Of mostly man that got together

322
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
To form Alcoholics Anonymous

323
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
Doctors had no idea what

324
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
To do with alcohol

325
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
People they were called drunkards inebriate was another word that was commonly used

326
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,983
Of course the founders of a new this so when they saw all those empty TV War

327
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
They went to the hospital

328
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Let's

329
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Make

330
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,919
Those alcoholism units in your hospital

331
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
Family doctors

332
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,343
Okay we don't have an answer for these guys so we'll just let them let them do it and

333
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Naspghan

334
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
80 years

335
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Separation

336
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
And that's where we are now

337
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,863
Out of this physical separation according to Gabrielle Glaser you got a

338
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
Cultural separation 2

339
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Very different ways of singing

340
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,335
Culture II what does that mean it's just like someone in the medical Sciences who might

341
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Decline to see addiction as

342
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Purely biologic

343
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
That's all

344
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
I will just fix it will just fix it

345
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Play there's something deeply wrong here there's a

346
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Something in the person in the spirit in the souls is a reflection of your inner broken self

347
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Dressed at a higher level

348
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
The AA curriculum

349
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
I may have my facts wrong I believe

350
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,055
5 out of the 12 Steps mention God

351
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Text you when we checked it

352
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
6 out of 12

353
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,455
Half and the big book which is the Bible of of Alcoholics Anonymous

354
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
There's a mention of God or him or your higher power

355
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
On almost every page

356
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
What is the recovery rate from the AA crap what many researchers say is that the success rate of AA

357
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Pee is in the single-digit

358
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
One study show

359
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,679
That for every 100 people who show up in an AA meeting on January

360
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Only five

361
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,519
Of those people will be sitting there on December 30th

362
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,871
Of the same year

363
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
You call that the dropout rate is

364
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Is 95 /

365
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Percent

366
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
I was really surprised to find that out

367
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Not to be fair

368
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
I think we should be

369
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
We have to say that

370
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,999
Couple things like first of all AAA is it is a volunteer organizations

371
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Support group doesn't claim to be a treat

372
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,679
And also when you start talking about success rates that gets really squishy I mean if a person doesn't show up

373
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Today beating it doesn't necessarily mean that they're

374
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
Drinking and they may be doing just fine or perhaps they switched group they've moved him laugh really hard to sort

375
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Find your terms here

376
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Clearly AA is born

377
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:33,599
To a lot of people and that's something that actually Gabrielle Glaser found out last spring when she published an article

378
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
In the Atlantic

379
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Get laid all this out

380
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
When that article came out I received

381
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Thousands of emails

382
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,887
You are a horrible person you deserve to die I hope your kids get killed by drunk drivers

383
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
But so there was this article in the Atlantic in April

384
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
We talk to doctor willing Bryan Glazer mentioned in the article

385
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
Call somebody who believes more medication than 12 step

386
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
He said that when that article came out

387
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Since then our phone is

388
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Run off the hook

389
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
We got about half her calls from out-of-state

390
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
Is there anybody in North Carolina or in New York or in Texas or in California

391
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
Or where it is and they're desperate in the families are desperate

392
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
For an alternative and they can't find one

393
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:23,007
He says all this makes him think back about 30 years when I was a resident there was this debate raging

394
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,383
There was a big debate about depression whether people should be treated with antidepressants

395
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
Reset the debate completely shifted

396
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Can we go

397
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
It comes to Prozac

398
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
When we got

399
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,367
Prozac prescribed Prozac

400
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Suddenly had this drug that was a massive

401
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
Success Pond other drugs and in the process

402
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Changed how people

403
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Fundamentalist seed

404
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
And now most people

405
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Male get treatment for anxiety or depression

406
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
With antidepressants

407
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Compared to psychotherapy

408
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
Do you think we're heading in the same place with addiction

409
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
All We Are

410
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
We are there's no question

411
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
I do predict in 10 or 15 years will have a Prozac Moana

412
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,423
This is Jean Pelletier in Boston Massachusetts

413
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519

417
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

418
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
And I'm here because I need your help

419
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
And I request

420
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,911
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

421
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
About what we're calling tiny moments

422
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Brilliance

423
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,335
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

424
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

425
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Maybe it was the moment that I

426
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Kids started reading back

427
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Do you

428
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

429
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,976
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

430
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,840
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

431
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

432
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Anything to do with the test

433
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
If you have a story

434
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336

Record a short audio message for us

438
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

439
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Thank you so much

440
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
Very welcome back I'm Chad Roberts and if you know this music you already know it's the Brian Lehrer show on

441
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:14,016
WNYC good morning everyone this is the Brian Lehrer show at our own

442
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
Home station WNYC in New York very very popular

443
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Yes

444
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
To explain

445
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
We wanted a gut check

446
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Guess we've been hearing all these

447
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Things from experts saying that we're undergoing a c chains and I want to know is that actually happening out there

448
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
There in the world and the world is our local world is

449
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Who is Brian Lehrer listeners

450
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,896
It's your stories of What kinds of treatment you were offered and actually used for alcohol and substance

451
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,016
Abuse to ask the Brian Lehrer Timothy would help us out call us 221-2433

452
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
They helped us out

453
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,928
Radiolab hosts

454
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,072
And you believe we're in the midst of a cultural and medicinal shift for the way we both View and treat

455
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
People with addictions

456
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,544
Yeah we we bumped into a reporter a couple years ago who told us the story of a guy

457
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,152
Sort of summarized Amy O'Leary story about doctor Mason

458
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
He described a moment where the addiction just switched off

459
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Goodnight sir to summarize what the experts

460
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,880
Hold us maybe something is happening we weren't sure it's not sure it's a

461
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,464
I were curious to hear from people who struggle with substance abuse

462
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:32,864
I'm wondering what sort of treatments they've been offered if they have they seen pills like an L tracks owner Baclofen

463
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Have they use them have

464
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Have they worked

465
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
What's been the experience

466
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Show listeners

467
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
Just like that help Chad report this story

468
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
I'm calling from New Hampshire

469
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
There was an explosion of calls Ginger and male pack your on WNYC

470
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,864
I'm an alcoholic and an addict and I've been in recovery for 18 years

471
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,704
A lot of people who felt like this idea of a pill that can

472
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Treat addiction was

473
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Idiotic

474
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
Magical medication

475
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Closest to physical disease

476
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,296
They're all be cured but we also heard from a lot of people who head

477
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Just been offered these drugs

478
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
I was prescribed shampoo

479
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
Cut the Cravings Lincoln call

480
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,240
You just got prescribed addiction medicine

481
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
That morning

482
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
One way or another

483
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,456
He was excited as we're a lot of the colors in this category because

484
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Kind of means that they're just sick

485
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
They're not bad people

486
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
Not something that people choose even though it seems that way

487
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
Tomorrow in Manhattan near on WNYC hello tomorrow

488
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Hi-yah

489
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
One color called in

490
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
To say that

491
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
Her dad had a terrible time with Alka

492
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
What's the strongest

493
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
We were thinking about putting him in rehab or something but afraid of the stigma of it and my mom is a doctor squish

494
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Is working in the hospital

495
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,664
He told me that one day she took matters into her own hands and

496
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
He gave him injection shots of

497
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
Voltaren

498
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,184
You know the way we say it is like mold during a muscle relaxant not too dissimilar from Baclofen

499
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
And it work

500
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,608
One day like everything was okay and he was over it I mean it wasn't something that was controlling our lives anymore

501
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Let me ask you this

502
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,496
That's pretty strange emails again after the Brian Lehrer show we had so many calls

503
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,848
That he set up a Google voicemail and he talked with an additional 40 or so people

504
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
Eddie asked everyone do you feel that we're headed toward a sea-change where we're going to start

505
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
Treating addictions in the new way

506
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,648
I completely do you know you got a drug problem find a drug that fixes the drug problem

507
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,720
Is no pill that will make you want to put them drinks

508
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Hello Billy

509
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Today

510
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
Will you just introduce yourself tell me who you are

511
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
Yeah you can use my few can use my full name if you want my name is Billy Webb I am from Shaker Heights Ohio and Akron

512
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
Really live in St Paul Minnesota

513
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,408
Hey this is Andy so I'm talking to all those people on the phone Billy's

514
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,528
It was a story that I just kept thinking about over and over again until eventually we ended up getting him into the studio

515
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Remember

516
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
What it was like

517
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
The first time

518
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
That you had alcohol it was

519
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
The summer that I turned 16

520
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
And

521
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
I was a quiet kid

522
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
And

523
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
It's kind of a

524
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
Nerd you might say I was into

525
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,008
Computer games but then it took the tide sort of swelling and I got into music and most

526
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,800
Specifically punk rock in

527
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Sky

528
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
He says it was this time that he was

529
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Coming out of the shell

530
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
Learn how to play the bass

531
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,320
Practicing all the time I made these new friends and they started the band we were horrible

532
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,904
But we're willing to put ourselves out there and we started playing gigs and

533
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
I have done my first girlfriend at that time and I was very excited

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
And nervous to see her

535
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
So

536
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,656
I figured why not why not losing myself up a little bit

537
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
So one day he breaks

538
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
Into his father's liquor cabinet

539
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
Takes a couple shots of Mount gay rum

540
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,872
To be honest with you and I finally felt like I was myself

541
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
And it just felt like I was on top of the world and I could do anything and I had all these creative ideas that came to me

542
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
I wanted to talk to people

543
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
That's when things started to take off

544
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,208
By the time Billy was $24 becoming an entrepreneur

545
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
He was running his own business

546
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
What is a storage facility that he plan to convert into art spaces where we would have shows and maybe even a little small

547
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Record Shop

548
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,472
Thousand a relationship we had a dog

549
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,104
He was a new band that toured it was fun I can say that for sure I could even conduct business out of

550
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,640
The bar down the street

551
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,456
If I wanted to cuz the business line forwarded to my cell

552
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
But he said that it was also around this time

553
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
Have you started to wake up in the morning

554
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
With the shakes

555
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
But I remember

556
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Drinking beer in the morning in the bathroom

557
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
How much do you think you were drinking

558
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
20 drinks a day 25 sometimes

559
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
They usually the night before

560
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Before I

561
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Passed out or went to sleep

562
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:26,752
I would say you know I'm going to turn it around in the morning I'm going to I'm going to get out of bed and workout eat a full meal

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
And that never ended up happening

564
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
What eventually

565
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Did end up happening is that

566
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Billy s

567
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
For help both his mom and sister the

568
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,040
Flew Billy up to Minnesota where he checked into one of the best rehab centers in the Midwest

569
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
And when I got there looks like a

570
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,904
Small college campus I mean is very serene

571
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,976
Sort of peaceful setting very welcoming

572
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
He started going to group meetings started working out and was like

573
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Alright I was actually excited

574
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
I thought that things would turn around when I got back

575
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
But

576
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Within just a day of being back in Cleveland

577
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
And it was right back to where I was

578
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
20 drinks a day 25 sometimes

579
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
So I ended up back in treatment

580
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:11,040
We figured you know I just didn't do it right the first time so if we go back we'll get it right this time

581
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
And

582
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Once again

583
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
You know I

584
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Crash and Burn

585
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
This time not even in Cleveland

586
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
I had realized at the airport

587
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
Even make it to Cleveland

588
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
And he said this is just how things went

589
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
It was just the same old story of In and Out In and Out in the span of about 4 years time Billy tree

590
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:36,640
7 different treatment centers detox centers lots of AA meetings I want 210 meetings in

591
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,736
70 days I went to 28 in one week one time nothing worked

592
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,112
He says there's a a sponsor's with tell him you can do this so get it right so we leave those meetings feeling positive

593
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,720
Another liquor store I just consider myself a failure at this point of time that

594
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
I was never going to get better

595
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
And that led to

596
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
More more drinking

597
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
He said that he lost his girlfriend pretty much all his friends

598
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Got fired from his job

599
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
Due to drinking and my day is just consisted of

600
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Walking to the liquor store

601
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
Find 2/5 and walking home

602
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
That's all I did I just laid in bed

603
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
And and drink tart even

604
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Think about

605
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Without being completely horrified that that's with

606
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
My life has turned into

607
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
And then

608
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,488
I woke up one day with severe severe pain in my abdomen and I couldn't move or walk

609
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Or keep water down

610
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,888
And it was really scary and it was pancreatitis so I ended up

611
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,472
Checking myself into Hospital in Grand Rapids and

612
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,800
I saw these people and they said why we don't even we don't see

613
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
This condition until people are usually in there

614
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Mid-forties

615
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
Billy was only 29 years old

616
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
When I got out I moved into a sober house

617
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
St Paul

618
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
And that's what I got hooked up with

619
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
The Altier Clinic

620
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,256
No at the altar Clinic which I should say really quick is run by dr. Mark willenbring we talked to earlier

621
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,816
Are there they do something that they call evidence-based treatment

622
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
So if a patient shows up looking for help

623
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
They are giving a therapist

624
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:08,544
Did any underlying mental health conditions that they may have in for everything connected to their addiction

625
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
They're given medication

626
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,944
Into his case they gave him when I took them out strike zone

627
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
I actually was able to limit my drinking to

628
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
2 to 6 drinks a night which was

629
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
Quite frankly

630
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Felt like

631
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
The normal amount to me

632
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
He's able to drink

633
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Yeah

634
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Almost overnight

635
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
I was blown away

636
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,632
That's all I wanted was to be like everyone else who can

637
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
Write have a couple drinks in

638
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
Set it down what does that tell you that tells you that you are

639
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Q word

640
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
I just felt like there was

641
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
There is no compulsion

642
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Keep going and going

643
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,296
What was what was different than I did it did it not taste as good did it not as good

644
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,648
I can say that for sure especially if it was a microbrew or something like that

645
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
But

646
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
I didn't get that same brush in my head

647
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
And being able to drink without

648
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
That Rush

649
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
For a while

650
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
That made all the difference

651
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,704
Couple months I was okay you know now I can just have a couple

652
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
But

653
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
What happened was I

654
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
Was taking it and then on one weekend I just decided

655
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
You know what

656
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
You know what I'm not going to take it this weekend it's a long weekend

657
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
I don't need it

658
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,112
Listen to even though the urge to drink

659
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,696
Which was something that have been nagging at him for years even those that

660
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,024
Was now gone he told me that there was just some part of him that

661
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Miss

662
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Being drunk

663
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
If I wanted to

664
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
B2B intoxicated

665
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
Even with this medication that was

666
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Who's helping you

667
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
You missed it

668
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
Yeah knowing all that it cost

669
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Askew

670
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
What about it did you miss

671
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
I missed

672
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Feeling like myself

673
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
I didn't I

674
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,768
Hey guys this is for the engine I hate to interrupt but we have to

675
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
The studios

676
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Is being blocked

677
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
10 minutes of sorry guys

678
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,680
Poetically bad timing

679
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
We got

680
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
8 out of the studio

681
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
And this was this was several months back actually

682
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,200
And it took about another month and a half before we could all get back in the studio again Billy

683
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
Well yeah yeah

684
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
So I started by asking him so

685
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
When you said that

686
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
You didn't feel like yourself what would that mean

687
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
I didn't

688
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,024
Picture life being possible without alcohol that's the only person that I knew

689
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
And basically what he told me that if you

690
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Think back to the beginning of the story

691
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
He came out of his shell

692
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,264
Alongside alcohol being creative writing music performing music

693
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
Alcohol's are his verse

694
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Girlfriend alcohol

695
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
He's had drinking

696
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Associated

697
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Since puberty

698
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
With the best parts

699
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Themself

700
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,064
Angelique you know how we all have this sense of

701
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Like who we are inside

702
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
Again I have like giving your inner Jaguar like

703
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
People can think what they want about you and you got your Epic

704
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
Mutation

705
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
So you you know who you are.

706
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Will his

707
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
It was all wrapped up

708
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
And alcohol

709
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,216
Do you take that alcohol away what was left was

710
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,520
An empty guy that I didn't know

711
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Justice

712
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Boyd

713
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
And filling up that boy he says was this

714
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Onslaught of these

715
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
Terrible memories

716
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Sequestered

717
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Detox words and

718
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Punitive treatment

719
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
All the people I've alienated

720
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,928
Over the years all the Lost opportunities

721
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
And all the failed attempt

722
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
He says that's what he would think about when he was sober

723
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
And you just wanted not

724
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,960
Last time we talked to Billy he was doing really well I had the job I had

725
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
The girl I had a band back

726
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
But he says that in the course

727
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,104
I'm just as month-and-a-half since the last time we talked

728
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
Elastigirl isolated want your friends and lost it

729
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
Good job that I wanted to keep for a while

730
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Until I could get in the garage

731
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
It's cool so

732
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
Kind of having to start over now

733
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,952
Even just listening to your voice right now you sound so different

734
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,816
I know that I sound different because I was I was coming in here with more than

735
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Positive spirit last time

736
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
I really was flying high last time

737
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:27,360
People were excited for me to come in and now they're they said are you sure are you sure you want to come in today and talk to them

738
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
I mean

739
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
The pit of people who

740
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
Even talk to me right now

741
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
So

742
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
It's hard to do a triple backflip

743
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,440
Didn't want to come in here crying or anything but you know

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
It's pretty sad

745
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
It's pretty sad but

746
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
At the same time I mean I feel hopeful that I can beat this

747
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:57,312
I believe still seeing a therapist he still going out here he's actually on this new medication out called

748
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
Gabapentin what she says has been helpful

749
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,224
And I know I was pretty staunchly against to the 12 Steps last time

750
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
But

751
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
I am actually

752
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Going back to meetings

753
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
These days

754
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Just to be with people who are in the same boat

755
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Suicune buff

756
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Yeah

757
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
I hear story like that and I say

758
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,216
Yeah I think we're ready to see Addiction in the new way

759
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,568
And we're definitely I think pills will be a big part of that seems me

760
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
But

761
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
The pills can't get all the way down

762
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
You know

763
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
Write the duck thing that makes addiction go is

764
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Really deep

765
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Retin A

766
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
This reminds me of when we were talking to Nora volkow spine and director of the National Institute of drug abuse at the NIH

767
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
She's at a point that is

768
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
The same idea in a really interesting way one of the questions that I've always got in my brain is

769
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Why do we become a

770
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,776
Why is it that we can fall into a state where we actually

771
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,360
Become obsessed about something and compulsive

772
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
Despite the fact that

773
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
It can have negative consequences and

774
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Romantic love

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
He's exactly that situation

776
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Nora said that one thing that biologists

777
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
Snow in actually

778
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
I've known for a while is that

779
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Drugs

780
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,024
Hijack systems in our brain that are there for other purposes

781
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
She says literally

782
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
Drugs will light up the same circuit in your brain

783
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
That are usually engaged

784
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Take when you're in love

785
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
When you're hanging out with your friends when

786
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Now you're being hugged by your kid

787
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:38,176
Since it's almost like randomness of chemistry that you have this chemical compounds

788
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
That can go directly and activities

789
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Dissenters

790
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,856
So it hijacks the very things that make us

791
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Casino

792
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Good friends

793
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Good parent

794
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Correct

795
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
It's like a weakness point of a

796
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
The strength

797
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Yeah and actually

798
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
According to Andrews children so we talked to her earlier

799
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
People with addictions ironically

800
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
They're the fittest of the step in evolutionary terms right

801
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,920
They're the people who would have been earliest for the the food earliest for the sexual partner

802
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
There's a deep down inside of them

803
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
Like

804
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Level

805
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
They have the greatest sensitivity

806
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,368
They would be exquisitely attuned

807
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
To the promise of reward

808
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
And most of the time and for most of us

809
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
The Millennia all the priorities were on

810
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Being

811
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,912
A good reward appreciators that that was our only job

812
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
But now

813
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
When a different environment where we got

814
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,592
Huge opportunities for many sexual encounters that carry

815
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
Viruses rather than just

816
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,456
Another possibility of survival if it is then we've got

817
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
You know

818
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,624
Origins meals that we can acquire without expending a calorie and see in almost every circumstance that you can think of

819
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
Except for the last

820
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
You know

821
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
50 years

822
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,536
Being on the side of being overly responsive to reward

823
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Was probably mostly an advantage

824
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
You know

825
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
Hot sandwich I've never heard of

826
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
I said that way

827
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
And for patients

828
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
In some sense

829
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
They're the fittest of the fit

830
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
And think

831
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Sounds like a terrible

832
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
And the

833
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,272
Terrible reality of that joke is something that just

834
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
Kept showing up on her voicemail

835
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856
Over and over again

836
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928

Alcohol abuse last name

841

My son

844

He was a creep

845
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
I think he just couldn't
