1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:24,064
Okay so how we going to start this I think we should start with a

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
The first of all time

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,696
Is Radiolab and today we're going to start with our producer letter faster

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,512
Now you'll let me take you to

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
Biggest democracy on the planet

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
Yeah they did that you know in fact

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,888
Do you have mobile data

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
India

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
Over 800 million voters

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
And from 2010 to 2012 this guy is why she was in charge

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,600
The whole thing from 2010 to 12

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
And before that election commissioner for 40 years

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,232
She told me something that just astonished

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
They have this crazy rule to be within walking distance

17
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
Maximum to kilometers

18
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,520
So not a single of the 800 million + voter test

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
The travel more than a mile in a bit to get to a polling station

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,432
No matter where you are in that country that is India

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,272
This is true yes I have pulling sensation in the DeForest

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
The mountain Reddit

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,904
We danced to walk 13 or the way you can read that so you can try

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Helicopter party

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
On camels and elephants

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Unamused

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,376
Bicycle motorcycle

28
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
Which brings us

29
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
To the Gir Forest

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,568
We have a police station in DeForest

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
2 in Gujarati

32
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
There is a forest

33
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
And there is a temple priest

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Who lives inside a temple

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
Deep deep in this Forest

36
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
By himself

37
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
And so

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
What career

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Is every election

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,792
Keep send him into that Forest which by the way

41
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Is the home to the Asiatic lion and there are regular reports of lions actually attack

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Basically these guys

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
12 1/2 miles into the forest

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Dragging along with em diss voting

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Until they get to this

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
Like it's like a little Forest Outpost

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
They get there they sleep overnight

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
And then early the next morning to set up the polling station

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,208
And then they wait they just wait for this guy for him to come and work

50
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
And

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
There's actually a video on YouTube of this emerging

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
From the forest

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Te bote

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
His name is Muhammad

55
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Burrata

56
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,872
Darsh under is wearing traditional clothes that you know this long sarong type skirt

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
So he walks into this

58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Little station

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Fills out his ballot

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
Gets his finger painted with a little red. Right that's to make sure he doesn't vote twice

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,376
Which would be a little hard to pull off in the situation but anyway he filled out his ballot

62
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
And then

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
His boat

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
Get counted

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,248
This could be the most effort ever put into making us

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Single

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Personable

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
And this is done again

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Because no

70
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
Voting Indian should be denied a

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:47,072
Place to vote at a convenient location. It's a it's a kind of

72
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,216
Beautifully Noble idea why do you waste money

73
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
Because I believe that every single workout

74
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
But

75
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
It's not like that guys vote actually

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
You made it

77
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
Of course it may every

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
This is a beautiful

79
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,136
Have a vote vote make beautiful thing in

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,256
In principle but it's not vote actually is ever

81
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Decisive like one but never really makes

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,167
All the different you want one vote changes the world kind of thing

83
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
If not for that one vote

84
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Things would be dead

85
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
So I decided

86
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Dig around

87
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
End

88
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
This is the first thing I came

89
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
November 1996

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
The day before

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Clinton Dole presidential alert

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Okay and Landers

93
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Chicago columnist

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Writes in her column

95
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Dear readers

96
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Tomorrow is election day if you don't bother to vote

97
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
You have no right to complain about who gets elected

98
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,191
The essay that follows was sent in by a reader in Missouri

99
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
So here we got they were going to read and Landers as mail

100
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Basically

101
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,663
The whole thing cuz it's too long but it is most important

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Is one vote

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
In six

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
1845

105
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
One vote

106
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Dave Oliver Cromwell

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Troll of England

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
In 1649

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
One vote caused Charles the first of England

110
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
2 BX

111
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Oh my God

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
In 1770

113
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Sixth one vote gave America the English language instead of German in German

114
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
The two of us one vote brought Texas into the Union

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,151
One vote saved president Andrew Johnson from impeachment

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
France

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
From a monarchy

118
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,295
To Republic one vote gave Rutherford B Hayes the

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Residence

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
Sunshine

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
In 1923 one vote gave Hitler leadership

122
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,727
Now this is a pretty incredible in each case had the vote been missing the result would be different

123
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Write history would be

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
It's a wonderful place to

125
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Begin anyone who's thinking of not voting

126
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Consider this list

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,527
With kare-kare and once they go out and they research and they read their history

128
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
They will find it this lists

129
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Totally bogus

130
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
Bogus exaggerated mischaracterized

131
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
1645

132
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,423
1 volt David Cromwell control of England are you multiple this morning into one of them wrote to me that this was

133
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
This quote absurd there was a voting

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
1645 Cromwell was made

135
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Lieutenant

136
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
General of the Cavalry but

137
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
No one knows

138
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,247
The margin of that Vogue are you the next with Charles the first to be executed

139
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
According to another historian

140
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Complete nonsense over to us this next one one vote gave America the English language instead of German

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
I never heard of that there was a vote to translate

142
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
The laws

143
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
And then they decided

144
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Yeah I know maybe it's better.

145
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
How to do that

146
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,703
One vote brought Texas into the Union in the Senate

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
The vote was

148
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
27

149
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
225

150
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Too much

151
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Not 1.

152
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
And that wasn't even the decisive vote

153
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,247
The next one vote saved President Andrew Johnson from impeached

154
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
A jacket that was true

155
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
The guy who made that vote was bribed

156
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,487
Devote when he was bought that it was bought by moving on bed right one vote changed

157
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Plants from a monarchy to a

158
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Republic pressive but

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,471
You conveniently omit the fact that there were three Revolutions in the prior 80 years

160
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
One vote gave rutherford Hayes the presidency

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,199
So this is true ish disputed election so it went to the special committee

162
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
And he did win their by ones open it was more like

163
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Politicking that actually like voting

164
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
And last

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
One vote gave Adolf Hitler leadership

166
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Hardy in that case

167
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
The vote was actually

168
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
550

169
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
3

170
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
2 1

171
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
So he got this week

172
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Exactly right exactly wrong

173
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
So that concludes our lessons in journalism today when receiving letters from total strangers to Nada

174
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
Always assume that they know what they're writing

175
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
But it's like a bit

176
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
It's more than just a journalistic correction it's like this

177
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
Instantiation of everything you believe about the society that you live in it somehow your voice however little

178
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
It's important and its value

179
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
And for this all to be wrong

180
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Devastating

181
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
You know and then you you going to

182
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Distance not make me feel

183
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
For even a second that your vote is not valid

184
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
That's right

185
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
I don't know. It makes me want to put my money where my mouth is

186
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
And it's like spine you think one vote matters

187
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Prove it

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247

00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Friendly election commissioner Sy quraishi

210
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
You just tell it as it unfolded from your perspective

211
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Stocking 2008

212
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
Rajasthan the state that I was going for the election

213
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,791
Welcome to Rajasthan is this enormous desert

214
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
State in Northwest India with almost

215
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
75 million

216
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Nearly

217
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
2 caliber

218
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Forneus

219
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
And in 2008 they were going into their election

220
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:24,895
And still dr. CP Joshi

221
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Josie was

222
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
In his fifties

223
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
A member of the Rajasthan in Congress

224
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Representing the Congress

225
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
Party which is a little

226
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,695
Confusing I know but anyway over the past eight years he had been climbing the political ladder

227
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
And in 2008

228
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Public party

229
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
Gender perceptions

230
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
He will be the next chief minister

231
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
Which college did Governor so if he wins it's like

232
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
He'll be the governor of

233
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
75 million

234
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
What was your role

235
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
With respect to that particular election

236
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
I was one of the three-year election Commissioners and so

237
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
The day of the election arrives

238
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
CP Joshi Congress president

239
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,511
Cpj's Redmond

240
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
TB Joshua

241
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,751
Which may not be as big a surprise given the title of the episode

242
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
The final tally for the top two finishers

243
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
With 60 2216

244
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
260 2200m

245
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
15

246
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
I mean next sister

247
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Can that be but that's what he that's what he

248
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
TS right dude like a Joshi the incumbent it's like no no

249
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
Show me the questions on the postal ballot

250
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Like the mail-in ballot

251
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
What about 500% ballot

252
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,727
Unit 15 minutes recording with.

253
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Still lost by one vote

254
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Why is weird

255
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
Then he called up a second time

256
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,711
Requesting for the recirculating the totals from the machine

257
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
Meaning recounting all the electronic

258
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
Thousands of ballot adding them all by hand again

259
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
And then after that he lost his chief minister

260
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Nobody Love by one more

261
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Now that is

262
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,007
Brutal that is brutal to lose by 1 but it actually get to even more brutal and

263
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Personal because

264
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
People started talking about his wife

265
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Biblia

266
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Rumors went

267
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
On the day of the election

268
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
His wife had gone to a temple

269
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
To pray for

270
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
And because she was praying at the

271
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Temple she didn't make it to the polling station

272
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
She didn't vote

273
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
That's

274
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
What's the difference

275
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
That's a difference

276
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
He looks at his wife he can look as I say you didn't

277
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
Vote I didn't win

278
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
One causes the other

279
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
That

280
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
Certainly you can take given your family for granted

281
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
I said the other day of the pool

282
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
The most important Temple is the police station

283
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
The most important Temple

284
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Is the polling

285
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,863
But this is CP Joshi I am the person who lost by one vote

286
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Columns

287
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
To check this one. Because of

288
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Absence of anybody from my permit

289
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
My mother my wife my son

290
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
You mind if I talked to your wife a little bit and I was you sleeping with me tonight please give the telephone

291
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,087
Hello hello dr. Joshi you mind introducing yourself for me

292
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,719
Dr namita Joshi you definitely voted for and supported your husband

293
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Definitely

294
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Saigon Village

295
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
Totally wrong

296
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
A morning prayer Joe she's all this gossip

297
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Started because on the morning of the elec

298
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Dr. Joshi and his son went to

299
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,615
To vote there was a photo op at 1 take pictures when did photo

300
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Was Felicity TV

301
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,783
In-depth photo my wife my wife came from Jaipur and later in the day did go to the polls

302
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
I with my in-laws my mother-in-law and sister-in-law

303
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
So because

304
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
The picture of him and his son was on the news everyone thought so it's because his wife didn't though

305
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Hi CNN Landers was probably covering a simply announced while the wife didn't vote right but this is where

306
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Where things get even

307
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Stranger

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
There was actually another wife involved

309
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
You know that part of the story

310
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
Easter

311
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Mustard emetic

312
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
So I normally I don't even just that part of the Jody

313
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Am I supposed to go

314
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Shortly after the election

315
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,047
Some of Joshi supporters started coming to him and saying

316
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
Yeah and pretty quick and videography

317
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
They had proof that one particular woman had voted

318
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
Twice how do you vote twice voted at two different polling stations once under her married name and ones under her maiden

319
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Is the very very rare

320
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
What happened

321
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
And here's the

322
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
What advice

323
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
It was the wife of the man who won the election

324
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
And so glad I went for the election petition in high court and then Supreme Court and they ruled it was true she did fragile

325
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,983
Italy vote but then what because after all this week on DVD

326
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Did the word commode

327
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Equal

328
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Citizen Times

329
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
So what are they going to do that but to do what

330
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
What happened was it this investigation

331
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Actually took

332
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
4 years for them to figure all of this

333
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
The stuff out

334
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
And the term

335
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
That they were being liked is a five-year term

336
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,511
So then what happened did they did they let him serve out his term or did they

337
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
Let it be like this that said because you destroyed me that's expiring

338
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,935
If it was me I think I would be so bitter

339
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
But you don't

340
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Sound very bitter

341
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,383
First time it's your birthday is a blessing this guy first Reese's being defeated by his opponent who by the way we

342
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Reached out to but he was

343
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Sexy was not able to talk to us

344
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Being beaten by that

345
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Guy Joshi

346
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
She's it as a sort of blessing in disguise

347
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Sky Zone

348
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Because

349
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
6 months after his loss

350
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
There was a special election

351
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Not the

352
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
Street-level in Rodger time but the federal Universal like Indian level

353
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
So he ran for this election

354
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
And not only did he win

355
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
But eventually he got tapped

356
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
Tubete minister of railways

357
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
Which in India that's a big deal.

358
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Destiny I decided

359
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,455
Did I should do a lose by one vote Elijah Cummings government of India

360
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,343
Steve have not lost me one more time.

361
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
What does it mean how do you make sense of

362
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
I can only say that

363
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Everybody is important

364
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
That message goes above my erection English

365
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
So after we hung up

366
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
The phone our reporter and fixer no engine of almach who is

367
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Stop over on the other side with the Joshi

368
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
She just kept asking them questions

369
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
In this case

370
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
Do women wear matching Focus

371
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
I did my best positively but she did

372
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,471

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

397

And I'm here because I need your help

398
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,415
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

399
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Aunts and uncles teachers

400
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

401
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Basically I want to hear about this

402
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
I kid you know did something

403
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
It just means you read back and say

404
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Well

405
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month

406
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Started reading

407
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Back to you

408
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

409
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

410
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Or maybe the kids in math

411
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
Music in the margin of their geometry

412
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
We're interested in the

413
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Specific moments where

414
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
A kid does something super smart

415
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
It doesn't have anything to do with it

416
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
If you have a story

417
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447

426
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
When one vote

Maddie

428

And as promised

429
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
What's the next story

430
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
Certified to be fraud free

431
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Takes place

432
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
In Texas

433
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,831
So these are the property up on the right at a cattle ranch

434
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
Tiny cold shiney hiney

435
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
And the guy you just heard is

436
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Alan Russell

437
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
And I'm the Emperor of shiney hiney

438
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Shane

439
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Okay

440
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Explain I should back up a little bit

441
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
In 2009 Alan had just finished up grad school he was living in Dallas

442
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
With his parents

443
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Yep

444
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,343
Yep then one day I was actually on my way back from a ski trip

445
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
And I get a call from the man I know

446
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
You know he said he was looking for

447
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Somebody that needed

448
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,120
Change in their housing situation and had an opportunity to discuss

449
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
And so

450
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
I called him back

451
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
And he said I've got this Thousand Acre Ranch up north of Dallas

452
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
What's the time trying to develop

453
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Nothing up there right now.

454
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Cows in field but

455
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,176
I need someone to live up there for awhile in a mobile home

456
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
And if you do it

457
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
I'll make it worth your while

458
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
So for $150 a month I got a three-bedroom trailer with the kitchen in the living room

459
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,952
Room and bedroom and office and all that

460
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:55,840
You got his utilities paid for free internet and put in that satellite dish so I can get high speed in a

461
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
And he's like

462
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Yeah I'll do it handshake deal

463
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
And

464
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,800
The next thing I know you know he's ordering a trailer and I'm changing my residence

465
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Can you describe what it looks like it here

466
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
We got fields

467
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
As far as the eye can see

468
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
Ripley at Allen give reporter Stephanie kwolek with tour of the ranch

469
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
And for those cowpatty honestly it was refreshing

470
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
To do

471
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Campfire

472
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
Man gets hot I would go for a dip in the

473
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
The watering hole

474
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,096
If I didn't want to see another human being I could go

475
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Days or weeks

476
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,008
Without seeing another human beings probably in the biggest piece of shape and got

477
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
So if he's getting all these

478
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Goody's

479
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
What's his buddy to developer getting in return well well it is basically required me living

480
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,112
Up here as the only legal resident

481
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
In other words the only eligible voters

482
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Voting

483
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
What you going to vote for

484
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
So

485
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,632
Allen's buddy and his crew they want to put houses on this

486
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
The first they have to put in a bunch of utilities you know

487
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,568
Streets and sewers all things that normally taxpayers

488
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,432
Of course these guys are private businessman not a government that can Levy taxes

489
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
But according to

490
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,808
It's law property owners and residents can get together hold an election

491
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
And decide to create a

492
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Special district

493
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
It's like a tiny little government that can love you

494
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
Which would be ideal for these Developers

495
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
Is then they could just get a loan to build the streets and stuff

496
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,168
I didn't pay the loan back through that tack

497
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Problem is

498
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:43,616
There aren't any residents on this land there's no one to vote this whole deal into existence

499
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
In the first place

500
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
And that

501
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Is where Allen

502
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
Once he's living on this land

503
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
And pay the tax

504
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
So they told him

505
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,584
You can live up your cheap with all utilities and internet paid for

506
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
You just have to vote in this

507
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:10,240
Election didn't push me in any One Direction but it was

508
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
Clear one if there's one issue on the ballot there's a reason that one issues on the ballot and

509
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
Woman named Angela comes in she brings me my voting booth which is basically a little table it says like a

510
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,136
Folding table along with an electronic voting machine and a whole list

511
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
You have to open pause and 7 a.m. you have to close you have to be the election judge have to sign this things like that

512
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,656
Does that mean that this guy is going to be the motor in the election was going to run the election

513
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Can you go vote

514
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Manage his own vote

515
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
Exactly had to be aware of the perimeter and cuz if if somebody could come up with a

516
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
Political poster or something and tried to put that up within a hundred feet of the polling location I would have had to ask them

517
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
Stop

518
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Oh yeah

519
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Of course

520
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,816
I wouldn't want my kitty cats to know how I voted on that election

521
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,592
Get Arena and Lucius then Valley question because they were I was the election judge but they were my

522
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Pulling a cyst

523
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Even got name tags

524
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
So

525
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Day of the election

526
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Sun rising over

527
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
For the plains of Texas

528
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
Set up my music outside

529
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
What kind of music are you playing

530
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
Play House music

531
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
The crank the beats

532
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:45,472
Setup is voting booth standall legs plug it in Boots up

533
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:52,128
Hello you know whatever and I think it was like pre-programmed with the ballot

534
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
There is no worries

535
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Got a trailer dance music

536
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Cat's name tags

537
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Voting machine

538
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,440
Is this part I literally sat here from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. but then at some point he

539
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Cert makes a decision

540
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
What is the ballot look like

541
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,608
It was not as simple as yes or no

542
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
I want to say there were there like three or four parts to it

543
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Here in front of me

544
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Actually

545
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Have the

546
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Ballot

547
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:25,152
Okay weather Missouri proposition on several Proposition 1

548
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Literally just says District

549
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
For there's a box

550
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Against there's a box

551
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Shall we do this

552
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Exact

553
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
And then after that there's a section where he vote

554
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
What's in the board of

555
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,024
So there are so yes vote for 5 it's like a choose 5 of the below

556
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
And you have

557
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
1 2 3 4

558
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,192
There are only five candidates issues five people and there's a list

559
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
Volume up five people

560
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,128
And then this little government that I've just created one proposition ago will be able to

561
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,248
To borrow money and the people who live here afterwards

562
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Will a severe back

563
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
So Allen

564
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Voted yes

565
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
For everything

566
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:13,280
Yep or did it say what it was for or was it just like all know I know there was a dollar

567
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:18,144
Paramount and if I remember correctly I want to say it was

568
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,960
340 million dollars

569
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,056
240 it was something like that

570
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,944
371270000

571
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,016
Which means that the future resident

572
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
It's of this

573
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Property

574
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,928
Are on the hook for nearly four hundred million dollars

575
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Is this

576
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
Practice at this point there are

577
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
Right now at the moment I just got this email from the

578
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
The government there are

579
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:54,752
1237 of these types of Utility District

580
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
To cross Texas right now they cover

581
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
2.9

582
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Million Acres

583
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
So that's basically

584
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
To Delaware's and according to the Houston Chronicle you've got two million Texans right now

585
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Living

586
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
It is kind of utility

587
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
How much money has been raised

588
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Jamaica's government

589
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:18,304
Ballpark figure again from Houston Chronicle okay outstanding debt

590
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Of these types of utilities disk

591
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
60

592
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Billion dollar

593
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
60 billion billion dollars

594
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
60 B billion

595
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
This feels

596
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Wrong to me

597
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Like these

598
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Taxes

599
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
What created by individuals

600
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
Who squatted on property

601
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
For a while and mostly laugh

602
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
Didn't have to pay the

603
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
It just feels a little unfair to

604
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,464
To me anyway for the people who will live there when they will pay the

605
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
The taxes and never go

606
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Got to vote

607
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,608
If somebody you know lives in their $300,000 house

608
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,984
And every year that they have to pay $3,000 in tax

609
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
That they wouldn't have if I had not

610
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Voted the way that I did

611
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Would they resent that

612
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Maybe

613
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
But

614
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,576
People complain about about paying their taxes

615
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:17,184
And yet they get in the car and they drive on the road that's supported by federal tax

616
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
Dollars

617
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Dysuria

618
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
This is Republican state senator Jane Nelson

619
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
And she argued that these

620
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,240
Fish and chips but way too much power in the hands of a single voter

621
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
When she brought the committee a bill

622
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
That would fix

623
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
The problem

624
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Is required minimum

625
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
40 Motors

626
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,968
Basically she said these election should require no fewer

627
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
10:45

628
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
Which would help ensure the actual residence

629
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Community wild horses

630
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
But at least for now the state legislators in Texas have decided

631
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
They're all you need to pass

632
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
The tax of this kind is one vote

633
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
That's the story

634
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
Wework coming to celebrate

635
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:19,392
One vote matters in a glorious wave the flag sort of like

636
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Not enough

637
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
Fraud in India and

638
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,048
And taxation without representation what I wanted

639
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
You wanted some yay or something okay I have one I have one more I have one final score

640
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Real good

641
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
And why don't you

642
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Come with

643
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
Why don't you do this

644
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
That you make me happy

645
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Yes

646
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
Come with me let's figure it out

647
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
Now y'all in New York

648
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:51,648
I'm going to put on my most southern accent now

649
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Alright so this is Carol Busey

650
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
And I'm Robert so we let the frobert in Tracy

651
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Okay

652
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,008
Hi. By the way is a reporter and producer Tracy hunt

653
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
It's a three-on-one

654
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,640
Well you know we southern girls we can handle anything

655
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Carol is a professor of history at the volunteer state Community College in Tennessee near Nashville

656
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,880
Well do understand that Nashville is now the it

657
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
City

658
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
Seems to be

659
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
But for our story there was a moment in Nashville

660
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
History is not just the it

661
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
City it was the

662
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Laugh

663
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
Stand in a long and vicious

664
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Struggle

665
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,984
For women to get the right to vote

666
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,056
It was the summer of 1920

667
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,504
That's a real history recording of a 101 year old woman and Abby Crawford Milton

668
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
Who in that very hot summer 1920

669
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Descended upon their

670
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
I spell with hundred and hundreds of other

671
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,976
Suffragists like herself anti-suffragists

672
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Lawyers

673
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Politicians

674
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
Business people they all came to Nashville for the

675
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Legislative battle

676
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Okay

677
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
Now let me stop here and take us one step back

678
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Okay

679
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,552
And we're also going to bring an historian Jill Lepore history at Harvard

680
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,160
She told us that at the end of the Civil War 1865

681
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:32,512
Congress was considering this new amendment to give former slaves the right to vote

682
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Yeah the small band of women who work

683
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Wishing hoping

684
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,400
Fighting to be included in this new event

685
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Women expect

686
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,240
The Fourteenth Amendment is going to lift

687
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Any

688
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,336
It discrimination within the constitution on the basis of

689
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Race

690
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Color or sex

691
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
And why would they think that since nobody was

692
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
Saying let's do this for the women of Gettysburg or at Antietam or what they had been the stalwart

693
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
Ernest and women are really important of the founding of the Republican party and so when they say they know y'all can you guys going to do the cement off

694
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:09,376
Obviously you're not going to forget it's right like we're going to write this political Ramos do it like let's just do it let's get this

695
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,704
Done this proposed amendment is being talked about in Congress being

696
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
Perfected as being tweet and

697
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,568
It's about to come to a vote when almost at the last minute

698
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
The word mail is put in there

699
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Amending Amendment so that only men can

700
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
And it's

701
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
The first introduction of the word male into the Constitution

702
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
So not only

703
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Does Apple 18th Amendment

704
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Spell

705
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
To guarantee women their citizenship

706
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
And the rights of come in

707
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Privileges become a citizenship

708
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
It's specifically

709
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,912
It's real right we're starting back at

710
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
Square one so

711
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,848
At that point some women are like God damn it like all right we're just going to go vote and so for instance

712
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,504
Actually tries to vote they won't let her goes to the Supreme Court I guess you won't be surprised to hear you on the edge of your seat

713
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,856
What are we going to do I can't wait to do it.

714
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Is it raining right now

715
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:09,536
Ladies it's so cute that you thought you were included in the Cubs

716
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
No no no no no

717
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
We love you but no

718
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:18,240
And then in 1878 Susan B Anthony proposed another amend

719
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,640
Address for the right to vote people laughed about it and then put it aside for the next 40 years

720
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Has no movement

721
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,968
At all on this amendment

722
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,760
June 4th 1990

723
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Just after World War 1

724
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
After centuries of

725
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Suffering suffrage

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,208
Both houses of Congress finally passed the 19th Amendment

727
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
To give women the right to vote

728
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Amendment came after months of women protesting

729
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,704
Outside the White House and years of working jobs that before the war it only ever belong to men

730
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
But

731
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Force it also came with a constitutional

732
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,080
Catch it had to go to the state

733
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
To be ratified

734
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
Was just means that each state had to vote to approve it

735
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,808
Three-fourths of the state legislatures have to ratify the amendment

736
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,416
Well 36 in this particular instance had to vote for it

737
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:14,560
Now they got Wisconsin Illinois Michigan and then after that it's just like dominoes

738
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,888
Then we got to 35 States

739
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
And

740
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Stopped

741
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
It just got

742
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Stuck at 35

743
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
Knowing that the suffragists were only one vote shy

744
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
The anti-suffragist

745
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Beefed up their camp

746
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
At which made it

747
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
Harder and harder to get that final

748
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
Allstate it was looking grim

749
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
Until

750
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
There was a Wednesday

751
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Just one state that seemed

752
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
Like it might be.

753
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Teetering

754
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,752
August 1920 Nashville Tennessee legislators from all over the state start arriving at Union Station

755
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
Dirt immediately

756
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
Roane

757
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Anti

758
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Suffrage

759
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,456
Kind of pain either a yellow or red rose on their lapel

760
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Tell everybody

761
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
Across town would know which side they stood on that was Tom vikstrom he's The Unofficial historian of the very places

762
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
These legislators were headed

763
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
The most fashionable place in town

764
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
The Hermitage Hotel

765
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
Picture of the lobby there in the month of August

766
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,912
Swarming with people both Pro and anti suffrage

767
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
Women cooling themselves

768
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Palm leaf

769
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,360
Fans and of course no air conditioning man smoking cigar smoking politicians

770
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
Turn on the second floor mezzanine you have the headquarters of the anti suffragists and it's actually worth noting that a lot of the end

771
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:44,416
Anti suffragists were women campaigning actively against the right to vote

772
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:49,280
Suite 309 you have Carrie Chapman Catt leader of the pro suffrage

773
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,912
She had no children and her husband had died she had devoted all of her Energies

774
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,192
Towards this

775
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
One goal

776
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Getting women the right to vote

777
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:04,640
So she's up she's the big Washington to Bigfoot from Washington is really much like

778
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
A general

779
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,040
Who is both groups are there because this hotel is just a few blocks away from the State House

780
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,392
And they are trying to convince as many Tennessee legislators as they possibly can

781
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
To come over there so it was all kind of high Jinks and you name it eavesdropping

782
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Holograms

783
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,216
Are fake phone call messages

784
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,336
Are running around trying to stop these legislators from leaving town

785
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
There's a room back at the hotel called the jack

786
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
Daniel's room where there was some Jack Daniels being dispensed

787
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
By the anti-suffrage people

788
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
And supposedly Pro suffrage legislators

789
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,208
Could be heard through the hotel walls singing anti-suffrage song

790
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,840
Tennessee is supposed to be dry

791
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,472
And yet the aunt has are flagrantly violating prohibition

792
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
By having these events

793
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,616
In which the liquor flows quite well

794
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,600
The closer and closer they got to the final day of voting it became apparent that paper

795
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
People who had come to town saying they were in favor of ratifying this amendment wearing yellow

796
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,816
LaRosa's started wearing red

797
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Roses

798
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,960
On the morning of the final vote

799
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
So many

800
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,640
Red roses to yellow roses to yellow roses to red roses flip-flopping floppity flipping around

801
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,992
Bit by this point no one had any idea what was going to happen

802
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
That's exactly right way to stop you here for a second

803
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,928
Sure is it now clear to everybody that if the legislature of Tennessee

804
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,280
They will become part of the US Constitution

805
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
Absolutely absolutely you know you didn't have any cushion states that you could go to

806
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
You know

807
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,264
Nevada next there were no cushions

808
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
It's now or it's going to be a long time

809
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,200
And finally is going to happen one way or another

810
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
On August 18th

811
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
So the morning of the vote

812
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
The hotel starts emptying out

813
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Everyone heads over to the state capitol

814
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
But misses cat because she was going to be looked at as an outside agitator

815
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Headed to stay behind

816
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
In the state capitol in the house

817
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Chamber

818
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
Hot and humid in the room is

819
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
HAC

820
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664
The 96 legislators are settling at their desks and above them in the gallery around the top of the house

821
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Lost chamber

822
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Stand with suffrage

823
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,552
Why are there along with the anti suffragists

824
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,392
And you can be assured that both sides have their little pads

825
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
Enter counting the votes

826
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
And if they look at the Roses

827
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
There are 48

828
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Yellow roses

829
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
In 48

830
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Red roses

831
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,264
And all these roses reliable I mean

832
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,384
If you're wearing a red rose you're going to vote against it before the voting even begin

833
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
They can see that

834
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
We've lost

835
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
And yeah cuz you have to have a few have to have a majority

836
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
And the Speaker of the House

837
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,720
He had initially supported suffrage but he's really on the side of the ant Eyes by this time

838
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:36,096
And before they really start the vote he actually steps down on the floor

839
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,192
To give a speech against ratification of the amendment

840
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
So you know

841
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
There's another let-down you know

842
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
Is lost we've lost we've lost

843
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
And two blocks away

844
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Suite 309 of the Hermitage Hotel

845
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,248
Tits Carrie Chapman Catt

846
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
She was very nervous about what was going to happen

847
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
So what you going to do

848
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,208
She said there is only one thing left to do

849
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
We can

850
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Pray

851
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
So they start

852
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
The Roll Call

853
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
And as

854
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
These names are called

855
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
1byone these men stand up

856
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Invoice Turbo

857
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,024
If they are wearing a yellow rose

858
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
You say I for women's suffrage

859
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
They're wearing a red rose

860
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
They say nay

861
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
And among these legislators

862
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:53,663
It's a young man Harry T burn a republican legislator

863
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,015
From Niota Tennessee a 24 years old he's the youngest

864
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
Legislator in the house

865
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Small man

866
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
Little glasses with a serious face

867
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
The air is tense

868
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
I'm still

869
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Until

870
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Harrington

871
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
The young man

872
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Stan's

873
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
From his dad

874
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
A red rose in his lapel

875
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
But in his pocket

876
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:23,359
He had a letter from his mother over there in Niota

877
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Dear son

878
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
We've had nothing but rain since you left

879
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
Her name was Fab burn

880
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,343
Uncle Bill and mr. Bushnell came over this p.m. State about an hour

881
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
They were in the Ford

882
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
We haven't had that car out since you left

883
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,023
And if this rainy weather doesn't let up I fear we'll all have to

884
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,887
The stay-at-home the rest of them really it's just this ordinary letters Tower of what I'm writing

885
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
From a mom to her son

886
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,263
He was real sick yesterday but was better this morning

887
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
She's been complaining all summer tucked into all of those mundane details about lice in Niota

888
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
There was this little motherly

889
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Dig

890
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Aprotic

891
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:10,207
I've been watching to see how you stood but haven't seen anything yet you know son I've been reading about the suffrage fight in the paper

892
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
Prison Everly unchain your name anywhere

893
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,631
And then she says don't forget to be a good boy and help Miss Thomas cap

894
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Vote for suffrage

895
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
And don't keep them in doubt

896
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
With lots of love Mama

897
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,103
Harry T burn is wearing a red

898
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Rose

899
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
And his vote

900
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
Cheap boats

901
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
4

902
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
Women to have the right to vote

903
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,695
So up there in the balcony

904
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,279
There's just a moment of silence what's going on here what's going on

905
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
You can imagine

906
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
She can imagine this

907
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
And then it Dawns on you

908
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
Hey Harry changed his vote

909
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,287
It's not going to be 48 248 it's going to be 49 247

910
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,175
The suffragist you can imagine our crying

911
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
The anti Tsar Furious

912
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
You can imagine the total

913
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
Chaos here in this situation but there must be an awful lot of attention paid to Harry Wright Lake

914
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,487
The legend is that the anti

915
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
Start chasing Harry

916
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
Through the house chamber

917
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,167
Harry is completely undone oh my gosh what have I just done

918
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:29,567
So he jumps out of window not nash not jumping out of five story running but he gets out of the building and

919
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Jimmy's down the ledge to the

920
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
State Library which is in the same building

921
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,759
Where he gets in the window there and mrs.

922
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,367
More the librarian Mary Daniel Moore hides him in the stack

923
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
Until the storm blows over

924
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Now that's the legend Harry really climb out of that window and he

925
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
Shimmying happen

926
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
We don't know

927
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,215
How exaggerated that part of the story

928
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,383
The sounds from the hill carried all the way back to the Hermitage Hotel

929
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,759
Mrs. cat could hear them from her window she knew they'd won

930
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,599
It was in fact pass

931
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
The certificate of ratification

932
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207

933
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487

By the Secretary of

935
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
The final tally was actually

936
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
5240

937
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
After Harry changed his vote

938
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423
When other lights

939
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Just later switched sides but

940
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
It was clearly because Harriet Janet

941
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,103
First that's right to vote was the wreath at vote

942
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,455
Became the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution

943
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,527

944
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063

With a brave and honest son

950
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,607
Whatever the enemies of justice and decency made do now to show their vengeance upon him

951
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
He's bound

952
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655

Well is political career ended rather short

956
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,247
But you know he took his mother's advice

957
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271

958
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
He did get his name of the paper did me

959
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
You think about it the difference between

960
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
Tween men and women as voters

961
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
