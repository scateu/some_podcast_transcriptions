So how did you guys ever find out about

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
How to get into it

21
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
I think it was somebody was reading about it

22
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
This is manoush zomorodi

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
Was we are we with you reading about it right

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
MSR producer Alex goldmark

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
His name is McNutt

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,784
Name at least

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
And dimes please

28
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
Like we actually read it and it was

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Weird an interest

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Staying and brought up

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Lots

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,072
Technology is remaking what is possible for individuals

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
And for institutions and for the international order

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
Young Jedi runtime rubber Co which is Radiolab so here we are at this moment in time where we at we are face

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Eastwood these decisions

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
About what we want our future to

37
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
To look like

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,552
There are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
That place is

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
A special obligation on us to ask question

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
About what

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
Should

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
With our friends down the hall manoush zomorodi and Alex goldmark there in a great podcast called

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Note to self pay will be our guides

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Into the world

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,032
Of McNutt yes my name is Ross McNutt

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Sub McNutt

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
If I refer to him

49
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
He's an ex-military guy 20 years in the Air Force I enjoyed it

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
I did a lot of good like combat military

51
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Yah mean

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
I think he's actually special

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,160
My background I've got a PhD in Rapid product development out of MIT

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
And what I do is I teach young people how to build new systems

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,168
And the new system that's a system that we want to talk about that kind of began in 2004

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Ross was teaching a course at a Military College

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
Was that the Air Force Institute of Technology here in Wright-Patterson

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
Shannon Dayton does one day in 2004

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Are the whole school gathered together

60
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Pharrell

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
And our commander got up in front of the whole school and said we need to do something

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
To help the war effort

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
Terrible violence today in the city of Basra

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Cut that time in the Iraq War not going well

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Buildings in city streets

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
IEDs going off

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
All over the place is going off everywhere soldiers being blown up

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Weak I got blown up

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Recon

70
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
Going to be honest with you in 2004 it looks like we are going to lose

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Psoriasis he gets together some of the students on his colleague and they decide Lena let's sit down and see if we can find

72
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
Find a solution quickly find a solution

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
To figuring out who is planting all these roadside bomb

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Yeah

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Bombs going off of pretty easy to detect

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
And images

77
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
The problem is

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
How do you go from

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Bomb going off

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
Backwards in time

81
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
To be able to figure out who planted it

82
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
So

83
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Somehow

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
It just came out

85
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Are you guys sitting around

86
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
It was at a bar

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
We're working on the back of the napkin

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
And withdrawing out different ideas and turning around and seeing what happens

89
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
They're just like hey let's he's playing just try this let's try that

90
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
They had this one stock and we sort of

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Through this out on the back of an MBA

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Making it

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Took a little while

94
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
38 students working

95
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Confirm me for 2 years

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
But eventually they developed what became known as

97
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Project Angel Fire

98
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Outwork you take a small plane and on the belly of the

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
The plane they hook up his array of cameras

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Start the camera system we design and build

101
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Super hayat

102
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,231
Then the pilot

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Takes off

104
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Flies the plane High over Fallujah

105
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Military we were up at about 15 to 16 thousand feet to stay out of the Missile Range

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,663
On the ground in Fallujah and I look up what would I say

107
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
You wouldn't see us

108
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
You wouldn't hear us or you wouldn't see us

109
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Over Fallujah circle circle circle

110
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Click

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Click

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Click

113
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,447
Click every second takes a still image of the entire city of Fallujah 25 square miles

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
And then teams it down to an operator we take a picture

115
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Process it Down Lincoln

116
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Processing

117
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Down like it

118
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Every single second

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
To the plaintiff snapping picture after picture after picture

120
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
Pictures what makes the system so powerful

121
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,623
The operator on the ground has what say an entire day's worth

122
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,951
Of the high-res pictures of the entire city of Fallujah

123
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
I don't say there's an explosion people were killed in explosions at a market

124
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
11 others

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
First the operator would pull up the most current image of the

126
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
Zoom into the place with in Fallujah where it happened

127
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
And then click

128
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Click click

129
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
In one second increments go back in time

130
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,759
And see who was there what happened the last time somebody fiddled around in that

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
Yeah you like okay I might have gone back to ours and

132
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
It's bat car

133
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Fast forward

134
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Click the canal follow that car forward

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
In time

136
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
To see where it goes

137
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
You see that it went to

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
House in another neighborhood 2 miles away

139
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Well that's where you dispatcher Troop

140
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
Right then basically we be able to send either the Special Forces then I the Marines in

141
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Intuitive

142
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Take a program

143
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,807
Now look the military doesn't really statistics on how well some of its

144
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Military technology works

145
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,927
But there are officers who will be quoted saying that yeah

146
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Project Angel Fire

147
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Saved

148
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
But the reason why we decided to do the story is because it's not just a military thing right like with a lot of

149
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
These Technologies they maybe start in the military

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
But then they trickle down all the way down

151
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Dollar bus

152
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Actually in this case

153
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Trickle-down

154
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
To Dayton Ohio

155
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Ross Group Incorporated

156
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,207
Yeah be weird producer and emails and I actually went to Dayton Ohio

157
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
To visit Ross

158
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
At his best

159
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,887
Persistent surveillance systems persistent surveillance

160
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Rite Aid pills

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Orwellian

162
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
These are the lenses and the motors here basically control it

163
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
The first we went over to his Workshop where he actually works and makes the camera

164
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
These are more powerful than some of the best military systems

165
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
Like we could see him actually making them and how they get attached to the bottom

166
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
The airplane

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Oh so many airplanes

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Then we went over to the hangar where he has all the airplanes

169
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Beautiful dobro

170
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
27 airplane

171
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
He owns his own Airport

172
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Yeah

173
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
After you guys

174
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
Oh my God it's big and then he showed us their Command Center

175
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,127
And this is where you have a bunch of people sitting in front of these enormous screen

176
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
This is like your viewing room

177
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Yeah and this is where all the

178
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Plane pictures end up

179
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Because Ross is basic idea and taking this technology from Fallujah to a city like Dayton Ohio

180
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,047
Basically this is just as large a problem

181
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
As we doing

182
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Afghanistan and Iraq

183
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Only it's not IED zits

184
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Pride major events this year we've had four officer-involved shooting so far this year are homicides

185
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,663

00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
A year but McKnight is like for the out the price of a police helicopter we believe that we would be able to decrease

195
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Crime by 30 to 40

196
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Percent

197
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287

198
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335

199
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
The Dayton Police were like

200
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Basically setup

201
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Attest

202
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783

Hip Hop

205
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Just see for ourselves

206
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
What it was capable of doing

207
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Isn't the plane up in the air

208
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Started doing a thing

209
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Buju

210
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
And within just a few hours

211
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
There is a

212
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Call of this a breaking entering

213
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
In progress

214
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,431
Description of an older white box truck just a regular Brandon moving truck

215
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
This is Angie horn

216
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
She's the one who called 911

217
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Almanor lunch break

218
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
And she

219
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
She see the moving van

220
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Pull up in front of her neighbor's house

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Guy gets out

222
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Breaks in

223
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Start smoothie

224
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,583
Are we meeting we immediately called the police and they got their relatively quickly from what I remember

225
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
He had already taken off

226
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
Now normally in a case like this the police would be like

227
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Well how do we follow

228
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
We don't know where he went

229
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
But in this case

230
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
The police contact persistent surveillance systems

231
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
Alex blasingame I'm the senior analyst for the company

232
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Words about 5 minutes until he sees this little grainy white. Appear in front of her neighbor's house

233
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Is the vehicle here that we're wanting to Trackside what vehicle I don't I barely see anything so the image looks blurry

234
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
But the human brain in the human eyes are very very evolved to pick out movie

235
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,127
You got to understand that from two miles up a car looks just like a random shape

236
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
People they look like

237
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Alex has trained himself to

238
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Pick out Lube

239
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
How to put a tag down and where he's at places in Orange Circle over that random little shape

240
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,207
And then quickly quickly moves forward forward forward follow him to his real time location

241
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,351
Alex follows it up some roads finds out that it is parked in a parking lot six blocks away he calls up the people in the field

242
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Does go over there they get there they see the guy

243
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Is your truck full of stuff

244
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
They send different cap over to pick up the witness

245
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Witness Goes yep that's the guy

246
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Yeah this is minutes later

247
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
No kidding

248
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
That could have been a murderer

249
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Right I could have been armed robbery

250
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
I could have been a lot of things

251
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Sings this is so weird just like having a superpower but it is actually better than Batman you can't go back for the

252
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Time

253
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Superhero

254
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
I just feel sad

255
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
It's like

256
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
We're all just these little dots

257
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
It just seems like the antithesis of what a lot of

258
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
Police Department seem to be trying to do in the aftermath of

259
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Other

260
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Horrific things

261
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
To have happened

262
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Which is

263
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Getting the police

264
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
On the streets

265
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Making personal connections

266
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Creating relationship

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
There's nothing in this cyst

268
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
It prevents you

269
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
I'm having effective

270
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Community policing

271
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
At the same time

272
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Battle by the way this Major Medical

273
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Please help

274
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
That community relations

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
The reason they're putting body cams on police officers

276
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Is try to get the police officers to be

277
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
More respectful

278
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Because they can be seen

279
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Well this let's

280
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Watch all the

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
25 squared

282
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Area

283
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
But then you can watch so many other people

284
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
Here's other things that people in Dayton do

285
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Like Romeo and Juliet they sometimes meet

286
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Without their parents permission

287
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
The playground

288
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Smooch

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
There are going to be divorce lawyers or going to be

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
We tracking Aaron spouses there are going to be

291
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Traffic police

292
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,079
Watching who goes through the red light there going to be Realtors were wondering who are how many tenants do

293
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
You really have in that building and I guess

294
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
This thought might beat it

295
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
If the information exists

296
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
That will show what my pixel was actually doing

297
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
Then then I'm a little less

298
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Free

299
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
There is a a clear trade-off between

300
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Security and privacy

301
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
And you know

302
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
In our major cities where we have

303
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Tens of thousands

304
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
The major crime

305
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
You are a lot less free when you can't leave your house

306
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Is obviously a

307
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
A huge advantage

308
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
To knowing what you

309
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
You know

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
But then you say

311
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Huge

312
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Ping

313
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
To knowingly

314
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Like knowledge itself is sort of

315
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Is pregnant with

316
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Funny

317
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
You know what here's my problem

318
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Potato

319
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
Was it all of these privacy

320
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
It's like when you talk about these Technologies

321
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
Advantages are always so concrete

322
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
And the trade-offs

323
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Always feel so happy

324
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Extract

325
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,055
I feel like there is there certain there's something being lost here but I can never quite put my finger on it

326
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Twitter

327
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
Oh Dad that weirdness that you're feeling

328
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
It's

329
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Can I get

330
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Blue Rat Pack

331
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

337
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,063
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

338
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

339
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

340
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Brilliance

341
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,423
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

342
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,031
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

343
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,151
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

344
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

345
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,927
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

346
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
We're interested in the

347
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Specific moments where

348
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,863
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

349
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167

356
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Eyes in the sky

357
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
In the situation we left it is at mnuchin one of our producers and emails have gone down to Dayton Ohio to talk with Ross McNutt

358
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Check out his technology

359
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
How are you feeling

360
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
I was feeling like

361
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,647
You have not convinced me I do I am not

362
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
And then I saw was Max

363
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
And that

364
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Well

365
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
I mean that's what made me start to think otherwise

366
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
Where is especially the time we did this the average

367
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
300 murders a month

368
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
52 kidnappings a week

369
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
300 murders a month

370
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
McNutt the gang they got a contract we've been asked not to say

371
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
For home

372
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,063
And they went down south set themselves up in a hotel room got the plane up in the sky and then whoever the

373
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
Client was started bringing them crime reports

374
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
So this is kind of what you never want to see happen but

375
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
This is kind of why the system was up

376
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,887
Alex pulled up on the screen is very grainy aerial shot of Juarez

377
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
This is where is Mecca

378
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
It looks like

379
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Right you've got like grids of streets

380
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,335
Cars and houses and then like over on the left of the screen

381
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Key points to this dark little square

382
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
The vehicle

383
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
It's going down the

384
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
This is a female police officer she was X

385
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Headed to work

386
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
On this morning

387
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,487
All kind of go through it here

388
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
There's her house

389
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Your car is parked outside

390
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
You see that like

391
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Noodle pixel gets in her car

392
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,519
She pulls out of her driveway that was her home starts to drive to work

393
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
And then right when

394
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
She leaves

395
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
If you look up here in the upper left

396
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Several cars were parked

397
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Up on the corner

398
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Soon as you left your driveway those cars be

399
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Become active

400
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
So this is a Stakeout

401
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Yeah they were waiting for her to leave

402
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,303
He's so zoomed in that you can see it's like a Tic Tac

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
Moving down the street

404
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,911
And then two more Tic Tacs come alongside

405
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,055
Until they get right about here looking forward on the photo and you see

406
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
These cars just inch closer

407
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
What kind of hesitate there which is

408
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Unfortunate

409
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
So she's driving down the street

410
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
And there's these cars following behind her

411
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
And then

412
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
There's this car up ahead of her

413
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
A vehicle that had been

414
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
I'm parked here for

415
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
15 20 30 minutes

416
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
All the sudden

417
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Backs out into traffic

418
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,119
And seemingly slows them down almost gets in an accident right here

419
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Which gives these guys

420
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Enough time

421
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
To catch up

422
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
This is where they

423
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Pull up beside her

424
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
And then suddenly

425
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
Alex says

426
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Right there this is the point

427
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
Where the first car pulls up and shoots her multiple times she was shot in the head multiple times in the head right

428
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Right here

429
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,839
She's actually going to roll through the intersection

430
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
Her car continues to go even though she

431
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
She's been shot in the head

432
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
Had there's a parked car behind this tree

433
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
And you actually see this

434
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Parked car move

435
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
When she runs

436
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
And then these guys

437
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Takeoff

438
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
It was

439
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Not fun

440
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
To watch it was

441
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
But

442
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
What happens next

443
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Maybe

444
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
Really start to understand what this

445
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Technologies

446
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Real quickly

447
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Show you some of the

448
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
Ross walks in he takes that moment

449
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
Horrible moment and then he starts to like shoot back and forth in time

450
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,663
Before the murder hears his path after the murders

451
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
The two cars from that murder and you see he draws on the map you see that they meet up with two other cars

452
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
See that guy there that were involved in a different now one murder becomes two two cars become four

453
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,839
Stop and if you follow all four of these cars drawing lines as they move through the city

454
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
You find out who they meet up with him for becomes KAIT8 becomes so on and so on and you have all these

455
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,591
These lines crisscrossing the city and then you see that a whole bunch of those cars

456
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Are headed to one play

457
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
This house

458
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
This house appears to be there cartel headquarters

459
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
And

460
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
That's when you start to think

461
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,439
Well that's how you have to take something like

462
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
This town

463
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
It's not

464
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
A One-Shot thing like solving the crime

465
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
It's about

466
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
Cracking an entire system

467
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
In fact

468
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
This is Andy here at the when I was

469
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Doing some research

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
Into this

471
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,383
I'd be able to calls and I spoke with this one government

472
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
Who told me that this information that rosset

473
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Showed us

474
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,783
It was one of the primary tools

475
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Used to dismantle

476
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
An entire cartel

477
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
War is in that

478
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Apparently

479
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
The leader of that cartel

480
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
Was responsible

481
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
Something like

482
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
1500

483
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Murders

484
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
Cigarettes again so how are you feeling at the

485
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
This point are you

486
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Happier

487
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Scared

488
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Feel ashamed of myself

489
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Because I thought

490
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
All the reason why I'm so excited about it is it

491
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Because it's in a country

492
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Where I don't live

493
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
And I'm an outsider and I think of it as being messed up

494
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
So it's okay for them

495
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
But it's still not okay for us

496
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
What did you think any

497
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
I mean

498
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Like this is where I

499
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Stop being a good journalist

500
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Because I picked

501
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Decide

502
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
It feels wrong

503
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Tinashe

504
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Solve these crimes

505
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
That we can solve

506
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,568
And what if his plane is on top of New York

507
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Good

508
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
God really

509
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
From me it became

510
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,040
Look at you remember like after 9/11 when you'd walk down the street and you cure the F6

511
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
16 circling over the city

512
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,464
I just remember the feeling in my stomach was like nausea like I felt sick

513
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
It felt

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Gross

515
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
It felt like we had no

516
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,680
Autonomy over ourselves in at that point I was scared enough that I could live with it but right now I don't feel that way

517
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
And

518
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
Look at it's a very privileged position

519
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
To be able to say that we shouldn't have

520
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
I get that

521
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
I've became a convert

522
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Because

523
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Somebody got kidnapped today

524
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
And if we had an eye in the sky we might be able to get the kids back in a few

525
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
Minutes hours

526
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,952
Compared to like you see the stats on Amber Alerts they're not good

527
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
What we're talking about is like and I'm not saying that I'm like anti McNutt at all but what I'm saying is like

528
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:06,240
It's very easy to paint it as we're going to get bad guys and I just don't think it's that Z

529
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
McNutt & Co

530
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,432
They seem like decent people they have set limitations for themselves they have said they will not use photography that could get any closer

531
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
Leave me the moral choice

532
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
How do we know other people will make the same world

533
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Joyce and

534
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Even though this thing might solve

535
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Ton of crime

536
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
I save lives

537
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
It's still not worth the risk

538
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Because

539
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
It just ask

540
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Level of

541
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Trust

542
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
In government

543
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
That we shouldn't

544
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
We shouldn't give

545
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
Is that what you're saying

546
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
For now yes

547
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
So

548
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
Back to dating what would happen in Dayton

549
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Well I was pretty impressed

550
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
After that five-day demo

551
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
The police chief

552
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Richard Beale

553
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
I recommended

554
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
That we

555
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Enter into

556
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
A contract

557
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Is veiled sister

558
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
So

559
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
They took it to the city Commission

560
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
It's minutiae New York

561
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
According to Carrie gray director of the city Commission office for the city of Dayton Ohio

562
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
The city commission was interested in the in the presentation but they decided that before they go forward they should have a public

563
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
So they can

564
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Hear from the

565
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,760
There was about 75 or so people there and he says that the people of Dayton

566
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
People of Radiolab

567
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Note to self

568
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,672
I'm very divided a quarter of the people

569
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Work

570
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
Supportive of this technology and they were frustrated with the amount of crime their belief was I'm not doing anything wrong

571
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
So I don't care what the people see me doing

572
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
We want this implemented and we want it implemented very broadly you know Bring It On they were basically

573
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
But

574
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Then there was another group

575
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
Slightly smaller but not my mind maybe 15% that was the Robert benucch Camp believe

576
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
That

577
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
This was

578
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Is a grotesque

579
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,416
Invasion of privacy and some of the people spoke in

580
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Very impassioned

581
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Terms

582
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
So

583
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Yay

584
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
I think they calling it grotesque invasion of privacy would pretty much reflect the weight and the way this group was feeling

585
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,008
And that there was no way that you could trust government

586
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,848
With is volume of information and this breath of information

587
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
So you had your Pros in your car

588
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
The rest of the people like the majority maybe had some feelings one way or another but just didn't have enough information and

589
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
And so they came and kind of

590
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Eye mask Quest

591
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
Like how long will persistent surveillance systems keep the images

592
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
90 days

593
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
How far can they zoom in can they see my face

594
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
Know something it'll ask questions

595
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,704
Which carry seems to think that they could have answered they could have gotten everybody on board

596
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
But in the end

597
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Even though the room was basically divided into

598
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Three parts

599
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
The naysayers we're so loud

600
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
And so impassioned

601
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,200
That these would have defined the combo

602
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
As we do

603
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
So we took that lesson to understand that

604
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
They was going to

605
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
To be

606
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Some significant

607
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,256
Education that was going to be needed and some significant hurdles that we're going to have to be crossed

608
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
Before that we were able to do a broad-based implementation

609
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
And

610
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,704
Based on the amount of time it was going to have to be spent

611
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,080
We decided there were other more immediate techniques that could be used it could be invested in

612
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
And we took the money that could have been spent on this

613
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
And spend it on some other activities

614
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
It seems like what you're saying is it like

615
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,576
It was just going to be too hard to get people of the heart also like a snot worth

616
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Yeah

617
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
I think that's probably probably accurate So the plan is off

618
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Table saw

619
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,768
It's off the table for right now

620
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
But that doesn't mean that it's never coming back on

621
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
I think it's fair to say

622
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Frustrating to him

623
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,872
Right now we've got about a hundred fifty million dollars for the proposal sitting out there

624
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,248
For a large number of cities Baltimore Philadelphia to Moscow with their were waiting for them to make

625
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
We've done Compton and Jerome

626
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,952
Compton's like maybe or is it like maybe dating is like maybe a whole lot of babies out there

627
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,816
What McKnight and his team were doing now and this is actually what they were doing when we went to visit them

628
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
They're analyzing as we are looking at a

629
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,568
Turnpike or something yet traffic in New Jersey

630
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Understanding traffic

631
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,456
We look at congested areas which are typically especially in that part of the country

632
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:36,832
Exits and on-ramps any kind of Junction in a highway sometimes you just

633
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Ice cream

634
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,864
Since we did that story things have happened manoush

635
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Did they have

636
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
That's why I've invited you back

637
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,032
Here to fill us in on further developments of which there have been gigantic one

638
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
Very recently yes and McNutt says not just

639
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Since we heard that episode but because we are that

640
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Episode

641
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
After this episode first one out

642
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,184
It turns out that there were a couple very wealthy philanthropist listening to Radiolab

643
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
And they pick up the phone

644
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
They called him and he said

645
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,840
We would like to be the people that bankroll

646
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,192
You giving us a try in a in an American city somewhere

647
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
So they he's biggest hits

648
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
Will write you a check if you can land the city will give you the money

649
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:35,712
Pretty much we decided who are these people they are Laura and John Arnold their young they're in their early forties they're

650
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Are in Texas

651
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
And by the time that they contacted McNutt

652
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
He already done as

653
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
As we said he'd already done a very expensive look at

654
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Cities Across the Nation

655
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
Looking for the one that had the biggest crime issue and is he puts it the strongest

656
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,632
Political leadership somebody who would be

657
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Willing to put up with The Firestorm that would inevitably ensue Baltimore fit the bill it had a

658
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
Mayor who said she was very tough on crime

659
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
Shootings were actually up in Baltimore by 72% last year

660
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
So he went

661
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Back to Baltimore instead

662
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,320
If I can get the money for this are you game

663
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
And they were like

664
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Sure

665
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,744
So the rich folks were willing to give money to the mayor of Baltimore

666
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,096
To put a plane in the sky to take pictures of Voldemort for a discrete. No not quite

667
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:28,704
So it didn't go to the government or any elected officials

668
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,032
Nobody needed to sign off on this in the city of Baltimore

669
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,360
Other than the police commissioner which is why he was able to do it

670
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,712
Without telling any of the city council members or

671
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
The mayor War II Baltimore Police Department without telling the mayor of the city council Rio

672
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
Besides the contract with this

673
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
Fellow supported by two people in Texas to put a plane in the sky to gaze down in Baltimore in every

674
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
Everyone in Baltimore I mean just don't mention this

675
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
To the mayor

676
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
Did McNutt move to Baltimore and do this

677
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,752
He moved to Baltimore

678
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,312
And they set up across the street

679
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:10,176
From the police station and had about a dozen analyst sitting there

680
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,272
For two months looking at everything that was going on in Baltimore

681
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
So

682
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,904
They did see some stuff during the street like a give me an a example of

683
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Something

684
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Bad that happened this day

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Everyone that we know about

686
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,632
Which is that there was an elderly brother and sister the woman is 90 years old

687
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
The brothers 82 and they work right there near this bus stop and they actually got in the line of fire they got gun

688
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Down by a shooter

689
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
And so they end up tracking a couple cars

690
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,224
But then later they think the police say actually we think he got away on foot

691
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
I think it was a witness

692
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,344
On the ground who said that they thought that he had left on foot

693
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
And so

694
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232
Rewind and they see a. Scrambling to get away from the scene

695
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
It goes

696
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,632
Down the street it passes a Subway sandwich shop it goes between these two houses

697
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm stopped at a car that's parked

698
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
And then it ends up at

699
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,336
They later discovered the home of a woman and turns out

700
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:14,432
Her boyfriend is somebody who has a long criminal record

701
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,808
And so there are over 700 CCTV cameras on the streets

702
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
In Baltimore and to the idea is that it's sort of a support mechanism right like they get the high-level then it goes to the store

703
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
Street then you got the officers on the ground and then shooter shoots man gets into a car and goes down Elm Street

704
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
You have cameras down on Elm Street

705
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:41,568
And you can see maybe the car and then the driver's license and maybe even capture the face

706
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
And did they eventually arrest

707
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
This person so he cries

708
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,480
State lines and the FEDS pick them up

709
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
Okay so they made the arrest

710
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
They going to court and they say to the judge okay we obtain information about the suspect in

711
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,768
Heart to Aspire plane does the stuff that they gathered during this

712
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Few months

713
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,912
Is that now going before judges in becoming evidence and arrests and prosecution

714
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
Well not yet we talk to the State's Attorney's office they got a briefing about a month ago from the police about what McNutt had

715
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Been up to

716
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,688
And they also told us that there are five open and pending cases

717
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
Where this surveillance technology

718
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
With you

719
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
The police are using it

720
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
And

721
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:29,440
They say this is the State's Attorney's office that they're looking forward to learning more about what

722
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
McNutt actually does

723
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,560
And they are trying to determine whether in fact

724
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
All those pictures

725
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
Could be used in some way at trial but they're not ready to say yes this absolutely will pass illegal

726
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
Muster in a trial

727
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,664
The other objection I guess I was thinking about was that the defense

728
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,504
The people as a matter of Justice as a matter of the Fourth Amendment

729
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
So you know this is going to come up with something

730
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Yeah then

731
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
The defense lawyers would say wait a second

732
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
This

733
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,536
Evidence against my client was obtained without not only his or her

734
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Permission but without anybody

735
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
Permission and the entire town

736
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Is now

737
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
In a

738
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
React searchable

739
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
During

740
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Just on sunny days

741
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:21,664
And did the founding fathers want that to happen he hasn't seen a ton of these

742
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
Master violence cases but actually Robert I mean

743
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
I happen to have the Fourth Amendment here and I want to read it to you

744
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
It's got you says you can't the searches and seizures are prohibited the right of the people to be secure in their persons house

745
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
Houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue

746
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
Issue but upon probable cause

747
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
Supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seen

748
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
So by that token inside

749
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
People to be searched

750
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
Everyone in Baltimore

751
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Places to be looked at

752
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Every place in Baltimore

753
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Oath to be

754
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Obtained

755
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,112
Ahead of time

756
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Blanket

757
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
That's a pretty radical thing

758
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,768
Yeah and when you put it like that no wonder there's

759
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
Very likely to be

760
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
Inevitable

761
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Big legal

762
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:18,496
Public debate over whether this is the answer to Baltimore's crime problem

763
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
McNutt says

764
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
He thinks very very soon

765
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
The police are going to release

766
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
An evaluation report

767
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
Looking at the effectiveness

768
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Of his Planes

769
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
He thinks

770
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
That

771
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,856
Whatever Baltimore decides

772
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
That's going to set a precedent

773
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,744
For mid-sized cities that are struggling across the United States

774
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728

George Shultz by the way the piece that we just listen to was produced by Andy Mills he is produced

778
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:13,280
Any number of Radiolab stories over the years and he has decided to move

779
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
To the New York Times

780
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
He's been a tremendous Boon to us

781
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Over and over again

782
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
He's brought

783
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
A worldview

784
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
And a sensibility that we can have

785
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Before he can not really

786
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
And I was going to work for that obscure newspaper

787

When Orwell wrote 1984

800
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
What policies did Satan have in place to prevent

801
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
Using the data

802
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,208
