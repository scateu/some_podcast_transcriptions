1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Before we start

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,400
This podcast contains some tape that

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Describe some pretty graphic violence

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
We

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
One let you know that

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Before we get going

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,336
Are you weightless

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,016
Northern listening to Radiolab

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,136
Radio WNYC

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,072
Hey I'm Jedi Cam'ron Garden Robert krulwich Radiolab in today

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
Going to start

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
This show with it with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times has had on the show before then say something

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Hi

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
Okay

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
From you like what are you guys doing how are you doing it

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,624
What are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yesterday what you're doing

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
So after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,888
American Teenager was shot and killed when that became a national story

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
There was a lot of bellyaching in the Press

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
Each year I know one keeps accurate statistics statistics on

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
Police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
And it struck me at the time that liked what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in awhile one of these things will catch fire

23
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
Fire

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Sam Dubose in the story and I personally was having

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Processing that like

26
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Number one

27
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Is there

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Is it trending

29
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
One way or the other

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Are police shooting more black people than white people

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Just very simple

32
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
The problem is

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
We don't know

34
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,736
We have no idea because nobody traxys FBI doesn't state agency

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,624
For the most part I said that. That doesn't exist somewhere within the police find itself in the police department does

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
On the local level

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
However

38
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
It doesn't exist in any Accurate Way

39
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
I'll buy a broader agency

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
I can tell you how many

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Purse snatchings there were in Florida 2011 using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for Department of Law Enforcement

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
I can't tell you how many times please

43
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Shots

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
Now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Incomplete

46
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Yeah cuz most of those

47
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Yell at the guardian has an online database

48
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,976
Most of them rely on media reports they're only really keeping track of the ones that serve hit the public consciousness

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
That's right

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
So Ben and his editors

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,608
. let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
First study guide

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Florida is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public record

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,712
Legally it's easier to get information Florida then and a lot of other places that sell

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Events at down insert emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida

56
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
88 emails

57
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
5 years

58
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured

59
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
Or killed as a result of that shooting.

60
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
This involves a year of work County Police Department's getting lawyers involved this is a massive thing that evolved

61
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Probably no less than a hundred people but

62
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
Eventually

63
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Been put together

64
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
The most comprehensive police shooting database

65
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
That we know of

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Richard Matt

67
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
Barbecue Center producer Matt kielty down to the Tampa Bay Times

68
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
I was just in right here

69
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
To check it out how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stairs and it's probably 5,000 pages

70
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Add a stack of paper that

71
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
About as tall as me

72
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,080
6 we talked we got a broken down by County but you can see

73
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
So a b Bay County

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Boca Raton

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Boynton Beach

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
Do the alphabet manila folders with tons of papers and then spread

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Craftsman Tire desk

78
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
The combination of

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
Use-of-force reports civil court records

80
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
And media clippings the represents

81
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
831

82
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Shootings

83
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
I hope every shooting in the State of Florida pain in 6 years time

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
2009 to 2014

85
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Toys R Us

86
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Go through all of this material

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Scrapy each of those reports for every

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Bit of information that we could

89
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Yet that we thought was useful

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Circumstantial stuff did involving SWAT team

91
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,183
Didn't involve an armed suspect was there Chase

92
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,303
All the demographic information for the firing officer or officers and the

93
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
People are hit by those bullets

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Then we thought

95
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Let's like learn from these let's see how

96
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
How we can compile the data and build a database and

97
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Hopefully Draw Something

98
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Conclusions lessons some

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Solutions

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
This is all going to go into it server giant online database

101
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Tampa Bay Times website

102
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Hopefully other

103
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff

104
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
In the meantime

105
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
Do some of the things have been founded initially some of it you know country priceless

106
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Well the biggest sword

107
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Counterintuitive

108
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
Line in this the numbers are flat

109
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
He says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year

110
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
After year the numbers of states that a

111
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
About a hundred thirty people shot by police

112
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
Every year which seems odd cuz you know the past couple years B's videos that go viral

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Makes it seem like this is a

114
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
I knew an intense

115
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Problem

116
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
The numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case

117
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
We also broke these down into categories

118
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,863
Because you know what you see like on the most basic level are there

119
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,471
About a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is

120
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
Quote mentally unstable this is a case we're not taking to guess

121
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
That whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which

122
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
There's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill maybe off their meds time of the shooting

123
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,879
Allegory Ben says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Hot

125
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Which is which somebody who's usually

126
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Mentally ill

127
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Apparently trying to

128
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
Get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police

129
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Standing on the porch standing behind the screen door

130
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
And raises a weapon tour

131
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
It's either weapon or or what they

132
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
I want the police to

133
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Think his weapon

134
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
So it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
To me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting

136
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
If you will cover police apparently know quite well you know there the news briefs

137
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
That you see

138
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Once or twice a week

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
But it was

140
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
News to us

141
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
I mean clearly

142
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,655
Police are now like the de-facto Frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
But when it got to bend Central Quest

144
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
What do the numbers say about race

145
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
I think I'm start with the fact

146
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Stat

147
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
I'm not sure it was so surprising

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
That

149
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
40% of people shot by police

150
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Are black

151
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
And that is that is out of whack with

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
The Florida

153
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Demographic

154
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Text me what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not 40%

155
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
It's more like 17

156
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,655
That's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely

157
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
We shot by police

158
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Then if you're white

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Sometimes much right now but the breakdown

160
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Between fatalities

161
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
For the same demographic

162
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
They're going through this particular set of numbers

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
50.9% were carrying a firearm 9% had a blade 70% involved

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Some form of resisting arrest numerous times over 2 years in a drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that

165
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
50.9

166
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
You know what's weird I start to feel like you I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but before the down

167
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
91 + 5706

168
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
The numbers themselves don't really get you very far

169
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
60%

170
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
It's just like yeah this is

171
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Only one

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
Ultimately limited way of knowing the proper

173
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah I mean

174
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
I mean what

175
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
This means like that I don't know it's

176
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
Back to where we were and why we want to start this

177
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
I'm still just moved by the single case the individual cases

178
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
And it's hard to remember that each of these is

179
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
And they're all written in this

180
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,751
Employment investigations revealed that a SPD officer Matthew Fowler received the colonist

181
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775

Oh yeah

265
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
I start seeing shirt after shirt off your shirt and I think of the time like 40 people had showed up in all these different chores I just

266
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Oh

267
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
This is

268
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Not just a thing for one person this is

269
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
A network

270
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Like almost everyone there had lost

271
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,279
Either a cousin or a brother or husband

272
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
I even even a daughter to

273
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Police violence

274
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
In fact when I say just go to one of those women you just heard have one with the graduation

275
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,079
Natasha Clements Route 23 old son Rodney Mitchell he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop

276
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
In that story later

277
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
But she told me that about 400 other mothers

278
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
They've reached out to me and I

279
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
400

280
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,135
Oh yes yeah through like traveling around through Facebook I've met 400 other mothers who's lost

281
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
The children

282
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Wow

283
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
Does it seem like a fraction of that at this community center

284
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Scales

285
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
Surprising thing for me was how you see these stories pop up 37 year old Alton Sterling

286
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
At least the ones that get pulled up to I like a national level and you see the family members come out

287
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
A man with children who dependent upon their daddy on a daily basis

288
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,599
For like two days you see them on television

289
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
That big fat do

290
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Was a father

291
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Then they kind of recede

292
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
And they're gone

293
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,167
I guess what I thought is you know probably they have these long drawn-out legal battles and then

294
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
They go back to their lives

295
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Whatever

296
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Whatever that means

297
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Oh no

298
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
What happens if you get

299
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
Like folded up into this

300
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Network

301
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Can we pray for those mostly

302
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
You coming to this

303
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
And so at the Q Center there was a moment of prayer where the 40 to 50 people sat down at these big round dining table

304
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Once upon a time ago

305
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
It was no Coalition like so we have today

306
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631

307
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007

308
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
And how to protect our kids now lover

309
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
We excuse prayers and all prayers

310
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
God's name

311
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Amen

312
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Until after the prayer

313
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,367
Crystal Palace in the back of the room forever to eat so everyone stood up and in the Bible

314
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183

4 days later in that jail cell she was found dead

341
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Hang up lights

The garbage bag

343
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
The death was ruled a suicide

344
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Instant family

Geneva reed-veal Sandra Bland

348
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,567
Events like this before

349
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
Jobs in Missouri last week we go all around we try to support as many mothers as we can because it's

350
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
Is that exactly what it is is it really just like it's important because

351
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Who is lost their baby

352

See somebody else who looks like them

Who's in the same situation if they are

355
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,375
As opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I know how you feel but you really don't

356
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,519
Anything but something then and I had talked about a lot which is

357
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
And getting to meet these women and talk to these women

358
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
You sensed it through their experiences is really

359
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Unique

360
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Sort of loss

361
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
It sucks to lose somebody to cancer

362
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
I've lost

363
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Friendly cancer recently

364
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Is a horrible

365
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,719
Every ten ten times a hundred times worse for his

366
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Prince wife

367
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Children

368
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
It is for me

369
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
I need the different

370
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
When

371
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,167
Your person is killed by another human being and that human being

372
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Is returns

373
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
To the streets

374
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
With a gun and a badge in a you know

375
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
In a position of authority

376
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
And something you do see in bed numbers even though the numbers themselves

377
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
I can't really tell you whether or not

378
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
A shooting with

379
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Legally just

380
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
What is queer

381
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,927
Is that over 800 + shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed

382
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
Only one police officer

383
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Has ever been charged

384
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
It is weird sort of like

385
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Double grief

386
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
Yeah it's like past and present

387
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Same time

388
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Mercante

389
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
Put it away because it's everyday is another insult kind of

390
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Right

391
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
Batman against Chris Brown somebody one of us

392
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:38,111
You know here in Florida we're going we're going to reach out to each other and then we're going to invite a man weave

393
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,511
The club that nobody really wants to be crazy but this is family

394
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
This is my family and I could not have made it this far. I couldn't still be

395
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
I wouldn't be doing anything if it wasn't for them

396
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,175
So after the event ended up Community Center Crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got their cars and drove over

397
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
2

398
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Dislike little gem shop

399
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,623
Just like you guys do this after every every event or is this just like crystal meth just once around

400
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,183
And has been telling everyone about this

401
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
Is Deanna Joseph her son Andrew died in 2014

402
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
Be part of the different type of learning this is a part of just poking and dreaming we all just simply trying to fight

403
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Find a way

404
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
If a crystal gathered like probably 15 of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I

405
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
I cope or here's how I deal with

406
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
My grief you can even get there

407
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
The largest age women in a big bundle of sage in her hand

408
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
I want to do like your house I can look like

409
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
Then I open my windows and I just be real I go through my house

410
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Concert

411
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
And then they went from The Gem Shop

412
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
Holy Crystal

413
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
Oh no

414
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:10,271
Mid-sized one-story house into land and lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking

415
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Band about his story

416
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:17,696
Crystal and her cousin in the kitchen cooking chicken

417
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,352
Me by surprise is how these women when they come together

418
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,216
They like they bring with them and their own stories he's stories of grief of of suffering

419
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
And yet when they're in the same room together

420
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
It's like they just they just have fun

421
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,576
Play the night before they all gone out dancing together

422
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
Fire

423
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,400
And now we're doing instead of getting motel room

424
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Again this is Natasha Clements

425
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
Restarting to stay over it until the cows

426
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,384
With eating each other's dead air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleepover

427
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Inverse of a quantity for uptalking eunos getting to know each other you know some stories about each other's children so it's like

428
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Bike therapy for

429
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,440
Becky let me pass but it was this moment when I spent the day with these women.

430
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Really

431
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
Stop at me believer ad

432
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584

There's been Crystal let some of us over to the site

434
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Where

435
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,520
At her ex-husband Marlon was hit by that squad car

436
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
At 12

437
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,688
People are in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or child

438
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
Movie theaters in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass

439
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
Mom's house probably over like right now

440
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
And then the police car that came behind him was probably right here

441
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
And then the officer that hit that hit them

442
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Came in

443
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
We came in he came right here

444
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
That's why we spent all day

445
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Vegetable garden

446
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
The garden was

447
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
And vegetables

448
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856

449
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
All that lay I ain't saying

450
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Cuz

Took him away and released in 2008. We came back he has all you can smell

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,008
It's not as bad now but just the association smell

00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776

00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824

Mine is broken

466
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
Probably about these eight women who

467
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
Hobbled together and they just

468
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Stared at the camera

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
With this sort of straight face

470
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448

A few of these women started to call themselves

The mothers of the movement

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

530
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
And I'm here because I need your help

531
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
And I request

532
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

533
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Aunts and uncles

534
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,856
Teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliant

535
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,208
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

536
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,536
That just means you lean back and say whoa

537
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Maybe it was the moment that

538
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
A kid you've been reading to 4 months

539
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Started reading back to you

540
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Or maybe the kid was a piano

541
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,104
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

542
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,712
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

543
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
We're interested in the

544
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Epic moments where

545
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,904

Police violence

560
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
And I'm sitting across the table from the African American city councilman Daytona Beach and I told him what I've been working on I told him some of the numbers with

561
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,784

500000 bikers from all over the country in Daytona International Speedway

566
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
And on top of that

567
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Department of population Arizona

568
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
C2000 people

569
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
Remember that six-year. They only had 4 police shooting

570
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
And that's low-key like that that's

571
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Really low

572
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Jessie

573
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
I need the breakdown for 2015

574
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
In fact while we were there by race

575
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Tickets

576
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Pinterest

577
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
Joanna's assistant print out these spreadsheets

578
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Every other day

Stats

580
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Thank you

581
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,240
Any kind of fascinating cuz if you look at them can go right down here and you can add them up

582
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Things like

583
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
Aggravated aggravated assault theft

584
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
Shoplifting a speeding or arrest ratio

585
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
And our ticket ratio

586
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Basically mirrors are City

587
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
In terms of racial Democrat

588
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,832
It was roughly a 60/40 shity 60%

589
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
White 40% African American

590
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
It's pretty much what you see

591
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Tickets for speeding about

592
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,560
60/40 respite apus 60/40 that's the way we're supposed to

593
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
In theory

594
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Approach the law

595
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
And so what are they doing differently

596
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
First of all when all these the incidents were occurring in

597
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
Around the country with Fergus and everything else we did it racing policing mandatory training for the entire PD and basically

598
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
What we wanted

599
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,016
Our officers to do with number one learn the history of the country

600
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Good history of the country is that we are a racist Nation no matter how you look at it

601
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Started with moving the Indians

602
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Off of their land

603
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
For manifest destiny

604
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,560
When you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the Civil War youku

605
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,632
Slavery when you look in the fitt bull connor for example

606
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
I'm turning the dog in fire hose is loose

607
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
On civil rights Marchers

608
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,592
George important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community

609
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,480
And you may think and I can't walk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not

610
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,064
But let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased

611
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
In in policing Vice we all have bias in it

612
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,512
And a trick is at and I don't know what the trick I don't know of any of us know how to contain that

613
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
How do we stop at bias

614
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
I'm coming through when you make a decision

615
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
And I think a lot about him

616
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
Seems like

617
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
I feel like a Kinder way to say

618
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Pier

619
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Kaffir

620
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
A black person

621
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
And that fear is greater than

622
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,200
What you feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job

623
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
What is a cop

624
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
When you look at some of the shootings record on video and I and I think of the poor

625
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
School Janitor who lost his life

626
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
In Minnesota

627
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
The Atlantic

628
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
There's a guy who

629
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,792
Told the officer in no uncertain terms I'm a good guy

630
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
I have a gun permit

631
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
You can't get a gun permit

632
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,960
If you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if your drug dealer

633
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
It was a minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit

634
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
For some unknown reason

635
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
That officers

636
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
Threat Level with a baby in the car

637
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,248
And I got a guy and his kidneys girlfriend is a gun permit holder

638
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
This is Chris's Music Arts.

639
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,952
For some reason in an in reason is because of the color of the main skin all of those things never registered Black Irish

640
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Pocket

641
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
And I shoot

642
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
And then I would like to tell you in all my years in policing I would like to sit here and be not even tell you

643
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Bat

644
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
We don't shoot unarmed people

645
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
L28 year practitioner law enforcement second generation cop

646
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,056
I'm appalled at what I see when those videos I cannot believe

647
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
At my profession

648
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
In some cases is that out of control

649
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
Some of them I understand what's going on I mean wrestling in the ground for your life and you and you and you know they weren't there are times we have to use deadly force but the answer

650
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
South Carolina

651
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,160
Dancing in Minnesota I mean are you kidding me you looking or what are we doing

652
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
How do you how do you train that out of an officer

653
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,048
So that we make a traffic stop they're not already operating with a

654
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
This level of height

655
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Iran

656
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,192
Is perceived threat in my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound

657
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
You have to train using a real life scenarios

658
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
That take that extra split-second

659
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Before you fire your weapon

660
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:01,760
And I'll give you that it go to rubbery quickly when I first went to Philadelphia Police Department we were shooting people

661
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Had a crazy rate

662
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
On an accidental discharge

663
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:11,488
The officer had your finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved you would get your back in

664
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
It was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger

665
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
Go back up to the police academy and we all had to be retrained on how to keep your finger on the side plate of the weapon

666
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
Not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody

667
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,896
And you went to photo is Armageddon oh my God going to get us killed one reality

668
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,992
What it did was it slow down your field division

669
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,624
It's load everything on that split-second it make a difference that blink-of-an-eye didn't make a difference it made a difference in you not shooting

670
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
People that Split Second let you see what you thought may have been

671
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
Did the color of my glass coming at my cell phone was it cell phone

672
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,936
So you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that you would come back to again and again is this idea of time

673
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
In certain situations

674
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Slow down

675
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
When you're dealing with a mentally ill person

676
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,944
Slow down cover just crates in space to buy yourself another 30 seconds that extra 30

677
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,016
3 seconds maybe the difference between saving your life and somebody else's life

678
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Another interesting thing was

679
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
Ben 10 Tennyson also threw some herbs reporting with other police chief

680
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:16,512
Is the idea that somebody's cheese don't like to hire kids at a high school like 19 20 year olds

681
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
In part because this

682
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
Text a lot to communicate is like this

683
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,216
Anyway when they look up and go to talk to somebody I'm and I'm serious about going through the drive-through McDonald's

684
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,520
And I could piss off the person ordering cheeseburger

685
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Halle how did you do it

686
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,616
Just her demeanor just the way they act

687
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:36,224
And back then told me that he thought it in police chief who told him the young people were coming into the

688
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Academy

689
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Past years

690
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
I've never been in a physical fight

691
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
The problem because when they get into a fight their heart starts to race in the muscles tense up and I don't really know what to do so they

692
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,816
Freak out and they're way more likely to draw weapon and use the weapons

693
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
Tutu in the confrontation

694
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
So how do you do that you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beating up on your messenger

695
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
Says that that's why I at least you told me he looks

696
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,272
He said from just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful High number

697
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,808
Of many women have served in the military

698
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,464
They are my best officers they are level-headed they're well trained to know how to follow the policy basically know how to not

699
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Freak out

700
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Dirty competition

701
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
And

702
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Lasting

703
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Lasting

704
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,496
20 most important things to it says you have to get into the community and I'm not talkin about that the good stuff over there before Christmas gifts are they

705
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,824
Play cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm talkin day-to-day you have to get to know key

706
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Yeah I mean

707
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,760
Until it to make this point Chitwood got up walk me down the hall to another office

708
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
Computer

709
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Okay

710
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Show me this video

711
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Tobias card

712

In silence and its body cam video its body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he goes body cam

713
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400

The call is Borg I was running around in like trying to stab people he's off his meds that he was going to

717
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,016
Crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly

718
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:19,648
Blue neighborhood street and you can see down the street and walk away

719
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
Shirtless black guy

720
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,536
That's the cop talking to him copper in the body Cam and

721
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
This black man got his arm raised walking towards the cops

722
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
But it gets closer

723
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Closer

724
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,616
Closer body cam pulls out the taser

725
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,224
The other officer behind him with his firearm out

726
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,624
And the guy is approaching approaching approaching approaching

727
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
And then

728
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
The goat body cam Fires at Kaiser the guy holding the 90 Falls onto his back on a dislike cement driveway still

729
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Play It Again

730
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Hey girl are you going to get him again. He hustled over a kicks knife out of

731
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,968
Is hand grab them by the hand turns them over

732
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,528
And then he's a chain Central code for

733
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,928
Cups and it's not as it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out the police officer

734
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Cheryl say why didn't you listen to me and just dropped the knife and walked her me why did you keep coming at me

735
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,936
Moonshiner best to get shot

736
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
You want to die

737
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
You want to die

738
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
You can't die he tells you overdose on Jesus Christ

739
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,688
And I want everybody know the police bullets can't kill me

740
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
All right there

741
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
We going to stand upright

742
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,576
Counseling 1 2 3

743
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,160
Need to come pick him up walking over to the squad car

744
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Put them in

745
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,120
So this is the thing that you guys would you use this video for what exact one of

746
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,704
Let multitude of videos that we show officers on the correct way to do things

747
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,824
You know when and that's the point we get home or the officers used time and distance

748
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
To their advantage

749
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Didn't pull right up

750
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,736
And right away

751
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
They use verbal command first

752
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Warren and let him know what's going on

753
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Trigger control with another thing

754
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
You know what that Taser Taser Taser

755
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,144
Heard a pop and fired his gun

756
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,544
So you know he's appointment Kaiser and communication is this key communication with the person you're trying to arresting communication with you

757
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Your fellow officers

758
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
Those are the things that we drive home

759
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
And again there was no doubt in my mind

760
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,016
That they won officer in particular knew that individual from prior contact

761
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,320
Read minutes interesting to hear me say

762
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
The name Derek

763
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Lake Derrick

764
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Is Derek and Erika Sanchez

765
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
The black man

766
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Shirtless with a knife in his hand

767
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
When there's no connection error

768
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,608
It's a lot easier to see somebody is nameless and faceless and I got scared and I shot him

769
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,424
But because of that knowing that officer

770
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,984
Because of that and establish some kind of rapport

771
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
That made the officer

772
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Think

773
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:28,320
Lexi after we finish watching a video and I was packing up chat with told me that just a couple months after that incident

774
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
The neighborhood

775
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Information on the front step waves

776
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Did Derek does

777
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,000
You stupid sonofabitch you on how close you came to being dead

778
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
Recycling medication

779
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
Wasn't

780
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Doing drugs

781
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
Is normals mean you are right now

782
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,776
Again almost kind of like

783
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
When I was with these women it felt like I was just

784
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,872
In Daytona at this

785
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
Specific moment because

786
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,247
Just a few months after I left last night

787
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,319
Primary election among the big Winners Daytona Beach

788
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Police chief

789
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
He is now

790
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,951
Volusia County's new sheriff Mike Chitwood was elected

791
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,815
The sheriff of Volusia County

792
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:18,239
Which is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to

793
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Has organization called Perth which is the Police Executive Research Forum it's as big coalition

794
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,455
Beasties 2016 / put out

795
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,783
What they called her 30 guiding principles for the use of force

796
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,135
And the number one principle rather than being something Law and Order Law and Order is

797
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
The sanctity of human life

798
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,791
I'm just a month after proof put out those principles to the biggest

799
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,655
Gleason organizations in the world the ICP the International Association of chiefs of police

800
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Fraternal Order of Police

801
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,775
Epic leasing in both came out against

802
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
These guiding

803
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:58,175
Baby saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it

804
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
More dangerous

805
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:05,087
And then just like eight months later so the ICP and the Fraternal Order of Police

806
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Started to adopt

807
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Some of these

808
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Principles publicly

809
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,839
Despite that there still is a bit of a divide between but according to Ben for the very first time I think you're seeing these masks

810
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Conversation

811
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
The police weren't talking about this two or three years ago

812
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,775
I don't know man just thinking about this like you've got these women

813
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
Cool how I become kind of a political

814
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Force

815
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,711
You have also this growing movement of cops who are

816
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,319
Possibly changing way policing is done in America at least maybe slowly

817
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
But cumulatively does

818
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
I hesitate to use this word but it does make

819
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Just feel like

820
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
Reason for Hope

821
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
Ray and I thought the same

822
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
Wait to bite

823
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,471
It wasn't anything I had registered realized

824
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
How far

825
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
Hope Has

826
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,359
You go we are here to see Natasha Clements

827
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
Natasha Clements the mother of Rodney

828
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:09,343
Woman who you heard earlier but I'm back at the community center

829
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
That's actually when I first met her

830
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
And have been reporting on Natasha for like a couple years by this point

831
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,631
Are they because Ben was going to hand a ton of documents over to Natasha on her son Ronnie's case

832
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Have any

833
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,519
And I'm sad because we set up a short interview with Natasha but when we got to the door

834
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
She just started

835
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,783
Sobbing

836
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
And

837
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Can I just had no

838
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
Idea what happened

839
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Appendicitis

840
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Tape recorder off

841
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
So what was

842
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
What was happening in that moment

843
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
The backup

844
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
So meeting somebody like

845
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
Chip wood

846
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
You know

847
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
I sort of hoping that I've believed

848
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,103
The thing about a Chitwood

849
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
Sheriff police chief is it

850
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
The only have

851
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
The power to fire

852
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Police officer

853
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
And that's

854
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
Good about it after that

855
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,599
It goes into the court system

856
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
And so

857
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
Natasha

858
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,255
Her son Ronnie 23 years old unarmed was shot and killed by

859
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,303
Two police officers during a traffic stop

860
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,399
After the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong they attacked

861
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Accordance with the law

862
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
And

863
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,031
It just so happened at 45 minutes before

864
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
Bentonite

865
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
Showed up at her door

866
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
She just got an email from a lawyer saying that the appeal that she

867
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Filed

868
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
Against that decision

869
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
I had just been rejected

870
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
We sat there and Natasha's apartment for a while we actually

871
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Even left for like an hour

872
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Eventually came back

873
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Kind of just hit

874
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Reset on the whole thing

875
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,143
Natasha show me some pictures of Rodney long dreads

876
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
Big smile bright white smile

877
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Let me sit down at a kitchen table

878
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Okay so

879
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
If you can walk me back

880
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151

881
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
The night that kind of everything everything

883
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
11 2012

884
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
Natasha was at home 9:30 at night Rodney who is 23 years old with back from college and out driving a Tesla car

885
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
That's another phone call start happening

886
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
People calling saying something's going on with your car

887
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
I knew something was wrong so I immediately started screaming outside to see if I can get somebody to you no response

888
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,751
Help me so I can get a ride

889
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,823
Nobody Camp came out so I started running down the interstate

890

Left I'm leaving free call locking the door or anything like that

892
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,063
Let's see if family member actually picked her up they drive to the scene she gets there

893
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
Everywhere police

Where is Rodney I was looking for my vehicle

896
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
Smione card

897
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
He's over there

898
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
20 by 20 feet over to where the car to come to a stop it

899
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Clyde with gas

900
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Potatoes sheet

901
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
The back of my

902
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Poop my pants

903
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Xidan run over there

904
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:42,591
The whole place was surrounded by police tape and eventually Natasha says it took a couple hours but a cop pulled her off to

905
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Genocide

906
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
And told her that her son

907
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,943
I've been shot and killed by police

908
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,759
I just got on my hands and knees and started praying

909
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,551
Don't make the speech Rose please lower

910
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
Basically begging you playing

911
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
I think I could.

912
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
What

913
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
What else do you do

914
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Cry ring

915
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,327
Pray cry stream Praise Christian pray next thing you know I woke up I was

916
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
At the hospital

917
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
Natasha says that she apparently was so frenzied the nemt on the scene stuck with something that's on me.

918
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
So when I woke up

919
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
I see my family standing over me

920
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Not fair

921
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,735
Now as to what happened to Rodney that night then his look

922
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
A testimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses

923
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
Different court records

924
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,231
The piece together the events documents that night Rodney and his car

925
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,375
Did Saturday gas station they left the gas station and we're driving down this highway windy in his little cousin

926
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,447
I get pulled over by two white officers

927
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
Doctor said he saw him without a seatbelt

928
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:50,175
Turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches vehicle one is kind of standing in front of the car about several feet away

929
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,503
Towards like the driver side and also approaches his window

930
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,551
Corning Ronnie's cousin boy

931
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
Why didn't you pull over sooner

932
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,927
And and then orders Rodney to put the car in park

933
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,743
Ronnie's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel

934
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
And he reaches down to put the car in park

935
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Invisible things in the story started to purge

936
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
Because the cops say the Rodney

937
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
Put the car in park but then quickly put it back into drive

938
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
Accelerated at the officer in front of the car

939
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
Annie's cousin gives two conflicting accounts as to

940
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
What happened there was apparently

941
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
My witnesses

942
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
Stream said the car had yet to move

943
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
But what is clear

944
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,271
Is what happened next which is Deputy

945
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,343
In front of gun fires Two Shots into the windshield

946
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
The deputy right by the door here's the fire

947
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
He pulls a gun in fire

948
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
One bullet went through Ronnie Platt and would you put up in self-defense another bullet entered through his left temple and

949
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
The car lurches forward and Corinne's across the street for about 300 yards until it collides with this gas station Ronnie's cousin at this point

950
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
Get out of the car

951
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
Sweetness in unharmed

952
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
Mention paramedics arrived in pronounce Ronnie debit the same

953
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,967
My mind is always on Rodney

954
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Natasha says when she does think about that night

955
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,319
Joy comes back to this one

956
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Question

957
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
Why were the guns.

958
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Why

959
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Why what

960
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,231
Why was it what was that all about

961
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
What do you think the answer

962
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
He black

963
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
And that's just it

964
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,959
Deborah moment where you try and put yourself in the mind of those two officers

965
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
Absolutely not because I would never do

966
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
Buy skate like that

967
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
But never

968
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Cross now

969
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,151
I would never do that

970
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
You feel like it's like

971
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
Do you feel like the cop in that moment

972
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
Ronnie's black is what

973
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
Frightens the cop

974
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
That's why he pulls his gun out

975
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
Pizza Boli's

976
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,743
Hell if he if somebody gets hurt or somebody gets injured or killed

977
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
He's going to get off

978
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
He's behind the blue bad she's a bully

979
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,679
Is that what you think of cops like writ large

980
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
If I what is

981
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,543
That's exactly how it is Nokia Femmes and buts about it

982
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,359
Is it hard for me cuz I think like

983
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,967
Like it's clear that there's discrimination with that exist within the police force

984
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
And the people who they are

985
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Sworn to protect and serve

986
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,343
But like at the end of the day

987
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
There's probably

988
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,463
Ain't like no I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage of the number of officers

989
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Which lake

990
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Yes they're probably

991
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
Violent individuals

992
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
Don't belong in a place for us

993
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
But I would

994
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
Assume that like a majority of the cops

995
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Meanwell

996
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
Have probably probably have

997
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Some sort of bias

998
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Where

999
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,127
They don't think I see

1000
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
A black person

1001
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
And I'm going to Lake

1002
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
I'm going to get that boy

1003
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,063
But that there's like it like there's some sort of triggered response

1004
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
And that the police

1005
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
Are currently being put into different situations where they

1006
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
I feel under threat

1007
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
And concerned

1008
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
And that like

1009
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
It looks like a

1010
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
Whole host of factors leading to this moment for somebody

1011
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Is shot and killed

1012
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,471
It's not just that they're out here

1013
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Bullying people

1014
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
You say that because you were

1015
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
You're white

1016
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
That's why you say that

1017
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
Tell you what

1018
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
I tell you what we can try this

1019
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,831
Go to my sister will make sure you get your wig

1020
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,647
Go to tanning salon get yourself sprayed black

1021
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,695
My guarantee you'll get a different response

1022
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
I dare you try I bet you we can make you look like a black boy

1023
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,071
I'm telling you

1024
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
You'll see a huge difference

1025
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
And that's just it

1026
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
Like sitting like sitting there

1027
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
In that moment

1028
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
I felt

1029
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
I felt the Gulf

1030
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,687
And

1031
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Wandering Lake

1032
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,623
How long does it take to fill that golf

1033
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Like how many

1034
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
Chitwood's does it take

1035
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
How many conversations need to happen

1036
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
In case you want to stay

1037
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
Ben Stiller to give Natasha those files on Rodney

1038
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,079

00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Appreciate it

Folder of paper out of the trunk of a car
