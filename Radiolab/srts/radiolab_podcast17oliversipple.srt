1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,864
Quick note this story contains some profanity

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
Junior couple

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,704
No just know that before we get going

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Are you awake

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,664
Listening to Radiolab

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,784
Radio WNYC

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,560
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert Radiolab and today we are going to start with a producer

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
Let's just go back to San Francisco on a particular day at a particular time

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,544
Killer Women hello is this Sarah Jane

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
Yes it is woman named Sara Jane Moore Sarah Jane

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,552
What day was September 22nd the particular time 1975

12
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
It's a Monday morning was a nice day I don't remember anything different so I assumed it was a nice day

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
You know in my own head

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Surgeon

15
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Not on this Monday morning

16
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,704
She wakes up early drops or nine-year-old off at school runs a few errands

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
Then she drives downtown to this

18
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,896
This big fancy hotel what was the name of the hotel

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:26,272
I'm 87 years old don't expect

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
But at any rate you know I parked in a parking garage across

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
Right across from the hotel is a park but there's a

22
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Parking garage underneath

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,608
Walk every walk across the street that there were sidewalks on both sides of the street

24
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,656
There were people on both sidewalks

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
She joins the crowd across the street from the hotel was very crowded couple thousand people it's like a big scene and there was

26
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
Barrier a rope barrier right

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
Keeping us back on the sidewalk

28
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,736
And my plan has always been to be back in the crown

29
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
You know what I was dressed like every other middle-aged woman that was there so I don't remember what you were wearing

30
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Temperature there

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,792
Older pictures of it yes I was wearing I was wearing slacks that was

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
That was at the beginning of winter

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Natural for women to wear slacks

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
I had a coat on

35
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,984
And I was carrying a purse and I went back into the middle of the crowd

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
I had planned to do anyway

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
I thought a man come up against man

38
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,944
Socializes I wasn't that day and time I spun around to Slappy's face

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,832
She see this guy there big strong guy blond hair look at him and realize that it was

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,648
He had not done anything out of the ordinary that

41
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
I turn back around

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
And I went on about my business

43
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
I was in pushed up

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,376
Crowd pressure was such I tried to stay back in the ground

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,216
But I got pushed up almost on to the ropes in the front

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Write up on the curb of the sidewalk

47
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Why do I not plan to be

48
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
And he apparently was still right behind me

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
So maybe he was pushed out by the crowd also

50
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
And so Sarah Jane is just crammed into the

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,160
Crowd and she's just standing there

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
Going about doing what I set out to do

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
So

54
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
She waits

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
And she waits

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
And an hour goes by and two and three and then finally

57
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
Out of the hotel comes none other than the president of the United

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
United States Gerald Ford that he has

59
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Police and Secret Service they're all coming to walking out of the hotel to get in his car which was parked there on the street

60
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,696
But he sees the crowd Sarah Jane actually says he looks directly at her

61
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
And

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Waves

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
He waves to the crowd and everyone starts

64
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
Applauding and cheering

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Now

66
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Right at that moment

67
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Sarah Jane

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Regis her right hand

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Into her purse and

70
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Pulled a gun out of my purse

71
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
A 38 caliber revolver

72
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
Cox it and then she takes aim right at Gerald Ford's head

73
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
And then

74
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
Mr. Ford did not fall

75
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
For chips the wall behind him Ford

76
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Freezes in place Sara Jean never plan to take a second shot

77
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
And still in the air holding the gun looking over the smoking barrel of the gun and she's got enough time if you wanted

78
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
But before she can take that second shot the blond man behind her lunges

79
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Grabs her gun arm pulls it down and deflect it for just that crucial second

80
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
50 police officers nearby need to get to her the tackle her they take our guns and the pentagram

81
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
So I couldn't move and buy that points the secret service has whisked off the president into the limousine and I was in

82
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Immediately picked up and carried across the street

83
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Into the hotel

84
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Arrested

85
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
And eventually

86
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,719
Cheap went to prison and she served 32 years in prison and then

87
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
And then after that was released on parole

88
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
And then we talked to her

89
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Weihai

90
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
God prepared

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
To be told the first-person narrative from the perspective of someone who's about to be president that was not what I was expecting

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,687
I was hoping that weight can you explain know why it is she decided to shoot the night

93
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Never fully explained that and when I asked her what this is not

94
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
She was like I'm not going there this is not an interview about

95
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,023
What was driving me or about what I did or why did it this is an interview about mr. simple

96
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
Sipple Oliver Sipple the random blonde guy who just happened to be

97
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Standing next to Sara Jane Moore that date the guy who grabbed her arm and save the president's life and T-Pain

98
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
Dearly for that I actually called up Sarah Jane and had her tell that whole story because I was actually interested in what

99
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
What happened to Oliver Sipple after that because had he not

100
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,183
Reached out and put his hand on my arm

101
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
None of this would have happened to him

102
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Wait what happened to him

103
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,471
So Oliver Sipple actually died in 1989 but

104
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
Before we go to destroy I just want to give you a picture of the guy

105
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
So

106
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,431
Just Google search Oliver Sipple Ford or something

107
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Wait okay wait I see the picture

108
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
Muscular guy kind of blond hair he's at he's at

109
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
He's a

110
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
He's a handsome guy yeah he's a he's a little bit James Dean

111
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
And Marlon Brando had a baby, or something all American

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
We're bringing in another All-American for the story Daniel Lutzer editor at

113
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Oxford University press

114
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
And a few years ago

115
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
Probably more than 5 years ago I wrote

116
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
An article

117
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
About Oliver Sipple

118
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,319
Anyway to get back on track September 22nd 1975

119
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,415
Sara Jane Moore fire snapshot Oliver Sipple grabbed her arm the police

120
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
Russell Moore to the ground in a police actually grab Oliver to pull them inside the hotel the question is

121
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
Initially some confusion about what he was doing there and some thought that you know he might have been a suspect

122
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
So he's in this hotel trying to light a cigarette but

123
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
He just couldn't do it because he was shaking so hard

124
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
Oliver had served very rough tours in Vietnam

125
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
Loud noises Woods would make him very unhappy I think this is the sort of thing we might call poster

126
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
Traumatic stress disorder now

127
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
But when eventually Oliver started to calm down the Secret Service were like

128
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
What are you even doing here it's kind of hard to answer because it's like didn't even really knows like

129
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
And I just bumped into this

130
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
Huge crowd of people asked what was going on people like oh like Gerald Ford is going to be here any other the president is going to

131
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
So he said he thought I might as well see him

132
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
And then he was standing there for a couple hours until he saw a flash of metal realized it was a gun reacted quickly

133
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Instinctively and then

134
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
You guys all put me in here

135
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Can you be here

136
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
So cute question for 3 hours he goes home

137
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Don't is 4th floor walk-up

138
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
And there's a reporter that waiting for him

139
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
My butt

140
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
He just wants to

141
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
Serta be left alone and he told this reporter quote

142
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,711
I'm a coward I don't know why I did it it was the thing to do at the time

143
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,319
And isn't even after that he just keeps getting phone calls from reporters and then some of them

144
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
Learned that he was a marine until they would ask him questions like oh was it your

145
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,023
You know what that your training is that why you did this heroic thing but he said like

146
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,887
Oh you know listen don't mention of any of that stuff about the Marines you know I got to keep that Under Wraps

147
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm no hero or nothing

148
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
But

149
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,383
The next day after day

150
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Contra game deflected by an ex-marine

151
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
Vietnam veteran named Oliver Sipple television

152
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,439
Ex-marine to flex weapon is woman shoots

153
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
That's the LA Times Chicago Tribune

154
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Sero tells how we deflected woman's arm and

155
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
Despite his best efforts Oliver becomes a national hero for a day

156
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Appears that he sort of thought that would be yes

157
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
Maybe his friends would give him a pat on the back like I'm a couple rounds and then you know over the next couple days at all

158
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Ulcerative like Ripple out of control

159
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Because that very same day that Oliver was being painted as a hero this guy named herb Kane the long

160
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
Long time San Francisco

161
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
Columnist walked into his office and on his answering machine

162
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Work to message

163
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071

So let's

174
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Just

175
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Take a Magic Carpet Ride

176
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Close your eyes

177
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
And

178
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Let the sound take you away

179
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Tolerated that's why San Francisco sometimes labeled with a slide caption Queen City of the West

180
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
San Francisco was one of the first cities in America have a gay pride

181
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
My Parade in the 70s boys go to bed with boys and girls are better than girls and

182
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,671
Forget people San Francisco was like this Shelter From The Storm many of us were immigrants from somewhere

183
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
10 male long time San Francisco resident

184
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Kansas

185
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Escaped from Kansas

186
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Because

187
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
What the West

188
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,311
Offered was the Ethereal promise if you will of reinvention

189
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
You could cross the line in which your past

190
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Stay behind you

191
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,063
It was a place where you could be out but to the people you left behind you can still be in

192
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
So a super Oliver you know he came from Michigan from a working-class family I had a lot of brothers and sister

193
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
Can use one of the eight children

194
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,263
And he was perfectly open about his sexual orientation and would tell anybody who asked that he was a gay man

195
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
But you know you never told his family

196
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
Until Oliver lived like a lot of gay people is a time this

197
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Double life and do we know that this is the reason why I said mechanic San Francisco or was there a difference

198
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Harvey Milk is there

199
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
The Harvey Milk you know famous gay activist

200
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
San Francisco politician he was friends with Harvey Milk

201
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
A New York

202
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
An immigrant from New York turns out Oliver had actually met Harvey a decade earlier New York

203
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
I just want to mention this because it's so cool the time they actually dated the same guy who was the

204
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,383
The inspiration for Sugar Plum Fairy sugar

205
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,735
In Lou Reed Walk on the Wild Side

206
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
Just a fun fact just a fun fact

207
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
That's it but

208
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
Oliver Harvey they were pretty good friends

209
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
They correspond it's in touch when they lived in different places in the country IP Harvey even loans Oliver money sometimes cuz

210
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Oliver didn't have a job

211
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
You know Collective disability from his time in the Marines but

212
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Anyway

213
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
By the beginning of the 70s

214
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
When Oliver got to San Francisco reconnected with an old friend Harvey was shall we say evolving into the hue

215
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
Huge figure their butt gay public figure

216
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm just thinking like one of the things we were talking about on the phone was about sort of the

217
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
The kind of two different

218
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Schools are no different the Segway to that

219
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
Other I would say older but other generation

220
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Okay

221
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Mostly men

222
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Was that

223
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
They were content to go to tea with the mayor or public official of some kind

224
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,039
Wearing jackets and ties really weren't

225
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Shall we say

226
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Activist

227
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
Because according to Ken the activism came

228
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
When in the late sixties early seventies that young gay men and women who came out of the

229
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Vietnam War protests

230
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
Into the world

231
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Take a look around

232
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Discomfort or fear

233
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
The police are still rating bars

234
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
One of them and said we're faget we're going to beat the s*** out of you sending that affect how we going to kill you

235
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Violently in

236
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
And non-violent

237
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
They knock me down and

238
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
Started beating me with their hands in their feet their elbows

239
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Try to muffle my screams

240
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
And

241
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
After a while a body of people get to a point where they just

242
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Will not take

243
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Depression anymore

244
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
So in came the activist like harbin ponytail mustache

245
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Banker turned hippy you know you lying you know you're changing the statements around he was very outspoken

246
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Behind it very militant to Harvey

247
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
A person should have the right to say gay people with living in a half life opportunity

248
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
I am gay that is a part of society. Not being able to be who they were

249
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Must

250
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Does it is you must tell your immediate family

251
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
You must tell your relatives

252
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
You must tell your friends if indeed they are your friends you must tell your neighbors you must tell them

253
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
People your work with you must tell the people in the stories you shopping

254
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Once you do you will feel so much better

255
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
And so

256
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Cut back to September 22nd 1975

257
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
In a blink of an eye Oliver civil becomes this

258
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Hero

259
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
And that same night Oliver spread Harvey

260
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Sears about all this news

261
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
And

262
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Consensus

263
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Wait maybe there's an opportunity

264
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,287
So he picks up the phone and calls

265
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Columnist herb Kane

266
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
A very very well-known well-loved

267
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,063
Gossip columnist isn't there so milk leaves a message on his answering machine

268
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
And he basically says what

269
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
I'm

270
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
A friend of Oliver symbols I've known him for years Oliver Sipple worked on my

271
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Campaign for supervisor

272
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
So basically with without

273
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Sipple's consent

274
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Harvey outage

275
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Milk out of them

276
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
What was Harvey Milk thinking that you do this

277
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,895
Well for Harvey

278
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
Stereotypes the lies the innuendos of gay people as limp-wristed and drag queens and stuff

279
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Distortions

280
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
Okay people to travel us

281
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Ears

282
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
True gay hero us square-jawed heroic Marine seem to be

283
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
Sort of like regular like red-blooded American

284
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,983
I'm so hard reset and this was written down by his biographer of coding

285
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
It's too good an opportunity

286
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
For once we can show that days do heroic things

287
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,967
Not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathroom

288
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,367
What's the difference between no no no no you got to ask the guy for you can just do that

289
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
Harvey just did it

290
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Really

291
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah he just did it

292
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Chicane

293
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
The next morning Kane arrives at his office

294
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
He listens to the message

295
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,703
Teen tries to call simple but he can't reach him

296
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
But there was another guy who is a gay activist his name was

297
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
The Reverend Ray broshears

298
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
He was the head of what's called what was called the lavender Panthers

299
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
And he also independently

300
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Called

301
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Herb team to say

302
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,391
Oh that guy Oliver Sipple ever I'm talking about on the news

303
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Yeah so you got to

304
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,535
Independence vs both of people who said that they were

305
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Friends with Cybill

306
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
And that he

307
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Was gay

308
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
And

309
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
4

310
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Can I think this was juicy

311
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
This was a juicy thing

312
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
And

313
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
He

314
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Go back and get this

315
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
So two days after the assassination attempt

316
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,783
Canes call him comes out and the way that he wrote it up this is the precise paragraph

317
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
What are the heroes of the day Oliver Billy Sipple the ex-marine who grabbed Sarah Jane Moore's arm processor gun was fire

318
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
Tired and thereby may have saved the president's life

319
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,607
Was the center of midnight attention at the Red Lantern a Golden Gate Avenue Bar he favors

320
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Reverend Ray broshears

321
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,983
Head of Helping Hand Center and gay Politico Harvey Milk

322
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Who claimed to be among simple close friends

323
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Describe themselves as

324
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Proud maybe this will help break the stereotype

325
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
And then that day this guy named Darryl Lemke

326
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Left

327
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
Lembke these hurricanes column

328
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
The office of the Los Angeles Times

329
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,303
I was a reporter for the LA Times in San Francisco and

330
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
So

331
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
My office told me

332
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
Got an interview with Oliver Sipple

333
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
But really quickly before we get there

334
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,799
We actually managed to find a recording of this very specific interview

335
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,151
In the Allie X collection at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles and M

336
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
It's the reason they hung onto it was cuz it was

337
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Controversial

338
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,415
So the night that came this article comes out Daryl goes to Oliver's house

339
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,023
Oliver's there are two reporters from The Sentinel were there also

340
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
That right there is Daryl

341
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
Venezuela

342
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,031
The girl sitting in Oliver's living room and end with the reporters are wondering is

343
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,151
Have you heard from the president before husband doesn't bother to thank him at that point

344
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Present an award

345
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
What they call

346
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Medals of freedom

347
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Top streaming apps

348
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Arthur

349
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
Never have me brought back to the White House

350
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Would you like to meet me

351
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Voice right there

352
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
That's

353
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Oliver

354
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
You didn't have time to meet you back

355
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
Have you heard from the mayor

356
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
I'm at the number

357
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,455
I heard only from the press and porters and

358
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
Reporters and pressing that should have been hard

359
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
You have access

360
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
Okay can we go on background

361
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Yeah

362
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
For some reason

363
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
San Francisco Police Department

364
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239

365
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287

Gmail

368
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Something Oliver should know because

369
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,087
This is against at a time when these sumption was that all gay men were just

370
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Pedophiles

371
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Pervert

372
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
I want to set background this is information that cannot be sent

373
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh God Colin Kaepernick

374
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:25,632
Daryl actually asked if he can call somebody and ask about it

375
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
No I don't want

376
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
What you want

377
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Ask you why the number

378
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Who's the guy to talk to

379
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Lochmere Sullivan

380
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Or

381
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
Daryl called local authorities but he can't get ahold of anyone

382
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Robinson

383
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
Do you have any sex crimes on your record

384
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
Never had a sex event in mind that either been arrested mugshot would being drunk a couple

385
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
Is number in Rhode Island

386
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Are there casinos

387
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Recorder goes off

388
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Comes back on

389
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,992
Well who do I call with some Authority

And now all of his on the phone with the police department

392
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
Detective Allen

393
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Yeah well my name is Oliver Sipple

394
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,280
I'd like to know why I've been turned over to your department sex crimes and missing person

395
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352

Yes I'd like to know

398
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
Bunch of breast came over without a bunch of

399
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
This afternoon

400
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
And they said they were trying to get some information about

401
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Police Department

402
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
And I was turned over

403
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Sexy

404
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
What the hell is going on

405
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
OIC

406
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,072
God I mean I said what the hell is going on

407
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,752
I tried to call the mayor's office just now and I tried to call the chief of police office just now

408
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
What the Sam hell is going on

409
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Okay thanks a lot.

410
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Yeah

411
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,456
Just the opposite.

412
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
With the assassination

413
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Assassination

414
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
In that department that's all

415
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
That's why

416
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Stop making sense

417
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
You got me really shut up young man

418
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,584
Just about to go downtown and whip some ass somewhere

419
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
We find out

420
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Now

421
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
The reason is Tampa so controversial is because according to Oliver before the interview began before the you know

422
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
Recorder started rolling

423
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,016
He had said to the reporters from The Sentinel

424
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,600
Okay I'm going to talk to you guys about my sexuality

425
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
But then she had said to Daryl

426
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
I don't want you to write anything about that

427
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
I don't I don't want that International Paper

428
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
Daryl says he doesn't remember that

429
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
But then

430
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Right here in this interview

431
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,984
This thing happens where Darryl says

432
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
I'll make one more try on the gate

433
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
You don't want to change

434
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
You don't want to change your mind on that

435
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
No

436
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
I just don't want to change them

437
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
Very popular saying homosexuality has nothing to do with it

438
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
I'm calling and saying that

439
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,304
If I were a homosexual I was not even cook me or not

440
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
It doesn't make me any less of a man than what I

441
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
But I think they have nothing to do

442
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
React

443
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Rancho

444
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
So I don't think you took anything

445
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,040
Eventually

446
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Okay

447
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Interview ends and

448
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Daryl says

449
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,280
Is that when he left that interview he felt like when I came to all of her sexuality don't want to be quoted

450
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
That was it like just don't

451
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
Quote me on it

452
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,424
But still I was trying to report from all sides about us

453
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
The big side for me was

454
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
That he was a hero on this

455
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,824
The president of States was very slow on the take

456
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
I'm psyching him for saving his life

457
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Darryl thought that

458
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,016
Oliver sexuality the fact that he was gay might have something to do with that because

459
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Just seven months earlier

460
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:33,952
On March 6th Sergeant Leonard matlovich disclosed to a supervising officer at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia

461
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,744
That he was a homosexual

462
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
I wanted to stay in the Air Force

463
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,096
Is Air Force Sergeant named Leonard matlovich

464
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:45,216
Who had the Purple Heart had the Bronze Star he comes out that he's gay

465
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Annie's kicked out of the Air Force

466
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
In conversation

467
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,040
My account

468
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Minority group

469
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
No more America

470
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,144
And now you've got this former Marine saved the president's life and it's

471
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
2 days later he still hasn't heard from the president

472
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
Tilt for Darrell even though Oliver had said don't make this about my sexuality I still thought it was it was a no

473
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
National story and it was

474
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,272
Pretty hard to ignore it after a hurricane and started the ball rolling

475
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
So that night after the interview Darrell calls in his

476
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
Story to the LA Times office

477
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
And he uses this

478
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Raise

479
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
He said to Oliver's of former Marine who was quote

480
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,120
Prominent figure in the gay community

481
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Put it down always the story with the rewrite guy put it in the lead really made it the big thing

482
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
And so

483
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
3 days after the assassination attempt

484
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Ble X run the story with the headline

485
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
No call from president

486
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,808
0 in Ford shooting active among SFGate

487
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
And the only times

488
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
New service

489
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
And so Daryl story it goes

490
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
I mean it goes everywhere

491
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,584
Another strange twist to the story headlines are like

492
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Score

493
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,496
Homosexual hero been reported that the ex-marine who deflected misses more shot on Monday

494
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
Is well known in San Francisco is gay activist circles

495
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
And so it was not just running in Los Angeles it's also running in Chicago it's raining in Dallas

496
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
It's running in Indianapolis and it's running

497
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
You know of all places

498
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
In

499
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Oliver Sipple hometown

500
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
In Detroit

501
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
I guess what I'm wondering is if you have a guy who says

502
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
Please don't talk about this it has nothing to do with what I did yesterday

503
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,704
Shouldn't that play some role in what you decided to write or not to be

504
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Well

505
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,056
You don't know your news sources

506
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Are always

507
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Reluctant to talk

508
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
So I guess I

509
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
Took it as much

510
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Duty

511
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,160
Pick up that angled specially such as Bob the president of the United States

512
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Right

513
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,536
But if you were to do it all over again would you do anything differently

514
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
I don't know

515
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Taken into

516
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Call baby

517
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
The potential harm

518
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Second

519
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
I don't know if I do it over again or not

520
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
But

521
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,952
Not able to turn back the clock for something like that

522
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
Clock marches

523
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Forward after the break

524
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
My name is jazz Adam

525
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm calling from Los Angeles

526
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Radiolab is

527
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,304
Supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

528
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,656
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

529
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,496
More information about Sloane @www.

530
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,800
Slovo.org

531
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,664
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

532
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,784
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

533
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

534
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,256
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

535
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:57,888
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

536
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,496
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

537
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

538
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:14,272
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

539
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,392
Maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

540
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
We're interested in the

541
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Specific moments where

542
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,328
A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

543
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
If you have a story please share it with us

544
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,264

Thank you so much

547
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
This is Radiolab

548
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,048
We're back with the story of Oliver Sipple from reporter producers lot of Nasser

549
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Saudi assassination attempt was on Monday

550
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
And on Thursday

551
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
Simple and his lawyer

552
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Call a Preston

553
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,152
Well I think you all know this is Oliver Sipple and saved the president's life and he has a prepared statement on a subject that's

554
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Appeared

555
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Rest

556
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Today

557
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,856
In the past few days I have been asked many questions having to do with my sexual

558
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Preferences too wet

559
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,744
I've been asked whether or not I am gay or homosexual

560
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
This is

561
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
There is

562
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
This is my reply

563
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
To the line in question

564
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
First reason

565
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
You are

566
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
Interested in my In Me Is

567
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
The Shack

568
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,920
The woman who tried to shoot the president

569
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
Play I'm sorry I'm so nervous excuse me

570
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
This is a handwritten statement and he's having a little difficulty rockstad in order to get it to you

571
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Afternoon

572
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Using your interest

573
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
The fact that I

574
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Oh okay I couldn't get the words

575
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
Drink

576
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,520
My sexual orientation has nothing at all to do with

577
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
Saving the president's life

578
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
Just as the color of my eyes

579
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,504
Or my race has nothing to do with what happened in front of the Saint Francis Hotel on Tuesday

580
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Bisexual

581
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Bisexuality

582
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Is a part of mine

583
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Private life

584
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,304
And I have not I have no

585
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
And has no

586
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
And has no bearing on my

587
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Response

588
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Do the ACT

589
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
Of a person

590
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
Take me to take the life of another

591
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,128
I'm first and foremost a human being who enjoys

592
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
And respect life

593
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
I feel that

594
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
A person

595
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Person

596
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Worth is

597
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Determined by how

598
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
He or she

599
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Response to the world

600
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
In which they live

601
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
Not on how or what

602
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
Or with whom a private life

603
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Is Cher

604
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
He basically says like stop stop

605
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,288
Macy's canvas simple as that

606
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
Makes the whole thing I mean so much more

607
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Personal

608
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
Finally actually was the very reason that Oliver

609
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Call the press conference in the first place

610
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
I want you to know that my mother

611
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Told me today

612
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
But she could not walk

613
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,000
Out of her front door or even go to church

614
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
Because of the pressures

615
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
He fails because of the press

616
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Stories

617
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
Concerning my sexual orientation

618
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Actually I never

619
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Anticipated

620
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Interference with my family's

621
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
Relationship when she died

622
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
When I supposedly say the president's life Oliver would later say that when he was talking on the phone with his mother

623
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
She said to him

624
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
I don't

625
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
Want to speak to you ever again

626
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
And she hung up on him

627
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
And also hung up

628
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,680
Did you call him uncle uncle Oliver

629
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Yes I called the macabre

630
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
Yep this is George Sipple Junior all of his nephew

631
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
She told me that

632
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896
Look at all these families stayed in Detroit

633
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
Albers two brothers and his dad work together in an auto plant

634
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,832
They all work for General Motors in the stories that I've heard is that

635
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Today after Oliver saved the life of President Ford they walked in and everyone wanted to like buy them a beer

636
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
You know everybody on the factory floor

637
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:48,192
Was congratulating them patting them on the back you know your brother's hero your son's a hero

638
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,080
When you know when they would take their their shift break and this is the old days right they take a shift break and they go to the bar and

639
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,896
Everybody wanted to like buy them a round of drinks

640
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:01,248
So then the news comes out at whatever I did couple of days later that

641
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Adhesive

642
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Gay Marine

643
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
And

644
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
There's teasing on the

645
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
On the factory floor

646
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah

647
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah and George says

648
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
What happened is reporters back in Detroit

649
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
Sort of descended on Oliver parent

650
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
To get more of the story until they kept

651
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
Knocking on my granny

652
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Other store

653
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
And she apparently told them to go away

654
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,432
I guess neighbors were harassing her she thought the media was harassing her

655
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,552
My grandmother just said I don't want to deal with it and so don't don't come knock on the door leave us alone

656
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,368
They just wanted to go away and we'll go back to their

657
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Reno private lives

658
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
No one of the things that I found

659
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:48,608
Actually after talking to George wear these interviews done with all of her family after the news broke that Oliver was gay

660
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
And there's just

661
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
Call I just want to read you this one particular Passage

662
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,872
Have you talked to any other members this is from George F Sipple Whois

663
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Oliver Sipple brother

664
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Have you talked to any other members of your family since September 1975 about Oliver

665
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
I mentioned it once to my father

666
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
Question and what was his response what did he say

667
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
If you can remember

668
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,024
I was on afternoons. And I had seen him because I had come in early

669
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Mention the fact

670
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,144
Did the next person that even said he had a son named Oliver

671
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
He was going to literally break their dam neck

672
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,032
Wow so his dad was like

673
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
His brother talking about his dad's react

674
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,528
And he told me quite clearly in two letter words

675
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Just forget you got a brother

676
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
And I let him alone

677
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Never

678
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Anticipated such

679
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Interference with my family's

680
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Relationship with chine

681
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
When I supposed to be saved the president's life

682
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
This is all I have to say on this subject

683
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen any questions and go to

684
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Minister to my lawyer

685
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Like asking a question like this

686
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
What would you what would you like to see

687
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,576
I don't know I'm just embarrassed

688
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,952
I know you have to go and see a doctor over this and I'm very emotional

689
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
I feel very sorry for my family too.

690
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,568
Can you tell us the story of the letter I wish I would have brought it

691
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
I do have it but I didn't bring it today

692
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
The same day is that press conference

693
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,296
Which is 3 days after the assassination attempt Gerald Ford actually did write a letter

694
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
To Oliver Sipple which was then released publicly its a nice letter it's White House stationery White House envelope

695
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
It's basically

696
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,048
Ford telling my uncle that

697
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
You know he's

698
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
Thankful to him for this

699
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
Heroic deed and

700
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
He signed it Jerry Ford witch

701
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,800
I've been told that Gerald Ford

702
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Sign

703
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Different ways

704
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
So if you signed Jerry Ford

705
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,480
It meant something it was like a personal touch

706
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
Listen to other chapter where your uncle

707
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Says

708
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
Set to the president I guess rights found it we found a letter we found a letter in the Gerald

709
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
Ford Library it's from your uncle to the president

710
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Wowhead

711
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Yeah

712
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
I did not I did not know about that letter

713
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,056
Really I have a letter right now so it's it's it's in the date on it is September 30th 1975

714
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
So here's what it says

715
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,152
Dermstore

716
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
It was Wednesday September 30th 1975 so that would be a couple days after you got the letter from Ford

717
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
So obviously

718
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
At the same

719
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,720
He got my grandmother must have hung up on him right

720
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,304
And then he wrote the letter

721
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Cookie cake

722
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
Yeah yeah yeah

723
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:06,496
That's really interesting. Me anytime if you have thoughts

724
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Grandparents

725
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Dear mr. president

726
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
Thank you for taking the time to write to me

727
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
View of some of the events since the unfortunate attempt on your life on Monday September 22nd I really appreciate

728
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
You're publicly thanking me

729
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
As you probably know

730
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,512
There have been a number of stories concerning my personal sexual orientation in the news media

731
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
These stories have caused Great anguish

732
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
To my parents

733
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
And to the rest of my family I am sure

734
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,520
My mother hung up on me when I first called her after the stories begin to be

735
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:47,200
I know you are concerned with very many matters which are two important and pressing for you to be concerned with the details of my pride

736
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Private life

737
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
However the unexpected

738
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
And glaring publicity which is being given to my private life

739
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,440
Has very seriously disrupted my family relationships

740
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,256
Mr. president it is a very hard thing

741
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Tab your mother

742
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
And family

743
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
Not want to have any contact

744
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
With you

745
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
I know that your schedule is heavily occupied

746
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
But I respectfully request

747
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
That you take the time

748
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
See my family or at least call my family

749
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
The telephone number is 3

750
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
Z-ro I love my family and I do not want to be separated from their love and companionship

751
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
Your help will be gratefully appreciated

752
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
Respectfully Oliver W Sipple

753
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
That said

754
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
Saturday think that nothing came of it

755
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
You know

756
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Yeah

757
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
We tried really hard to find out if

758
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,312
Ford ever made that call the

759
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
The archivist at the Ford Library they went through his call logs and there was no evidence that he ever made that call

760
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
ONN

761
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
We talked to George Junior and he talks

762
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,184
You know everybody knows family and they don't remember it either it anyway you can't say for sure but

763
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
As far as we can tell

764
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
That call never happy

765
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
But we did find out

766
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
That the same day that Oliver sent that letter

767
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:47,264
He and his lawyer filed a 15 million dollar lawsuit against

768
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Depress

769
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Really

770
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
Saying same what

771
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
That the newspapers

772
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,967
When they publicize that he was gay

773
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
Without his consent

774
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
They violated his privacy

775
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,647
Okay walking out of civic center Bart

776
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
Honda Civic Center in San Francisco it's just one of those cases where it pulls your head in One Direction

777
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
And it pulls your heart in the exact opposite direction

778
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Until

779
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:19,775
So we wanted to get into the legal case files and we could not find them we look and look and look

780
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,103
And then we found them you found that we found where do you find them

781
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
Cast of the clerk's offices

782
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,991
I guess not surprisingly right off City Hall they were at this

783
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:35,391
Court in San Francisco and we recruited this guy this researcher historian of the gay movement

784
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,743
A great name Joey plaster and he

785
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
Okay so I'm going to need your ID okay

786
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Went and got the files for us and then

787
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
When we turned out there were thousands and thousands upon thousands of pages and everything

788
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
So the issue

789
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
You know it's it's a very fundamental issue for those of us in journalism and to help us make sense of the arguments

790
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
In a lurking in those pages

791
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:06,623
What is privacy in what is invasion of privacy we talked to Dan morain editorial page editor of the

792
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
The Sacramento Bee actually first heard about the case in journalism school and also wrote about Oliver Sipple way back in

793
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
1980s

794
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,863
Anyway okay so here's the first page of the file

795
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,215
The lawsuit was against a Chronicle Oliver W Sipple

796
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Plaintiff vs

797
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,031
Is the chronicle Publishing Company

798
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:30,431
LA times Des Moines Register the Chicago Sun-Times a denverpost Indianapolis Star and a San Antonio

799
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:36,063
Express 180 said this is the deposition of Oliver w

800
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Simple

801
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
See the one of the arguments the lawyers for the newspapers were making is that all of her sexuality was not actually

802
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Chile private

803
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,631
Lawyer were there any people that you knew in San Francisco's and say September 1975

804
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
Who knew that you were homosexual

805
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
Simple yes

806
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,031
Lawyer approximately how many people

807
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
Simple I have no idea

808
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
More than 10 yes

809
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
When it's 50 yes

810
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
More than a hundred

811
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
Yes there were people in New York who knew he was gay there were people in Dallas who knew he was gay

812
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
The settle in the like in the hundred

813
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,975
Did you tell anybody before and September of 1975 that you were homosexual

814
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
If I were asked

815
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
I am asking you

816
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
I don't know what you were asked

817
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,167
And they make the argument the newspapers lawyers that hey this was already

818
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,239
Somewhat public a fact but his

819
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
Personal business was his personal business I've never attempted to obtain publicity for the

820
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:39,039
Fact that I'm gay or predominantly homosexual in my sexual orientation private citizen and made my home app rocks

821
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,111
Ultimately 1800 miles away from home

822
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
But my parents and my family so that I could move so much freely in the gay community without the fact of my sexual orientation getting fat

823
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
To my parents and family

824
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
And it goes on

825
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
But the newspapers need another argument it was like okay

826
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,007
Whether or not you're living a double life whether or not you wanted to or whether or not you had to

827
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,407
There's something here that's bigger than that that's bigger than you which was he was a private citizen who thrust himself

828
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,039
Self as anybody would hope they would do he ran toward the he went toward Danger

829
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
And when he did

830
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:19,487
He also thrust himself into the public eye and a journalist when you're in the public eye

831
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,559
You become something else entirely you become a public

832
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
Ticketmaster

833
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,935
When that happened to Oliver

834
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,287
Lost his right to privacy I'll make one more try on the game

835
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
The music was argued when it came to all of her sexuality

836
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:44,575
It is was and it all printed times has been my judgment that Mr sipple's activities in the gay community

837
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,647
Are highly significant and newsworthy for two important reason

838
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,719
First smartphone

839
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
He was a homosexual

840
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,519
You had this big story about the u.s. Air Force trying to kick this guy Leonard matlovich out because he was gay

841
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,591
Oliver has heard nothing from the president

842
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,431
Present leader said that he thought had nothing to do with all of her being gay

843
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
But the people at the time the suggestion that the president's expression of gratitude to Sybil might have been affected by rumors

844
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:23,231
Activities in the gay community

845
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
Has not yet personally thank them

846
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:31,423
Second lies the innuendos the public display of heroism in saving the life of the president

847
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
United States

848
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
Okay people travel esters

849
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
Presented an image

850
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,615
The gay people are like everybody else that

851
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
They're Heroes image certainly contrary to The Stereotype of persons associated with the gay community as we can done

852
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Heroic figures

853
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:53,439
Which is to say this is newsworthy this is worth knowing and it is something that the whole country wants to know

854
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,535
And and the value of that is more than the value of

855
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:03,167
You know this individual person's privacy do they make sure to put it in terms of the public

856
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,727
Benefit outweighs the private privacy

857
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,543
So Oliver ski

858
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,103
It dragged on for 9 years

859
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,175
So from 1975 to 1984

860
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
But this is

861
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
I'm quoting the judgment

862
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
The record shows that the Publications were not motivated by morbid and Sensational prying into

863
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
To apologize private life

864
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,559
But rather were prompted by a legitimate political concerns

865
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Ie

866
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:36,447
To dispel the boss public opinion that gays were timid we can done heroic figures

867
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
And to raise the equally important political question

868
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:46,175
Whether the president of the United States entertained a discriminatory attitude or bias against a minority group such as home

869
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Bisexuals

870
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
So

871
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
The court

872
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
Cost Oliver's case out

873
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
He lost

874
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Didn't get it.

875
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
Everything about it is weird that

876
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,023
A journalist can just take a person's most private details

877
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
And then if it feels relevant

878
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,375
If they can make that argument they just

879
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:12,031
Put it out there if we did we were to go silent because somebody said don't say that about

880
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:17,919
Then and the government backs him up it is if it's meaningful than the person

881
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,759
Out of which the meaning is being pulled painfully

882
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
Had nothing to say about it that's just because it's really hard and I was thinking about this like even on the train coming

883
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
Over here Daniel Lutz

884
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
And it's like

885
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
The thing that like mixed

886
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,583
Journalism law so complicated in the things that make

887
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,423
An invasion of privacy discussions so difficult is that like

888
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,567
What makes something not an invasion of privacy is not that it's okay it's that it's

889
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
Politically you know releve

890
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,199
So like this with the fact that the story that affected the

891
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
Private details of his life

892
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
AR

893
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Politically relevant

894
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
Memes

895
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
That it's not an invasion of privacy

896
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
You know it doesn't mean that it isn't rude or that it doesn't hurt

897
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
It means

898
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
That it's

899
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
Inappropriate

900
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
Story 2 video

901
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Publix

902
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,983
But I do think like why should the journalist be the only ones to decide what is newsworthy it's not like

903
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
Why is it that then

904
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,311
Journalist you

905
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
You just pick up a notepad and pencil and all the sudden you have so much more power to say what say of

906
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,503
Then than anybody else

907
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:32,159
Well I mean we have a long tradition of that in the United States I mean like that's

908
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,951
Like what the first amendment is

909
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
I mean

910
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:39,327
I don't know means like yeah sure like it's like why do journalist get to decide that will like

911
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
Who would you rather have decided

912
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,423
It's not a perfect system but it's

913
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
You know

914
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
It kind of works

915
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:51,871
So so is Oliver just like this this is Tracy hunt it was in on the interview somebody who

916
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,711
Life is basically kind of sacrifice to the altar of the First Amendment and it's like

917
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
Sad way

918
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Yes

919
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Yeah

920
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
I feel like he was sacrificed from all sides

921
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Yeah

922
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,935
It it feels like there's just one kind of man in the middle and then they're all these

923
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
Forces around him these like

924
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,567
These larger-than-life forces like

925
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,127
The White House there's the gay movement

926
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
Freedom of the press

927
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,319
NN all these people are our sort of batting around all these all these enormous and important abstractions and then

928
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
In the middle of it

929
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
This guy that just

930
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,951
Is trampled by all of them and so what ends up happening to him in the end

931
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,791
Apparently some people in the gay community

932
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
During and after the lawsuit

933
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
Tell that he was trying to go back in the closet so they sort of

934
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Turn their backs on him

935
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,151
Surprisingly he was friends with Harvey Milk till till the ends like

936
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
When Harvey Milk was assassinated

937
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
Oliver Sipple went to his funeral

938
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:09,439
He did have one brother George senior who stuck by him throughout but but his parents

939
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
Did not

940
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,303
And they never fully accepted the fact that he was gay and end

941
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
To when his mom died

942
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,167
It was so bad that

943
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,007
Oliver suppose father didn't let him go to the funeral

944
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
And because he he sort of

945
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
He had so far

946
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,687
So few people I guess at the end and because there weren't

947
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,271
You know a lot of news articles about him and

948
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,903
Cuz a lot of people in the gay community from that time have died because of the AIDS

949
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Craigslist

950
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,487
It was really hard to find out what

951
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
Happened to Oliver Sipple nose last

952
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
5 years of his life

953
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
And

954
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
The only way we could was because

955
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:57,055
When you were talking to Daniel Lutz already mentioned this interview that he did with this guy named Dwayne Friday

956
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
He was a friend of Oliver

957
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Wing Friday was sort of like a

958
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,735
Pillar of the community in San Francisco like a pillar of the gay community and then also has heard of

959
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
Political figure and he was like

960
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
Coffin you know he was he was at Heathrow

961
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
Fingers in every pie

962
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
All kind of thing

963
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:18,559
Wayne died last year but Daniel still had the transcript of their conversation about Oliver Sipple

964
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,119
Last days until

965
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
We found it after

966
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
Very gifted Gordon pinsent

967
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
And we had him read it for

968
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
Okay let me have a go

969
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,135
I forget was 1975 the Sarah Jane Morris

970
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975

971
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
He was a Swamper I like gay bar, Coughlin

972
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
Swampert is used to clean the bars at night

973
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,983
Set the bar low for the next bartender in the morning

974
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,591
Do it three different bars he was always at the bar

975
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Unsane

976
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,711
We actually became friends because we discovered we were both from Michigan

977
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
There was a good guy

978
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,671
It was just so f****** alcoholic I made against disability check once a month

979
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,303
How do you go down one of the bars in the tenderloin but I used to hang out with cough Queen Mary's Pub

980
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,863
He told the other day got his check

981
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Swear to God

982
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
Hit hit spend this whole fucken Jack on everybody

983
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,055
How do you get broke the rest of the month they just couldn't control himself

984
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,151
And he was a little bit of a blowhard that I always e

985
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,735
Get drunk and loud Guitar Center bars

986
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,063
I used to drive me home

987
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
Hidden department on Van Ness

988
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,903
Had a little Studio.

989
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,975
I want bedroom on the first floor at about Turk

990
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:56,095
He drunk I'm going to have at the bar and I driving home so I always knew where you live

991
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,751
And that's why this thing was forwarded really f***** his mind.

992
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,591
Broken guy after that the whole thing work.

993
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
The publicity of them all

994
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
The fact that everyone knew he was a faget dinner

995
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
He said to be a couple of times

996
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:19,647
I went to the Marine Corps and I got hurt and now what am I known for being a faget

997
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
And I said no you're not

998
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,511
You're known for saving the president's life

999
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,863
She won't be known for what you did in bed for Christ's sake

1000
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,959
But he would get drunk and then stop bemoaning that

1001
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,799
I just talked to him about it amen

1002
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
It is what it is

1003
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
But he was just

1004
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
He was just

1005
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
Down to nothing

1006
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
This thing happen

1007
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
Andrew overcame him

1008
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
Too much for him to handle

1009
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,975
And I think he got the feeling sorry for himself

1010
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Annies family

1011
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:03,679
Many a night I would sit in the bar with build simple and he's crying your shoulder and you'd say Okay symbol

1012
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
It's time to go home

1013
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
And then I drive home now

1014
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
I remember it was raining

1015
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
It was pouring f****** rain

1016
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,791
Bruce called me at my office over at the DA's office and said when

1017
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,887
Will you do a well-being check on simple for me and I said why

1018
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,703
How do you say nobody's saying the dude

1019
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
You haven't been around for awhile

1020
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,103
So we go out there together and it was raining

1021
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
And I'm ringing the bell ringing the bell ring

1022
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,711
He doesn't answer

1023
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,319
I noticed on his door there with these little stick'em things posted

1024
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
Elliot Big Friend of this little old lady

1025
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,463
Who lived next door they kind of looked after each other

1026
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,071
And she left all these notes Bill call me I can't get a hold of you

1027
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,399
So I rang the managers Bell

1028
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,959
And with little Filipino guy

1029
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,543
I showed him my badge and I said you got to let me in

1030
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
And so he did

1031
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,687
And the door opened and I know what was going on

1032
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
It's the smell

1033
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
It's a smell

1034
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
You never forget

1035
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
It's a sickening sweet

1036
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
Smell

1037
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,791
Bill was sitting in the chair

1038
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,119
He was bluffing

1039
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,935
Is bloating a real big

1040
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
Yeti bottle of Jack Daniels sitting there

1041
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
And the television was still on

1042
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,479
The coroner told me he'd been dead

1043
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
About 10 days

1044
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
As near as I can figure

1045
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,743
God I didn't know he was only 47

1046
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
I thought he was older than that

1047
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Anyway

1048
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
I got the guy to open the door for me

1049
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
Adam energy did I said

1050
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Troponin

1051
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
And then I had to stand there

1052
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
Android for the car

1053
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,559
I remembered it was over here at the Campbell funeral home at Market

1054
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Straight

1055
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,191
And then we buried him out in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno

1056
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
And I remember

1057
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
Is very small

1058
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
Casket wasn't open

1059
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
The funeral was just

1060
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
I'm in

1061
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,855
There were more millionaires

1062
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,231
I seen them buy drinks for more people than we're at that funeral

1063
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,095
He could have been buried in Arlington if they made an issue out

1064
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,775
I mean shut that he was this National icon a gay whatever

1065
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
It was just a few people

1066
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Out there

1067
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
The funeral

1068
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
I believe in human life

1069
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
And I think that this country stands for human

1070
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Diets

1071
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,663
Including life and freedom

1072
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,271
I'm first and foremost a human being who enjoys

1073
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
And

1074
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
Respect life

1075
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,135
Fifield

1076
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,183
