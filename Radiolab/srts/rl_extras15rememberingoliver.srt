1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:07,680
We want to finish the night with a salute to a guy who's been on our program and part of our family pretty much from the beginning

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,216
I have known him

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,520
Morgan 35 years

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:17,152
Early I'm going to Radiolab started I asked him if he'd help us out and send us a few story ideas he didn't send us a few

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
He sent us bushel

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
Tales of chemistry in medicine

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,552
Hallucinations music people so many

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,136
Extraordinary people that he knew founder help

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
Cuz I just doesn't run out

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Dr. Oliver Sacks

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
Neurologist author

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,424
Is a guy who notices

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,056
Everything is deeply interested in everything that happens around him and to him and tonight we're bringing it back on tape

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,152
But what the last may be his final offering Frost as many of you know

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
Dr. Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver cancer

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,320
Have you wrote about this in the New York Times he said he plans to spend the time that he has

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Left writing

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,952
Be with friends not doing interviews but he did agree to share his thoughts

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
Exclusively with that with us tonight

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
For you to gather here

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Cuz he's one of our family

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,192
So as I've done for decades now I went over his house in Manhattan with my mic

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Am I sent to him

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
I just need to know what just

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
A month-and-a-half ago you were fine

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
And then

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
What

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
I see beginning of the ride was fine

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
On the 3rd of January I feel Canelo

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Quia

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
And I tossed some dark urine

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,232
I thought I said little girl bladder attack

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
Didn't pay that much attention

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
But thought I better get things

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
And then

36
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
The X-ray with

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
Expected only to show a couple of ghosts

38
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Chode

39
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
I'm drugs

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Off 6th

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
And my liver

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Iolo my doctor said

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
He didn't know what his will and I would need further tests

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
I

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
I knew what they were

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
I said it's hot

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
He's right the doctors eventually confirmed

48
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,864
A cancer that has been found in his eye 9 years ago had spread to his liver

49
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Were you

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Peyton

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Or

52
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,848
Relieve or consor

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
I think my first feeling was one of

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Overwhelming sadness

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
They're also things

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
I will see

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
And I will do

58
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
One or two people have listened to me in the

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,536
Controlling me

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
But f*** it it's not like we all die

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
It's like you have four months

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Has that has your property is your prognosis at this moment cuz I know you had an well if it gets revived

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,712
It depends of course on how is the cancer response to treatment sand

64
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
Or how quickly it spreads

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Sofa

66
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
The metastasis from my eye

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Only in my liver

68
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
I told they love liver

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
The Isle of liver as well

70
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,352
And then one of the magical things I did was going to have to live for Nom Noms

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
Sudoku

72
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm thinking that liver looks better than mine Parkway

73
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
This is what he's like instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him he's thinking about loving liver and liver lover

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
Looking for Connections in one really doesn't stop he

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
He just notices it case in point

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
A few months ago

77
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
His doctor said to him We're going to run up a line

78
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,000
Up your liver and ineffective going to straight shave off or start some of the cancer cells first on one side

79
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Going to be out there to see if I can give you a little more time

80
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
But they warned him honesty metastasis

81
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Die

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
The hutong farias and Pleasanton

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Send me exhaust you text your system bad

84
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
And at one point shortly after the procedures

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
I started talking and it off

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Strangely

87
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
And as I was talking I was inviting

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
You'll be the first person to see this

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,952
So he showed me a notebook we're showing it to you

90
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
In just a moment you can see their sort of

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,631
Writing there on the left it's all he's writing a book actually children's book about the elementary table

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
But as he was writing if you if you look to the next

93
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Page

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
I see that it gets a little bit

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
Wobbly the letters and then

96
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
And then there was some

97
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Crossing out there

98
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Yes I see all the dramatics

99
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Do icing

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Changes

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
It actually is

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
There's a large

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,439
Slash across it and then you get seems a little incoherent at the palace

104
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Okay

105
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Edible

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Advantage delivery

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Krypton made

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
All this happened to the course of 10 minutes

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,031
He's doing here he's figured okay I'm writing at a constant speed

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
I know pretty much how fast I write and so I can time this out I can figure out exactly how long it took me to sleep

111
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Into delirium out of this delirium

112
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Animal Medical Way

113
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
I think this was a lovely illustration

114
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
Who puts in a timeline of delirium

115
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Coming like that

116
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
When are you more likely

117
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Unusual for any doctor and a man of science you don't seem too worried at all

118
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Become incoherent or strange

119
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,175
You're not showing it to me as it's like how interesting I was crazy here for a little bit

120
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,807
The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there

121
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,927
I went time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike and by the way I I should

122
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
Show you what you look like back then when he was

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
Driving his bike is I think it's him

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
In New York

125
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
I kind of you know

126
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Hello

127
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,263
In the sixties he was also a champion weightlifter they called him doctor Squad

128
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,639
And in this picture that you saw you here that's him raising 600-lb

129
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
In order to win a trophy like this is that that you was a champ and

130
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:17,855
And you can see more pictures like these cuz we have signed copies of all of his new Memoir out for sale in the lobby

131
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,951
Pretty good book too by the way this time

132
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
And 1960s

133
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
In addition to being muscled out however

134
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Was a serious recreational drug take

135
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
And because he's Oliver

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,239
He was extremely curious about his high as no matter how weird they were

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
1 time for example he took

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
20 pills that he shouldn't have

139
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,151
And then to my surprise

140
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
How does a spider on the wall

141
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Set hello

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Have a voice like that she's also

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Famous mathematician

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
And the tongue

145
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
It cost me a lot of the technical question as to whether Russell had a

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Exploded

147
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Frigga spavital

148
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
And we had this

149
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
Conversation

150
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
Cuz you you trust your perceptions

151
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,687
Mineo's later when I mentioned this to an entomologist friend Cornell

152
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Philosophical spider

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
Taking it all in talking spiders

154
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Whatever the generosity of his curiosity

155
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
Becomes profoundly moving and transformative

156
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
What he's treating his patients I want to tell

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
1 * here really quickly do to demonstrate what I mean

158
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
I never once had a patient when he called mrs. OC

159
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
She was

160
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
An old woman she was 88 years old living in a nursing home

161
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
And one night she was awakened Jarred awake by a loud sound

162
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
I wish

163
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,487
Hillsong

164
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
And she thought about somebody left the radio on but when she looked

165
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
3D when the room is Oscar roommate

166
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
Soundasleep which was odd because the song was really loud

167
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,567
The doors after that

168
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
It was another song

169
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Another song

170
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
Leaving my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are

171
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
Are coming to the fillings in my teeth I've heard that's possible

172
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
But no her doctor told her

173
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
This is something in your head you need to see

174
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
A neurology

175
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Which led her to doctor sax

176
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
That when he met mrs. OC he she could barely hear him the song sung by the female voice for coming and coming she

177
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
He was frightened and justifiably worried that you was going crazy but Oliver said no no I'm going to do some tests and when he was done

178
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
He said he found a slight stroke or condition that triggered musical epilepsy 87 production of music and

179
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Your brain

180
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Normal. You might say Okay me about the diagnosis and he thought that the songs would probably faint it'll pass or they would be

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
But Oliver did not stop

182
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
He doesn't stop

183
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,191
He kept talking to her

184
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born her mother when she

185
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,711
He was only 5 she was sent to America

186
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
Look for the water for beating Mason.

187
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,647
She had no conscious memory of the first five years of my life

188
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
New memory of Ireland

189
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
You should always help us as a kid and painful side

190
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Lack of forgetting

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Efficacy

192
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
We asked her about the songs

193
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
What are they like

194
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
I miss Associated well I think they're lullabies

195
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Can you sing them for me she did

196
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,991
And then after checking them not sure who I'll ever figured out that these songs what happened to be popular

197
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,343
Irish ballads from the 1890s when Mrs OC was a little baby

198
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
And I gave him an idea

199
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Isn't science

200
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
It isn't in any traditional way medicine

201
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
He just told her a story

202
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
And it goes like this

203
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,167
You don't have nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three

204
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
Well there was a Siri wants not honored much today but it's sad that those earliest memories

205
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
Get locked away deep in our brains in a special safe

206
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
The weekend never open

207
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
So let's suppose mrs. OC

208
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
And you are struck by some

209
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Reezy chance

210
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Open the lock that none of us can break

211
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
And release those first memories

212
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
In you just for a little while

213
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
So that the voice you're listening to

214
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Home

215
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Maybe that isn't a radio voice

216
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Let's play

217
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
That it's your mother's voice

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
That's true missing mother

219
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,127
Enjoy the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms

220
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
You get to be a baby again

221
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Images of the Seas thought about

222
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Okay

223
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
It's sort of fits

224
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
I'm an old woman with a stroke

225
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Can an old people's home

226
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
But I feel I'm a child in Ireland

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
I feel my mother's arms I see

228
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Ikea voicing

229
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
United

230
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
Shortly thereafter the songs began to fade the pauses widen

231
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Miss Associated been so frightened by this music in her head was now

232
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
Sorry to see the songs go

233
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
But it was Oliver who noticed how those songs that touched

234
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,927
Who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does

235
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
He listens close

236
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
He can hear another person's

237
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
And this is really the profound puzzles for me

238
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
About Oliver

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,007
Because reading the new autobiography you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life

240
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
Linear relationships that really mattered

241
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
It turns out he didn't get a whole lot of effect

242
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,199
He was for a long time a lonely guy I'd say he was

243
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Very lonely

244
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
And he's talking about that now for the 1st

245
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Let me talk about love for a minute

246
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
In this book you tell the story of your

247
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Of your very first love of fellow by the name of Richard

248
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Selleck

249
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Can you just tell me

250
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
What happened with

251
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,983
He was a load Scala I talked with him.

252
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
A poet

253
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
And handsome

254
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Beautiful

255
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Beyond belief

256
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
An eyesore

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Fell for him

258
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Although I didn't say anything

259
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Because I was from

260
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
Very haunted by my mother

261
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Accusations

262
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
What is your mother

263
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Well

264
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
To go to a couple of years back then my father

265
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,375
How to open the conversation I was about to go to Oxford

266
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Father son

267
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Conversation

268
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Any setup

269
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
You don't seem to have many girlfriends

270
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
And I said

271
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
No

272
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Wishing the conversation

273
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Stop

274
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
He said I'm

275
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Something's wrong with girls

276
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
Semi I said know that that's fine

277
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Tattoo prefer boys

278
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
And I said well

279
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Yes I do

280
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
I said I've never done anything

281
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
But I do

282
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,327
Then you knew that then I knew that then I'd know.

283
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
6 euros

284
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Probably sometime

285
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
What's 12

286
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
And I said don't tell Mom

287
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
She won't be able to take it

288
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
But my

289
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Father

290
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Did tell my mother in the night

291
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
And the next morning she came down with him

292
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
I somehow want to see the face of humba

293
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Enraged me

294
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
And among other things said

295
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
Joann Abomination I wish you would never been born

296
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
And then she has something to shut up

297
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
And said nothing for 3 days

298
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
And

299
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
The match was never mentioned the game and highlight

300
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Anthem

301
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
2 years later

302
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
I found myself

303
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
First time in my life

304
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Falling in Love

305
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
This was the gun guy Richard

306
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
Oliver the time was in college

307
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
It was a very positive feeling why didn't know what it was one which I did Express

308
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
But I did

309
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Say so with my heart my mouth

310
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,047
To what you said

311
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
And Richard

312
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
Clipped me by the shoulders and he said I know

313
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
He said but I'm not that way

314
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
But I love you in my own way

315
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
And I was glad I have said that I'm glad this has been received in such a warm February

316
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
I thought you might be friends for the rest of all

317
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Lives

318
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
But then one day he came into me said he'd been bothered by finding a lump

319
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,951
In his groin and he was worried

320
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Could I have a look at it

321
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
And I looked at it and I felt it

322
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
And it was hard on

323
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Tethered

324
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Turned out to be a

325
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Tiki malignant

326
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
Form of lymphoid T-Mobile

Sarcoma

329
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Anthem

330
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
He never spoke to me again often

331
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
I don't know whether

332
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
Since I've been the first to recognize the ominous impulse

333
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
He's told me about

334
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Harbinger of death or messenger of death

335
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
What happened

336
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
But you you were left with the with the child

337
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Yeah yeah yeah

338
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,119
Few years later album medicine man they mellings young he was a sailor

He liked Oliver he was into weightlifting they became close friends

340

And they began living together and was in love with him and love

341
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
Physical contact with him and leave work out and they dressel and ride motorcycles kind of tightly and never talked to

342
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
About what might or might not be happening between them but one day

343
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
They were together and Oliver was giving Mel a back massage with smell off and asked him to do and

344
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
I love doing that

345
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
And Oliver says sometimes he get a little

346
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
You know

347
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071

And so love to say gave no excuses indication it was okay

349
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
But but but one day

350
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Things went a bit too far

351
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
And I got soda

352
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
I went over the bridge just before the Big Bang

353
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,431
Metal immediate resources. Happen

354
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
How to shower

355
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Adam said I icon

Don't stay with you anymore

357
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
And then I found that

358
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Very

359
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Cool and upsetting I'm hot

360
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
And it's made me feel

361
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
I don't want to have anything to do with

362
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
People

363
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
I must have

364
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119

Again

367
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031
And he didn't share his life with anyone for a long long time

368
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
In fact

369
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
He told me a story about something that happened

370
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
Maybe 8 years ago

371
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
I had I was just joining The Faculty of Columbia

372
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
And I was having a

373
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
An interview

374
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
And at one point the interview

375
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
She said I have something weather

376
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Private Law School

377
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Would you like Miss Edgar

378
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
Your system to leave and I said no she's

379
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Pb2

380
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Or my affairs

381
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
And I did say

382
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Thinking she was going to ask me about 6

383
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
I said I haven't had any sex

384
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
What's 35

385
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,247
I've been sacked when she was going to ask me my social security number

386
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,071
Tell the truth is I didn't do anything about it because he didn't think he could I be chosen Richard lost Richard

387
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
Chosen mail lost mail what is the point he was thinking

388
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
Finally and who knows

389
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
Waiting for why these things happen to people

390
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
But a man came along who for the first

391
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Chose Oliver

392
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
I admit bilious I miss a number of people because I've been

393
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
A manuscript or proof

394
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
A book

395
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
And I'm in intimacy grew between us

396
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,767
I don't think I quite realized how deep it was but then there was a particular episode

397
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
In Christmas of 09

398
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Meineke

399
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Kmart

400
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
And in his

401
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Serious

402
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Way she has a serious

403
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Is careful what you say

404
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
He said I

405
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
I have conceived a deep

406
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Love for you

407
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
I have conceived

408
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
I got a few extra words I have

409
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,439
Okay was he scared to say I love you

410
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
You know she likes the English language

411
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Input

412
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
More cautiously and yet most strongly

413
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
I think that's a beautiful way of putting it

414
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
And then I realized

415
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
At that moment with his

416
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Saying that

417
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
But I had conceived a deep love

418
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
And I

419
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Good God has happened the game

420
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
And I'm in my 77th year

421
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
Next and things

422
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
Basically have gone

423
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
Happily ever since

424
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
Unsurprising meme

425
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,903
Because then again I'm not dealing with or what I'm dealing with a food

426
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
I'm dealing with an individual

427
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
I'm not dealing with a with a condition defined by medicine

428
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Hello

429
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,079
So Oliver still doesn't know how much time he has left but for the moment as you can hear

430
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
His mind is totally impact you still riding he has two books in addition to the one you find in the lobby that he's writing and the

431
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Children's books

432
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
Bunch of New Yorker stories in last few months and a New York Review of Books story

433
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,951
He's got energy to spare so I want to do one last thing for we close

434
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,071
And this comes from yet another conversation I had with him it's a story I know Oliver wood Heat

435
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Because he's not a capital I religious

436
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
But he is somebody

437
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Who definitely Embraces mystery and for a long time

438
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
He's been mystified by a color called

439
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Indigo

440
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Indigo

441
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Which Newton had inserted

442
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Between blue and violet

443
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
I know no two people seem to agree as to what

444
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Indigo was like

445
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
And then

446
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:48,511
So I built a episode of chemical Launchpad meaning took a lot of

447
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
Face of amphetamine

448
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
Genital arousal

449
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Vincent asset

450
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
Analytical cannabis

451
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
And when I was fishing today

452
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Stones

453
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
I said I want to see

454
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Indigo

455
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
No

456
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
As if in reply

457
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:14,367
Does it feel by giant paintbrush to appear. Huge trembling

458
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Pear-shaped blog

459
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
Of what I instantly realized

460
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Was pure

461
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Indigo

462
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Are on the White Horse in front of me

463
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
It had a wonderful luminosity

464
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,264
And in particular I am a religious person

465
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
I thought

466
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
This is the color of Heaven

467
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,432
And I live water ecstasy

468
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
And then suddenly disappear

469
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
He says he had one more moment like that this time no drugs

470
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,976
He was in a museum staring at an Egyptian artifact he sees this read and color back again just for a Beat

471
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
I was given 5 tantalizing seconds

472
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,608
Of of radian ineffable

473
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
Beauty and then again it Banner

474
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
And that was 1965

475
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
And I've never seen in to go soon

476
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
But who knows you know

477
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Sunday

478
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
I like the

479
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,944
Dr. sacks make it to see that color

480
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Again
