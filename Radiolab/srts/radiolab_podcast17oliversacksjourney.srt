1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,584
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,088
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich it's his Radiolab so Robert one of my favorite sounds

4
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
Of all time in the sound of hearing people think

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
You know of a

6
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
Hearing a mind kind of formulate a thought

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
It wasn't there

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,960
Until it clicks in yeah that's just going to be a beautiful sound especially when the mines are you listening to

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,056
Is a person who has shaped you as shaped the show sure

10
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
So today a little bit of departure a couple of months ago I got connected to a guy named

11
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
Bill Hayes mutual friends or put us in touch. A really good book actually about Anatomy music

12
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
If I give it to my son really

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,048
He is a writer and a photographer and I was the partner of the Late Oliver Sacks

15
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
And together we made

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:12,192
Tapes or recordings of conversations in the last year of his life

17
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,080
Now Oliver Sacks one of the great great writers of Science and masterful

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,176
Masterful writer Radiolab of grown up with him

19
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
That ended his style of combining sort of clinical scientific observation with

20
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
Deep Humanity in poetry

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
I feel like we're always trying to walk in his footsteps in some way

22
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,888
Many many times that his voice will be familiar to a lot of you but what you hear

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
On these tapes

24
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
Is an altogether different portrait

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,336
And why why did you start these recordings

26
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
Oliver got his diagnosis of terminal

27
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,992
Cancer in mid January 2015

28
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
He had had cancer about nine years earlier dealt with it

29
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
But it was back

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,696
It's spreading to his body the prognosis was 6 to 18 months

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
And thought it was shattering

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,912
Shortly after bill says they were sitting at the kitchen table talking

33
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,520
Things on his mind that he wanted to write I said well what do you what do you thinking about writing this is about

34
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,872
4 days after he got his diagnosis and he paused

35
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
And then he looked at me and he said

36
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Something like

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
A month ago I felt that I was in good health

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Even robots Dallas

39
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
881 I still swim a mile a day

40
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
But my luck has run out

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
And

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
I said stop right there

43
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
And I grab the pad and a pen

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
And I said start over

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
And I began writing as fast as I could

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Has he dictated

47
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Virtually the entire essay

48
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,312
Desserts spelled out like that

49
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
So we had the idea of getting a little audio recorder digital recorder

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,040
So they could be on hand at any time whether to record what he want to write

51
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Or reminisce or

52
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,440
To collect stories after his death I put the recorder in a drawer

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,280
And didn't pull it out again until

54
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Over a year-and-a-half after his death I didn't even listen to it

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Any event to write my own memoir

56
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,056
I have been kind of very nervous about listening to them cuz I thought I'd be very sad just that we're just

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Make me depressed and sad

58
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,968
But I took it I took the recorder out of the drawer where you had sat for 18 months and

59
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Cypress playing of course it didn't work because the batteries were dead so I had to scramble to find batteries and when

60
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
When I did and then

61
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Push play

62
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,048
Okay this is a recorded conversation

63
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
Between ows

64
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Play

65
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
Chinese I mean

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
The hairs on my arms

67
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Went off

68
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
It was as if he was alive this is the first recording you made it was eating at the

69
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
Time and he began telling me about his dreams

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Dream

71
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184

72
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Archetypal dreams

73
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
I have to make

74
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
No

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
Getting lost from

76
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
I guess you found

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Full of surprises to maybe

78
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407

79
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,271
I'm tired of fighting with being so

80
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Very religious

81
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
But then finally coming to some

00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
And then waking

86
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Dreams about Journey's

00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679

00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
The journey from where to where

89
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
This was February 6th 2015 show about 3 weeks after Oliver got his diagnosis

90
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Terminal cancer

91
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,927
And his immediate impulse was to write

00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047

My mind

95
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Oliver was quite deaf

96
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,943
Even louder than he realized he would whisper words to himself trees

97
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
As he wrote them down on the pad and you wrote with a fountain pen

98
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,327
For Oliver writing was a form of thinking and the primary activity

99
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
For human being

00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447

OK Google a slime read something to you

156
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
A general feeling of disorder

157
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
It is especially when things are going wrong internally

158
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
When homeostasis is not being maintained when the autonomic balance starts listing heavily to one side or the other

159
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
It is core Consciousness the feeling of how one is takes on an intrusive unpleasant quality

160
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
And now one will say I feel something is amiss at such times one India

161
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
Everything comes and goes and if one could take a scam or in a photograph of the body at such times when was he

162
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
Vascular beds opening and closing peristalsis accelerating or stopping is there a squirming or tightening

163
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Spasms secretion suddenly increasing or decreasing is if the nervous system itself or the state

164
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
Weight of indecision instability fluctuation and oscillation are of the essence in the unsettled state

165
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
This feeling of disorder we lose the normal feeling of the procedure the relatively benign would lead to the death of

166
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
The huge mass of melanoma cells bees and dying would give off a variety of unpleasant and pain producing so

167
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Substances

168
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Soon after waking from the embolization

169
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
I was to be assailed by feelings of excruciating tiredness

170
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
In frocks isms of sleep so abrupt

171
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Pick-n-Pull asked me in the middle of a sentence

172
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Or a mouthful

173
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Delirium with sees me within seconds

174
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Even in the middle of handwriting

175
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
I felt extremely weak

176
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
And inert

177
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Monday 10

178
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
I turned a corner I felt awful as usual in the morning but a completely different person in the afternoon

179
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
This was delightful and wholly unexpected I suddenly found myself full of physical and creative

180
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Energy and Euphoria almost akin to hypomania exuberant thoughts rushed through my mind

181
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
How much of this with re-establishment of balance in the body how much an autonomic rebound after a profound

182
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
Autonomic depression how much other physiological factors and how much the sheer Joy of writing

183
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
I do not know

184
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
But my transform State and feeling were I suspect very close to Whitney she experienced after a. Of

185
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Illness espresso lyrically in the gay science gratitude course for

186
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
Earth continually as if the unexpected had just happened the Gratitude of a convalescent for convalescent

187
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
This was unexpected the rejoicing of strength that is returning every waking faith in Ottumwa

188
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow of a sudden sense and anticipation of a future of impaired

189
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
Pending Adventures of seas that are open again

190
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,831
I'm wasted Wednesday microphone on this bloody thing

191
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647

Meantime

And it is Monday tonight

195
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
And that's to say the 20th day

196
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
After my embolization

197
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
And. 48 hours

198
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079

Force

201
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
On March 11th Oliver had the second embolization surgery which would cut off blood supply to the tumor

202
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Growing in his liver

203
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
With the idea that it would give all of her

204
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
More time

And yet

208
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527

213
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479

217
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
Was younger

218
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
I wish I could choose to test my age

219
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
Okay

220
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,991
The New Yorker yes

221
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
I like the idea of staying exactly two thirds my age

222
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
Affection

223
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Three courses yes but not 2/3 I like the idea of putting a tiny Iris Medical

224
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Conundrum

225
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359

Published March 20th 2015

227
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Driving down 9th Avenue

228
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
Choking on diesel fumes from a truck just ahead of us

229
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
I say to my friend Billy he's exactly two thirds my age

230
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
I wonder whether you will see the end of internal combustion engines

231
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
The end of oil

232
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
A Cleaner World

233
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,631
The thought zooms me away from 9th Avenue to a forest world

234
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,983
A particular to the one described in that glorious Forest

235
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,823
To Gillian Francis book about his 39 visits to the Amazon

236
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
The past 50 years

237
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
He sees what we are doing to the Amazon and its many peoples

238
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Speak for conservation

239
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Sanity

240
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Reason before we destroy it all

241
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
I went to that glorious forest in 1996 11 days of Botany study and hiking

242
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
Sing hundreds of different species of trees in a single acre

243
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
I planned before I became ill

244
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
Go to Madagascar to see its 4

245
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
Annie's Unique fun and other wildlife

246
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Especially the lyrics

247
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
I love lemurs

248
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Would have to see them

249
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Study them

250
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
Graph the origin of our primate nature

251
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,247
But most of the forest on Madagascar have already been obliterated

252
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
And not a naturally

253
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Lemurs are dying

254
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Honking horns bring me back to 9th Avenue

255
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
I seem to spend hours lost in reverie

256
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
Thinking about the Amazonian a madagascan forest

257
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Lemurs

00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
The Time Machine

259
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
We have scarcely moved

260
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Are still behind the stinking long destroying truck

261
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Not in my life

262
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103

On Thursday

270
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
I was terrified to this

271
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,663
In fact was it did show was that 80% of the metastasis in the liver

272

I'm have been destroyed by the embolization

273
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
With luck I should have two or three

00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Good maps

275
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879

Ovulation

Who I want to hear I want to hear

289
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103

The three of them a type of special function

293
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
To record abnormalities perception

294
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
During times of sensory impairments for deprivation

295
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
The calendar book

296
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Is there a modest affair

297
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,631
Does quite small chips easily into a pocket

298
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Crucial

299
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
If I need to have it with me at all times

300
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Increasing decimals

301
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
A normal phone to mishear what people say

302
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
But missed hearing the Devon entirely

303
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
You kept what you hear you except what you see every mishearing is a novel surprising concoction

304
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
I never get used to them

305
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Refresh

Take the car for a spin

309
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,751
I can't take the conference room I've noted that

310
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,591
This is beautiful

311
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Terracon sick time publishing has heard of the big-time cuttlefish

I need $5 to put the mall in I think they should

314
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
Format will make the point

315
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
The sound

316
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Humps everything

317
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
When surroundings one's wishes and expectations conscious and unconscious can certainly Biko determine

318
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Shenzhen miss hearing

319
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
But the real mr. flies at lower levels

320
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
In those parts of the brain involved in phonological analysis and decoding doing what they can with distorted or deficiency

321
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
Signals from our ears these parts of the brain manage to construct real words or phrases even if they are absurd

322
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,120
And yet there is often the sort of style or Witt

323
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,728
A dash annies instantaneous inventions they reflect to some extent

324
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
One's own interests and experiences

325
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
I rather enjoy them

326
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,408
Only in the realm of mishearing at least my Miss hearings

Into oral numbness

330
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
And a mere mention of Christmas Eve

331
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
A command to kiss my feet

00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472

You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you or maybe the kid was at piano lessons and you said

Only noticed they were doing math class
