1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:08,448
What is it

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:16,640
Lab ktoo

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
And two homosexuals

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
So funny hilarious that you were like before you listen to this

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Need to sit down we care about how you feel

6
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
When are boss at different times I feel like we talk about you I'm as I concerned parents sometime

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
I think Chad lately is he eating

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
It's soaked before we launched into the show today was going to introduce you to a couple of bucks and I'm Tobin

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
We are the co-hosts of a new show from WNYC Studios called Nancy

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,904
Why did you call Nancy is that code for something that someone's mom

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
It's whatever you want it to be

12
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,280
Stop it Nancy is like a real old-school term for a gay man

13
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
Thanks for the back in the day someone might be called a Nancy boy

14
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
I like such an answer

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Okay so Nancy as you can probably gather is a show about

16
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Very interested in LGBT stories

17
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
All the stuff that comes with it in the stories run the gamut he's a very quick preview one of the stories I'm working on which will be

18
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
Early in the season is a search for the first asian pornstar

19
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Until then says at one point he was talking to the director who claims to have discovered this guy she she LaRue

20
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,216
If you ever try to have a conversation about racism in p***

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
With a p*** director

22
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
Fascinating because really it just inspires them to pitch more movie

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,736
Black girl get black eyebrow Burial at guy income panda bear

24
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Don't you have the that just the

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Polar bear as the wife oh my God

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,328
You create created right now I'm just like my wheels are turning in my head

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
In one of the episodes you have this incredible conversation with your mom can you talk about that

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
So

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
I keep coming out to my mom

30
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
And then we

31
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Do the classic thing of

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
We don't talk about it anymore because it's uncomfortable for her so

33
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,808
I guess coming out to your mom to come yeah I keep bringing it up because I wanted to be a normal thing for us

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,440
This is how I feel why did you become this way

35
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Why did you choose this

36
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
I don't know

37
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Humane Society

38
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
Tulsa museums it because your family influenced you

39
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Why you whine you tell me why do you think this way

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Wisin y

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
It's not something you choose

42
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
You just are

43
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
I don't have the capability

44
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
A falling in love with men

45
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Do you know what that means

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Pasadena

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Compositi

48
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
It's not possible

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
For me to fall in love

50
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
With men

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
I don't know

52
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Desert

53
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
The world of gay Republicans which right now is rapidly changing under President Trump you hear a truly incredible

54
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,040
Conversation between hiv-positive man of different Generations

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
And the whole thing is driven by A really lovely curiosity that we must know everything there is to be about

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
We are because we are

57
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
You know how we are queer

58
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
But the reality is like

59
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
There's so much about other people that I don't know within the community and I think the show provides an opportunity to

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
To have this conversation

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
This is as much about you guys learning as it is about you guys

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
Nancy's first season is 12 episodes Atlanta April 9th

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Great

67
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Are you awake

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,663
Listening to Radiolab

69
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,783
Radio WNYC

70
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
At your name again is

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,255
February I'm going to write that down

72
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
So how can you hear me get high okay

73
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
I'm Robert Coolidge is Radio app

74
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
What is the story about a guy my name is Harold herring

75
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
I use the middle initial L for Lewis and honor of my father who asked a question

76
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
A simple question maybe a dangerous question just the beer asking

77
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
A vacuum at ruin the man's life never got answered but today on Radiolab we are going to re-ask Harold's question

78
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
This time

79
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
We get an answer

80
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,215
And let it Master takes it from here so our main guy Herald

81
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
He's former military and he's 81 years old

82
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Staying pretty active I'm competing at the national and World level or do a salon compass

83
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Location

84
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
Right off the bat this is the kind of guy you could tell he just does not give up

85
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
I've really I'm not supposed to be competing because I've had both knees replaced but anyway

86
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,119
When is Tiny Town Called Brown's Illinois from up where family is the eldest of 11 kids

87
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
Planes going up

88
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
He would always here

89
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Air Force planes flying overhead and that's why I from when he was very young he always wanted to be an

90
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Air Force pilot

91
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
So

92
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
How do you spell a little bit about your military background

93
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
Well most of my career was with the air rescue service

94
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,975
This is in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war if an Airforce pilot went down got shot down

95
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Whatever Carol Dennison would jump into their helicopters kudroli green heavy lift helicopters

96
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Hover over the survivors on the ground lowering the voice cable and their pararescuemen climb down

97
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
On the fourth floor find the injured Soldier and attached to cables

98
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Hold the helicopter steady you had to hold his hover and a lot of time

99
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
The enemy would wait until that process started before they open fire

100
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,447
I've had some wonderful experiences that probably Chief among them with my crew and I

101
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
We picked up a pilot ejected in the North Sea at night in the winter time

102
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
Hundred miles out to see if we picked him up and

103
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Brought him back

104
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Super high-risk high-adrenaline kind of job and I hadn't

105
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Outstanding record

106
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
And then well well he got

107
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Old how old were you around this time

108
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
Bye-bye by 39 old

109
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,495
Pilot to my age and with my experience were put into desk jobs

110
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
And

111
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Wanted to be on the front line if I could

112
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,943
This was 1973 middle of the Cold War

113
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
Harold decided that the way for him to be on the front lines without actually having to be on the front lines you know cuz

114
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Couldn't anymore

115
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,207
With to go into training to become a missileer

116
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Missile launch officer those are the people who sit in a underground bunker and

117
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,447
Just wait to get an order to turn the turkey

118
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
And unleash a nuclear attack in trading Hemmings just the information

119
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Remember just virtually Brooke verbatim

120
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Bears that eat

121
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Methodological offer

122
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Has under his Direct Control more Firepower than

123
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,975
Can all Generals in all wars in the history of warfare

124
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
And so

125
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
Started his training at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Nixon was president

126
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,247
At the time and at the time the prospect of nuclear war

127
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Felt very real

128
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
And a lot of responsibility there and there's no room for error

129
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Until in Harold's training we were very small class he learned all about the technical stuff you know all them

130
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
Mechanical stuff and emergency procedures that were involved all the nitty-gritty details of our missile actually

131
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,567
You want Shannon part of time we had classroom instruction where he learned about the chain of command and all the difference

132
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,175
Safeguards in check so I imagine that he gets an order to Launch

133
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
That order has to be decoded so he would decode the order and then his partner with the order and it would verify it with one another

134
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,183
One guy would be like okay I got the order alpha bravo 1 to 4

135
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
I confirm

136
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,095
Alpha bravo 1 to 4 and then they launched

137
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
So neither of them

138
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
Has the power to launch on his or her own and

139
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,847
Both of you are and do you carry a sidearm with you

140
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Why

141
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,455
Well you know it's serious business if you had someone that was

142
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
You know if if they threaten your life if one of the officers wanted to just go Rogue you had a sidearm

143
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
I took my gun and pointed against return the key Harlow I may go down but I

144
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,863
Be drawn my weapon at least keep have to be turned simultaneously so if I shoot you

145
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,751
Turn my key then Rover get your key and turn your key is too late right after you simultaneously

146
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,847
To the whole point is the system is designed so that no one person

147
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Can launch a nuclear attack

148
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
I was very pleased very satisfied with a checks and balances that the crew member levels the bottom worth

149
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,111
They're turning the keys I was not concerned about that at all

150
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
But then a few weeks into training there was a

151
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Some discussion about

152
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Preemptive strike

153
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,655
Real quick

154
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
Obviously if someone launched a nuclear attack against the us we would be able to strike back

155
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,431
Their pre-emptive strike would be where we for whatever reason

156
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Decided to strike

157
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
First

158
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
And that raise the hair on the back of my neck a little bit you know I just

159
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,863
I thought we're receiving all of this information about all these elaborate checks and balances

160
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
Within the system but they never got any information about how things worked at the presidential level

161
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
There's a complete void or blackout at the level that the order is in

162
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Initiated

163
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
When you had this thought that you say to the other classmates it wasn't my intent to try to create

164
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,767
Racine by involving other people students whatever so Harold weeks until the end of class

165
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
What's up with the front of the room and asks the instructor

166
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
A question the very reasonable question he's like just checking up there's a safety net in place at the present

167
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,823
Is making a crazy decision right I want her to find out more

168
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
About checks and balances at the

169
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
A top-level instructor pauses

170
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Looks at him

171
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Can you put that in writing please

172
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
Okay and so he did let me find it first

173
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,559
You do your best to have everything ready to go

174
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Oh here it is

175
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Okay

176
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,519
There is presently a degree of doubt my mind as to whether I might someday be called upon the lawn

177
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
Nuclear weapons as a result of an invalid unlawful order is it part of the letter that Harold wrote explaining his

178
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Question I ask myself

179
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
How Will I Know

180
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
Or can I be sure

181
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
I'm I am participating in a justifiable act if you were ordered to turn his keys

182
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
He would absolutely do so

183
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
But

184
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,375
Because you're not being told what the checks and balances are for the president

185
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
He would be doing so

186
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
With a conflict of conscience

187
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Picture of underline

188
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,383
I would be required to assign Blind Faith values to my judgment of one man

189
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
The present

190
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
Values which could ultimately include

191
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Hello

192
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Personality

193
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
And political considerations

194
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
This just should not be

195
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Okay there's a lot of

196
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
Sex on me but who is checking the president

197
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Kind of serious question

198
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Because right now we have a president President Trump

199
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Google

200
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Is clearly interested in nuclear weapons

201
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
He talks about it constantly you got the thing with North Korea escalating tensions of North Korea Syria for chrissakes

202
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Student makes you stop and think like

203
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
Okay if and when these decisions get made how are they made

204
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
Is there someone else in the room

205
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
If the president is determine if he if he's ready to go is there somebody there and turn to the president

206
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
That is a great question

207
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
This is historian Alex wellerstein he's the one who introduces Harold he wrote an article in the Washington Post

208
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,671
Post about this very topic am I at the right place I want to be just like a fists length away

209
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
Yeah yeah he has spent

210
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
So much time in the archives behind microfilm readers and foiling documents and doing all kinds

211
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Different things

212
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,751
To figure out the history of our relationship to this

213
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:41,151
Uniquely destructive weapon and what he found was a kind of tug of war

214
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
Between the military and the president

215
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
That is gone.

216
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
More than 70 years

217
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
Good morning by President Roosevelt's death

218
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Harry S Truman becomes president

219
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
Woman learned how to bomb the day that Roosevelt died

220
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
This is April 1945 at this point America has been at war with Japan for over 3 years

221
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
It was impressed upon Truman that this was

222
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Not just another weapon that this was something that could be bigger and better than any other weapon before

223
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
But there's no

224
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Point with somebody says

225
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
Hey mr. president sure we bomb Japan with this bump

226
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Assumed

227
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Of course you're going to do it you have the bomb

228
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
You have the enemy and in fact nobody ever goes to Truman and says should we do this they go

229
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
Go to Hammond they say we are doing this

230
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
The Truman write in his journal

231
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
We're going to use the atomic bomb but we will not use it on a civilian Target we will use it on a purely military Target

232
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
That's the term

233
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Shirley

234
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Shirley

235
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
That we can't get into his head to know exactly what I was thinking but that is what he wrote in his journal at the time and then he says we will not be

236
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Killing women and chill

237
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
The first atomic bomb

238
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
Is going to be dropped by a President

239
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Thinks he's dropping it on soldiers only he's

240
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Someone congratulating himself on the no women and children will be killed in this attack

241
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
Atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima

242
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Men's announcement after they dropped the bomb the day after they get casualty estimates from the Japanese and he realizes

243
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
This is not purely a military base

244
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
Approximately the size of Memphis or Seattle or Rochester New York no longer exist

245
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,815
The total death toll was almost 200 thousand

246
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
So there's a real switch that happens between Truman talking about the bomb and also everything he says about the bomb before he hears with a k

247
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Casualties on both the greatest thing ever and this is the greatest day in history and he's so proud and so happy and then here's

248
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,711
About the casualties in tears about the women and children and suddenly it becomes a burden

249
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Now what happen

250
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,343
Japan August 10th he gets a message from General Groves

251
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,439
Just three days after Hiroshima dropped two bombs

252
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
Alberta have a third one in a week

253
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Just FYI

254
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
And it's not clear

255
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,399
The Truman new the two bombs are going to be drop so soon

256
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
He is

257
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Just learn the Hiroshima is a city

258
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
When he just wanted another city

259
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
He is not in control

260
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
And he has immediately written back

261
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
To that massage

262
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Stop knock it off

263
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,807
You are not going to drop another bomb without express permission of the president of the United States

264
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,903
Soak the major theme of Truman's approach to nuclear weapons

265
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
If they keep them out of the hands of the millet

266
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Why he believes that the military if you give them a new weapon they will use it

267
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
It's not a crazy idea to design and build these bombs to make sure the military can't launch them on

268
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
The nuclear parts of the bomb have to be in the possession of the civilians the Nuclear So the

269
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
The plutonium the plutonium core nearly bombs allowed to do that the fronts of them actually open up and allow you to stick

270
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Krikorian and close it back up so the civilians walk into the room with the explosive part the soldiers open

271
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Lid

272
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
The civilians put the explosive part in close the door now you have an active Bomb by putting a battery or something else

273
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:21,055
Biking to your Walkman why do I have that analogy in my eighty-year-old where does it put the nuclear

274
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
They have their own faults with their own guys but their own gums and their job is to shoot anybody who

275
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Tries to take

276
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,623
A core without presidential authorization for the rest of his presidential term Truman doesn't

277
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
Budge the nuclear power is his

278
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
And he's alone but the technology starts to make it trickier to do this

279
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,167
If you want a very small atomic bomb you can't

280
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
Separate the pin out from that is just not going to happen it's physically like glued to the explosives and things like that

281
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
So it's 1953 just a few years before held enter the military

282
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
Returns to Fort Benning Georgia

283
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
President Eisenhower comes to power and he's a former General right exactly is a little bit less concerned about

284
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
Who has control over these nuclear weapons so he

285
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,559
Eases up a little bit in his administration

286
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
I'm Potomac weapons small ones are to be treated as basically any other kind of weapon

287
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Awesome this is archival footage from 1960 when President Eisenhower is getting a first look at some of the newest addition to the new

288
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Nuclear Arsenal

289
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
Binoculars to watch helicopters

290
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,063
At that time they were really creative with their new nuclear weapon

291
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Does he

292
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
Continue to maintain authority over the bigger bombs he allows them to be transferred to the military but he said

293
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,447
Says Don't drop them without my permission but there are some cases in which she says

294
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Under really bad circumstances you can use some of these weapons without my permission compared to Truman he's really shifting that

295
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
PowerBack

296
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Does the military

297
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
Yes but by the time Kennedy is the president

298
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,415
Harold has 24 his Pilot in the Air Force

299
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
Are the two in the most danger of Devastation Soviet capabilities are greatly increased so

300
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Can you get rid of anxiety

301
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,615
Some of these anxieties bubble-up and popular these are these are kind of out there

302
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:38,015
How to drop the bomb on popular culture is

303
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
In nuclear fear

304
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Mueller building bomb shelters kids in classrooms are practicing hiding under their desks

305
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
This distance the Heatwave is sufficient to cause melting the upturned eyeball

306
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
You have bombers flying from the United States and on these routes to take them near the so

307
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Soviet borders

308
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
And the problem is you put up a lot of bombers only a matter of time before they'll expect one.

309
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
Cracker of a malfunction

310
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
B-52 carrying hydrogen Munitions and so indeed there are a bunch of accidents

311
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,144
Bombers crash with hydrogen bombs on board a crashed in Spain and drop hydrogen bombs

312
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,472
One of us gets dropped in Greenland

313
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,872
Play crash in the United States numerous times there's one in the South for a bomb basically land on somebody's house in the comic book

314
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,736
Atomic atomic bomb landed on someone's house

315
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
B-47 jet Over Florence South Carolina

316
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
Thomas tomorrow

317
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
On the water

318
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
That would be the most terrifying thing imagine you're just brushing your teeth and then

319
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
And there's a knock on the door is excuse me we going to remove this

320
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,080
So does all these accidents and on top of that America is keeping a bunch of its bombs and bases all over the world

321
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
And I start to worry that some of these bases are are not American bases and there aren't that many Americans on them

322
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
Nukes are kept at a base in Turkey turkey's our friend not a problem but they're like

323
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,976
Two American guys guarding these things they have the keys to turn these missiles on

324
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,120
What do you need to do if Turkey wants to become a nuclear power over the head with a hammer and take the keys

325
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,520
Now turkey is a nuclear power yeah this is more or less what Kennedy says

326
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
Waxing Instinct The Truman that he issues a directive which says no weapons can be kept overseas unless they have

327
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Have locks on them

328
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
In the first versions of these are very crude they're like literally combination locks we like bikes yeah they're pretty simple

329
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
So you're you're doing this technological enabling of this kind of

330
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:58,560
Vast political metaphor that the president is in control of these nuclear weapons at all times

331
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Truman wanted it

332
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Close

333
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
To the chest

334
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,336
And then Eisenhower wanted it out there and then Kennedy now is pulling it back in right exactly

335
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
At the time this felt safe

336
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
Who better to trust in the

337
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
President with something so powerful to get in the world

338
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,904
And even after Kennedy the laws around this solidify the power stays

339
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
With the president yes

340
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
But then

341
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
You got this guy

342
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,888
People have got to know whether or not their President Richard milhous Nixon

343
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
And this feeling of safety and really

344
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
All trust in the presidency

345
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Starts to a road

346
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
So in the last days of his presidency the Watergate break-in they're all the investigations

347
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,064
Nixon was drinking more than the president perhaps ought to

348
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
He was under intense amount of

349
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Stress

350
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
He did a few things that made people uncomfortable the most infamous Moment Like This happened in the summer

351
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
1974

352
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,192
Yes when all the Watergate stuff was really coming to a hat p was talking with two congressmen

353
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
And he was trying to impress upon them what a waste of time this quote little burglary was and

354
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Give an example of

355
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
A minor this was he explain that

356
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
His responsibilities were huge if he wanted to he could go into the other room pick up a telephone in 20 minutes

357
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
60 million people would be dead

358
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
Wow he said that he said this

359
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:34,048
And that's exactly the kind of situation Harold was thinking about when he asked his question like

360
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,144
Since I'm the guy with my hand on the he just kind of curious here

361
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
Is there a system for making sure a president doesn't just walk into the other room pick up the phone and order me to kill six

362
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
A million people

363
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
There is presently a degree of doubt in my mind

364
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
So he asks this question first

365
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
Out loud then he does it in writing and then I was pulled out of training unequal survival

366
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,536
6 days before graduation that leads to a series of meetings with Superior officers

367
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Tell him that I need to have more faith in our leaders know not to question him

368
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:17,312
And I was told I didn't have a need to know that leads to a trial

369
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
Where he has this one meeting with this military judge you basically here I have your question in my hand I will tear it up

370
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:30,112
And we will can all forget this ever happened but I still wanted to question answered and then that leads to appeal

371
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
And he's writing letters I would spend days and nights virtually continuously writing to congressman

372
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:42,912
Writing and writing to the president but it really didn't matter at all what I had to say

373
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
He's basically like okay fine I I don't

374
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
Want to be a launch officer anymore I asked to be you no real sign if they weren't going to give the info

375
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,200
Cremation but instead of reassigning him my

376
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
Promote Lieutenant Colonel with withheld

377
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,624
I was removed from flight status so I no longer would get flight pay

378
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:08,000
I was thin permanently disqualified from the human reliability program

379
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,560
Along with that my

380
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Top secret security

381
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Clarence was taken away from me

382
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
And once you have a security clearance remove and your permanent disqualify there's no hope

383
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
For your career

384
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,712
I pursued every Avenue available to me

385
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
To have my military record corrected

386
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,136
And to have the findings reversed

387
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
And to Romanian Air Force

388
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
Only after I exhausted

389
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
All of my Appeals

390
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Was I ordered

391
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
Kirby

392
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
Retired

393
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
What

394
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
I don't why why a man knows it like the whole military thing you got to stay in your lane you don't question your spear

395
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Why would they

396
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
What's the question why why would they why what's wrong with him asking the question why is it such a

397
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Well I'll tell you right after we take a break

398
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,536
This is Timothy franczyk calling from Stillwater Minnesota Radiolab is supported in part by the

403
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,016
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

404
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,136
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

405
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
And I request

406
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,816
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

407
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:53,216
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times

408
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
So did something

409
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

410
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,224
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

411
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

412
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:16,000
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

413
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

414
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
Don't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

415
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

416
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,872
Record a short audio message for us

417
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,480
Again that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

418
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
Hey I'm Jared I'm wrought iron Robert krulwich Radiolab until lots of why was Harold question such a threat

419
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
Here's how it was put to me. The other side has to know the only reason the only way that a phrase with this

420
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
The whole the whole premise is deterrence not has been our founding philosophy

421
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
Since we develop these things this is dr. Sonya McMullen and I'm a former Air Force missileer

422
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
She had her hand on the nuclear keys from 1997 to 2001

423
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
She means Arizona

424
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Countries from nuking us

425
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,408
Will Newcomb

426
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Right back

427
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,856
But if the other side doesn't believe that you will respond in kind

428
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Then it doesn't work you have to believe my thread is legit I have to be credible so if you're the guy who's hand is on

429
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
Kaneki when the order comes down to launch there can't be any doubt that you will do what you were ordered to do exactly

430
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
So the problem with somebody like Carol is it you're in if you start allowing people to at the bottom to start making up their mind

431
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,200
Then it's not a credible threat cuz I want to understand in your own mind why they had to have a

432
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,040
Committee to sit in judgment on him and review

433
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Some sort of

434
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Factory I don't know what

435
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,184
I'm I'm in Plano I haven't seen their side of it I'm

436
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Filing

437
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
To get access to that side we'll see how that goes

438
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
So I found this actually just we got this morning so we actually ended up finding a statement by the

439
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
Commander in Chief of Strategic Air Command

440
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
At General Russ Doherty

441
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
I don't know if you have

442
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,224
CNET Harold but it's going to be fair we thought we should let Harold respond to what do you know about

443
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
No but he would see us

444
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:53,440
Think that Commander cheapest teaching her come in right right right until let me just read to you what he said sure

445
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:59,584
Demetrius hesitation initiated extensive hearings and administrative procedures

446
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,960
Later he professed that he really would turn keys and that is hesitation and be misunderstood

447
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,800
Examine the record thoroughly and discovered that for a fact

448
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
Kid repeated several times in the record that he would readily turn keys

449
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,040
Each instance is affirmative assertion was followed immediately by a personal

450
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
Subjective qualification

451
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,696
Yes he would turn Keys upon receipt of an authentic order from proper Authority

452
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,000
If he thought the order was legal

453
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,096
If he thought the circumstances necessitated an ICBM launch

454
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,936
If he was convinced that it was irrational moral necessity and so on

455
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,336
Every affirmative answer was qualified by a subjective condition

456
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,896
I did not say that anywhere

457
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Nowhere did I say that

458
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
Nowhere did I use those words

459
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
And

460
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
I'm sorry but

461
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
That's just

462
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Dutchess Falls

463
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,792
That doesn't surprise me according to Harold he never wanted to doubt an order coming from the president

464
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Moon

465
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Let there had to be

466
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Some

467
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Sort of check and balance

468
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
So that one man

469
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Couldn't just

470
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
On a whim

471
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
Order the launch of nuclear weapons just wanted to be told that something like that existed so that

472
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
He and his fellow officers

473
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:26,112
Would not have to have a conflict of conscience and that we not put anybody in a position

474
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Horror

475
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
They're just following orders

476
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,816
I'm throwing our conscious to the for when I think it's an affront

477
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,168
To play the game of you don't have the need to know

478
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,264
Someone that's doing one of the most serious

479
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,848
Grave jobs that there is

480
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Any armed forces

481
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Ento

482
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,016
Harold never got an answer to his question

483
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
We decided to make it

484
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,464
Our question where where do you get somebody who's allowed to question the president because we know

485
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
I know that my time you get to the bottom there's no way that's possible so what about the guy above that let's say there's an officer who's one more up to

486
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,264
Is he going to question me order well I don't know he's getting it from the general to coordinate all of the nuclear attacks but if it

487
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,664
I got the ham it must be a legitimate order right maybe those top-level major heads of the military branches

488
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,064
Maybe they get to I don't know and so my question is where if anywhere if the president issues an order

489
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
Tammy will they say no

490
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:39,072
After a lot of digging around Alex says that he thinks my guess is you're not allowed to question the president

491
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
More than a couple steps down from the very top if you're allowed to question the present at all maybe we can do it and when we talk

492
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
To Sonya McMullen

493
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
Element lyrics

494
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,360
She also thought that the Secretary of Defense could

495
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
Probably provide a check

496
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,736
The Secretary of defense's that is the first person to say

497
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Hey let's let's think about this

498
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
I think about this in detail

499
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
All right

500
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
We're ready

501
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Okay

502
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
This is Bill Perry

503
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,304
Formally Secretary of Defense 1960 defense of the United States

504
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,888
So we decided to ask an actual Secretary of Defense

505
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,704
William Perry served under President Clinton

506
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
Up from 1994 to 1997

507
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,408
Yeah let's just pretend for a moment that the president issues you an order that you disagree with

508
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
Because you don't think the president is of right mind or

509
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Sober

510
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Or whatever

511
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
What Authority do you have a secretary of defense avanee

512
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
The system is set up

513
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
So that only the president has the authority to order a nuclear war

514
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Nobody has the right

515
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
The countermand that decision

516
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
Team I choose

517
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,728
To call the secretary defense or the Secretary of State

518
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
Or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

519
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
To get his advice was counseled

520
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,200
But he even if it does that you may or may not accept that counsel

521
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,296
If you as Secretary of Defense say to the president he says let's

522
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Go and you say let's not

523
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
Can you vote if he calls me and then if I say that mr. president that would be a very serious mistake don't do

524
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,072
Do that he might or might not accept my advice

525
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,656
Are you necessary to launch like

526
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Suppose

527
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,056
Everybody in the room thought that it was a bad idea would he still be able to do it yes

528
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,200
He has the exact call directly to the Strategic Air Command to do the launching

529
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
End

530
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,344
They will respond to his orders they don't call the sexual defense

531
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
For the children's sake should I do this

532
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
They do it

533
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
Yeah so in our training we are conditioned

534
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Almost like

535
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,216
Pavlovian tok this is Doctor Bruce Blair he was a missile launch officer

536
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
At the exact time that Harold was training to become one and ever since then he basically spent the whole rest of his career

537
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,712
We are studying nuclear command-and-control and I wrote studies

538
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:09,088
So classified that the Pentagon demanded that I not be allowed to read them anymore

539
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
We asked him like why does it work like this why would we give one person that much power it's always

540
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,120
It's always been set up that way and it came out of the

541
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
Cold War

542
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
You know in the 1960s

543
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
I don't know what

544
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,616
By the 1960s the US and the Soviet Union were building icbm's which of these nuclear missiles they could

545
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
Go from a silo in one country

546
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
To Target in the other in the matter of minutes

547
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:42,112
So if the Soviets ever launched their missiles at us for under a missile attack

548
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
There's very little time to assess the attack

549
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
To brief the president on his

550
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Options

551
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:53,632
Because the Assumption was that the Soviets would Target our missiles are icbms

552
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,216
And they would be the first to go into the office for the president

553
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
Has to decide whether to launch ICBM

554
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
Before the other metros land for

555
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Any incoming missiles could destroy

556
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
Command and control system

557
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
In

558
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
That horses

559
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,368
The present to make a decision on how to respond immediately because missiles are flying in it

560
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
4 miles per second is about 6 or 7 minutes

561
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
To make that decision

562
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
Sex with a decision process

563
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Is too short

564
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
For any kind of

565
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
Thoughtful or serious deliberation and the pressure is intense

566
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
And there I think you

567
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Would find that

568
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Different presidents would respond differently

569
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,640
And their character their temperament

570
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
Are they thinking people

571
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,248
Where are they intuitive people

572
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
Coopers Pond instinctively in ISO

573
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
See a lot of variation in the way

574
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Presidents

575
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
React to a nuclear emergency

576
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
If the president United States now for

577
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,656
50 years is followed at all times twenty-four hours a day by a military aid

578
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:04,288
Current football this is Van Vice President Dick Cheney also up former Secretary of Defense

579
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
Talking on Fox News Sunday back in 2008

580
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
He could watch the kind of a devastating attack the world's member saying he doesn't have to check with anybody he doesn't have to go

581
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,136
Call the Congress he doesn't have to check with the court he has that Authority because of the nature of the world we live in

582
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
It bothers me

583
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,656
Immensely that the only area that there is not a checking balance

584
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
Is a 1

585
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,752
Zack and literally result in the end of the world

586
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
They seem strange to me

587
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
Have you thought about this at all and wondered whether there's a better way to do this yes I have and what would you suggest

588
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
I have a

589
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,392
Specifically proposing to continue to propose unsuccessfully again former secretary defense William Perry

590
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,512
Louis phase-out are icbms and to the extent we have to have a nuclear deterrence

591
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
We limited the submarines in airplanes because

592
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
They don't have to lunch

593
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,216
In 5 minutes or 6 minutes for 7 minutes and when it comes to preemptive strikes

594
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,568
He says how we have before the Congress now a bill making a modification

595
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
Which has the less

596
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Ellesse United States

597
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
Has been verifiably attacked

598
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
Then the president

599
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Hash before you

600
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Yvonne Chisholm nuclear weapons

601
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
Has to go to Congress

602
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Full commission

603
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,024
So far our bill is very simple this is congressman Ted lieu and he and Senator Ed Markey are the guys who off

604
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
After the Bell Jessie says

605
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,472
Before the president can launch a nuclear first strike the president must first get a declaration of war from Congress

606
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
I believe that you introduced this

607
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Bill

608
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Before the elect

609
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Sarah Wright

610
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Absolutely

611
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
Senator Mark I believe we need a structural fix We Believe actually Hillary Clinton was going to be president

612
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Is Bill

613
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
I would have replied to her

614
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
And that's because

615
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,512
The fate of humanity in our world should not rest on one person

616
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
And so are you seeing this as just as you sizing the stop is this a systemic problem or is this a

617
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
Problem with one person who

618
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
Just happened to have the office right now it's actually a systemic problem

619
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,896
And it's also a problem with the current person in the office

620
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Who's the president

621
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,760
But you can see future President right could be elected with

622
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,576
Judgment or temperament issues or maybe

623
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,160
They simply go to Advanced age and get

624
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
Alzheimer's right or or some other

625
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
I sort of issue

626
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
That's why we can't

627
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Have a system queer

628
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,960
There's so little checks and balances do you know about this bill or

629
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Have you heard from now actually down

630
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
That's that's interesting

631
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
That is a very interesting bill

632
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
.

633
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Let me let me say this way

634
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,112
On one hand I agree

635
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,488
Because of God I always like to have checks and balances

636
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
On the other hand

637
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
I also think that it

638
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,704
It it says to a potential adversary

639
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
Enid

640
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
Now there's doubt

641
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
So there to sort of values here

642
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
1 is

643
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,784
Your Humane interest in making sure that

644
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
The end of the world if it comes to that

645
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,416
Is happening for good reason

646
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,000
LOL just reason it's best you can define it

647
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
And

648
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
The ongoing hope that by making this

649
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Art system

650
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
Credible that they will never have end of the world

651
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,312
So my question to you is like how do you weigh those together

652
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Well

653
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
It's

654
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
That's the Dilemma

655
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Yeah

656
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
You know that's the Dilemma

657
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,919
So after the military force Harold to retire

658
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
He became a truck driver

659
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,551
And once I got that job I made up my mind

660
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
But I was going to devote my time

661
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,671
I'm making a living for my family into that company

662
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,535
Then I wasn't going to be off dealing with this subject anymore

663
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
Eventually he started doing Addiction Counseling at the Salvation Army mostly with homeless

664
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
How how what's your sort of

665
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,383
Emotional state around all this right now like how often is this something you still think about it how

666
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
What do you how do you feel right now

667
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Hell I'm

668
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
I'm just

669
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
I just I think that

670
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,671
Common sense I think

671
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
The

672
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
Goodness in human beings

673
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
Babes

674
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
4

675
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
A resolution dance

676
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
I just think it's nothing need

677
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
For that

678
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Is

679
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,823
At least as great now as it

680
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
Ever been in the history of our Republic

681
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
And I might add on a personal level that

682
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
When I was really

683
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
Committed

684
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
To the military to the Air Force

685
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,207
Volunteered several times in 02

686
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,559
To do my duty with respect the Vietnam War and

687
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
I just felt

688
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,167
That I had asked a very reasonable question

689
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
That deserved

690
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
An answer and

691
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
And it was not

692
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
For me alone

693
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639

To place early in the morning of March 1st 1954 search been a while

719
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,207
Tell a couple weeks back the writers Sam Keen put us in touch with this guy

720
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,559
But was quite traumatic and then hard to forget

721
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
How old are you on that day

722
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,679
In 1954 I was 9 years old 9 years old

723
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,055
His name is Tony De Brum he is an ambassador for the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific

724
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,383
He tells a story about a particular moment that happened

725
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
When he was nine

726
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,711
One a day very early in the morning

727
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,831
At that moment is that the early one morning hours I was out fishing with my grandfather

728
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,719
It was customary we lived in

729
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,791
Two to go net fishing

730
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
Throw net fishing for scad

731
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,679
Tony says he and his grandpa were out on the beach

732
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
Before the sun has risen

733
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
And they waited through the water tossing their net

734
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Pulling a back

735
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,127
Tough it out

736
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Pulling it back

737
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,551
Natalie done that for a while the settlers took beginning to rise from the East

738
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,623
And I was carrying the basket he was throwing the net

739
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,439
Turn the flashlight off

740
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
We are temporarily blinded by the Flash

741
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
It was as if someone had walked up to you with a with a flash camera and and

742
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,823
Nnn took a shot writing inches from your eyes

743
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
I cannot

744
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,015
With any certainty tell you how many seconds past

745
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,183
But

746
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
I felt the shock it was like the real

747
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,983
Heavy burst of wind going through real and it turned away from the light and back

748
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,383
Towards the shore where you can see the the vegetation moved

749
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,759
It's Indescribable I thought it was the end of the world

750
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
But Tony didn't know is it 300 miles away the US had just test

751
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Did a bomb they called Castle Bravo it was a hydrogen bomb but a thousand times

752
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,983
Strong as the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima and then the

753
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,383
The rumble and Roar and the Thunder of the the sound of the explosion

754
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
This was not one big explosion that goes just boom and that's it the Chain Reaction caused it to

755
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,183
222 roll like thunder and then

756
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:31,583
He says the sky erupted everything turn red the sky 2

757
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,983
Turn red ocean was red the sand was red my grandfather was threatened

758
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,383
Fish report for rent so holds that the whole atmosphere the whole hemisphere

759
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,783
The effect was like you're standing under a glass bowl and somebody put blood over

760
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,183
We we were terrified

761
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,167
That explosion in the many others like it

762
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,239
Would poison the Marshall Islands poisonous people

763
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
But in that moment Tony says

764
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
His grandpa just stood there

765
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
Listening to the explosions

766
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,551
And staring at the Blood Red Sky it seemed to have lasted for what

767
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
What seemed like hours I am Nas

768
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
72 years old and every time I speak about this my My Skin So cross night

769
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,751
I still get goosebumps
