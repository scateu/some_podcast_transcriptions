1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm Robert krulwich Emily Webster this is Radiolab and today today we've got a guy asking

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,952
A pretty common question yeah but the way he tries to solve this question is it first

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,280
Thrilled

6
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,096
Instructor-led puzzle

7
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,400
It comes to us from producer Andy Mills

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
Story is about David Weinberg

9
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
A buddy of mine and it starts off right around the time you get that high school yeah I graduated from high school and tooth

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
Mm and then

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,944
Went directly to University and then

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
I got kicked out

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Somewhere the beginning of the second semester

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,160
And then left that town that I was living in a move to the town where all my friends were going to college and

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
He moves into the group house it was a party house and a bunch of his friends there was a giant

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,448
Cross in the front yard and my friends had found while tripping on acid and put in a shopping cart and they put in the front yard

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Are fact-checker actually found out they were tripping on mushrooms not acid but anyway a lot of drinking a lot of partying

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
David is like for a while it was

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,992
Goodbye I'm hanging out with like the people that I care about most in the world I feel

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,624
Incredibly free because I don't live at home anymore and then I

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
There it just started to get old for 1

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
Every day when his friends would go off to class

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,864
David would have to go to work during the day I was working as a janitor at the University where my friends went

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
And during the evenings I would deliver pizzas

25
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
Put on like this for years

26
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
You know day after day they would party but then in the morning when his friends would go to class he would go and clean

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Toilets and then deliver pizzas

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
I'll do sophomore year they would go to class he would clean toilets

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Andover Pizza

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Junior year class

31
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Toilets

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,464
Pizzas and like I think looking back on it now I think

33
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,536
There was this rage that started to build up inside

34
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Inside me because

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,936
I mean I was really sick of cleaning the toilets of kids in the dorms who

36
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,032
I resent but are also but I also recognize are able to do something that I

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,920
Wasn't able to do and you know all my friends were at that University and they were about to graduate and

38
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
So I think I was also worried that like

39
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
Well they're all going to go off and live these lies and I'm going to be stuck here cleaning toilets in the top of that by the time

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Most of David's friends for seniors

41
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,024
He was spending his weekends in jail for driving on a suspended license

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
To my life at that point was like

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,192
Cleaning toilets in the morning delivering pizzas in the evening and then every weekend I was in jail

44
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
And

45
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
It was kind of this

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Breaking Point

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,968
One thing one thing we did a lot of like we listen to all the punk music my friends were in punk bands

48
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
And we would just like to get really drunk and like yell into the speakers

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
I like three or four nights a week in up

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,024
And one night we were doing that it was me and my friend Danny and my friend Mark and something just snapped inside me

51
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
I got lost it

52
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,656
Just started like grabbing chairs and hurling them for Windows and just like

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
Smashed out all the windows in our house

54
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
You couldn't see the floor cuz there was just like wreckage everywhere and I was all bloody

55
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
And I was just like

56
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Present tense it was

57
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
I don't think it hit me until the next morning

58
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
When I saw what it look like

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Like a hurricane a black rip through the house

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Yeah and all his friends

61
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
IPhone just went to stun their sort of like

62
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
What's going on

63
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
And then you know when you when you confront

64
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
A reality like that

65
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
Everything just sort of gets Stripped Away and you're just left with this question that's like

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Who am I

67
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
And what am I doing with my life

68
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
Around that time

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
David was driving around delivering pizzas

70
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
Listen to the radio and WBEZ Chicago This American Life

71
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
Ameriglass heard the story

72
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
Vistacare story couple test

73
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
I was hired to interview men and women in the state of Utah who receive Medicaid support for treatment of men

74
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Mental illnesses

75
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Generally

76
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
And it just like

77
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
Stop me in my tracks I saw the stories by a guy named Scott

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
Carrier the frequent contributor of This American Life in

79
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,175
It's basically about how he gets his new job he gets this job

80
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
Driving around the state of Utah interviewing schizophrenic people

81
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Giving them this test

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
I took the job because I had no other

83
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,207
I took the job because I just quit my steady job my profession

84
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,047
And this is happening at a point where Scott's life is falling apart

85
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
What I wanted more than anything was to put my boss on the floor

86
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Stand on his throat

87
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,519
Watching guy talks about how he hates his boss and my wife moved out

88
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,663
Took the kids and everything's wife had just left him so I took the job and did the job

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,759
And my life will never be the same

90
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
And David says

91
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
As soon as he heard that story I remember thinking like

92
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,975
I need to figure out how to become a radio producer that's what I need to do

93
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,559
Why why does he

94
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Well

95
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
I think first off

96
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Scott carrier is

97
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,239
Really good at what he does is something about him that is magnetic

98
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Right it gets people thinking I want to do that

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
But maybe more importantly

100
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
In the story

101
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Scott is

102
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Stuck

103
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Not too dissimilar from

104
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Where David finds himself and

105
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,623
Scott does he turns his stuckness into a story

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
And in doing so kind of

107
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Gives it meaning

108
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
It's getting its Rising above your situation sort of

109
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
David hears everything's like

110
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,447
Maybe I can do that to make sense yeah it was like okay

111
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
This is my

112
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Ticket

113
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,711
Soap that summer he lined up a job at this camp this summer camp in Upstate New York

114
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
And I bought this minidisc recorder shirt

115
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,791
10th he and his buddy Mark who had just graduated

116
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,911
They left Colorado and headed to Upstate New York my idea was like okay I'll just go around and

117
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
Kelly's recordings and then I'll write these stories about what it all means and

118
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
They want

119
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Sole on the road but with

120
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Recordings

121
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
He recorded the kids at the camp this bar fight one night when he was out

122
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Can a counselors

123
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
What good animes are keyboard

124
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Listen for this is the coolest thing in the world

125
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
Put these on

126
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Is that cool

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
It's a live recording what's happening right now and yes I distinctly remember just being in

128
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
Delete all of hearing recordings that I had made

129
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
When nothing is happening

130
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
The idea that I can make a recording and listen to it

131
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
It was like

132
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Like early man

133
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
She's a mirror you know and just can't stop staring at it

134
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Yeah

135
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Yeah he wasn't it

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
Interviewing

137
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
People are anything like that he'd sort of decided

138
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
That he wanted to record moments

139
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
As they happen

140
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Any figured

141
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
The best way to do that was to record

142
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Secretly

143
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,759
I had cut a small hole in all of the pants and shorts that had in the pocket

144
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
So I could get up in the morning

145
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Put the

146
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
Minidisc recorder in my pocket and then I'd run the cord down my shirt

147
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
And anytime

148
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Something interesting was happening I would slip my

149
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
Figure my pocket in just press record with at first just some moments here and there

150
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
Possible little scenes for a story Maybe

151
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Abraham

152
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Then

153
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
He and his buddy Mark to go to New York City

154
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Everything

155
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
So he's reporting more and more upper little dude

156
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
40 day

157
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
After New York he and mark hitchhiked across Europe together

158
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
Karen David

159
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
At this point David is recording people that pick him up

160
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
He and Mark and their other buddy down on the side of the road on the highway is

161
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Even it sounds almost like waves on the ocean

162
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Run up to

163
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
Stand next to and record

164
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Just

165
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Everything

166
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
And you're still thinking to yourself like

167
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Man I'm just getting gold

168
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Yeah I was like yeah this is love this is the raw material for my first great story you know and I think I tried

169
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Separated myself from

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
It's like it's kind of cliche like a new backpack around Europe and it's like one of those people like

171
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Actually making a

172
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
Grands documentary like I'm a

173
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Imma imma somebody you know I'm not just like everybody else

174
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Yeah

175
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Meanwhile David is accumulating hundreds and hundreds of hours of tape and one thing that you'll hear a few minutes to live

176
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Through all of it

177
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
Or most of it as I did it's just him hanging out with his buddy Mark like we became

178
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Instant

179
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Friends the moment we met

180
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,503
Marco's year older than David he was really into music

181
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
Sound Engineering that's Mark scene

182
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,047
We have this like perfect Dynamic where Mark had like enough Talent like you could actually play music

183
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
And like a Christie's funny songs on the spot

184
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,775

And the two of them together the Wii

186
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Would just end up in these crazy places

187
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,719
Oh yeah I remember this recording yeah I remember that

188
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
We were in Croatia

189
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
Then we ended up with this huge amazing party was like in this old abandoned cabins building which is

190
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Beautiful Croatian people

191
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Cuz it's a great day

192
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
But then

193
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
French fries veggies or applesauce Mark came back to the States Mark when I was able to record an album with his band

194
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,727
And and David I got a job waiting tables at Applebee's

195
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Dinner salad or soup

196
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Before the meal

197
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
Magnus Hometown living in his parents basement

198
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
And if you guys are taking

199
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Taking money out of your pocket

200
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
You're taking money out your pocket

201
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
You're taking money out of my

202
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,647
This kid that hung out with the most that I work with was this meth addict I would go to a place after

203
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Working like

204
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
Drink beer and play video games and he would get high and it was like really depressing

205
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Hard time

206
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
Shity

207
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
And David has all of this tape

208
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Tons and tons

209
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
And tons of tape

210
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
From X with Mark in New York in

211
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Europe

212
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
But he has

213
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
No idea what to do with it

214
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
So you just keep hitting record

215
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Yes

216
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
All right

217
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Yeah I mean I just I just needed that more I think I needed the recording in a wire more than any time in my life been with it

218
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
But that was a true but I needed the why the most

219
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
This sucks

220
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
Like I'm going to I'm going to get through this I'm going to end this will be a chapter in the story

221
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
It's been a lot of my time with my finger

222
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,591
Gently resting on the mini disc player I could feel the disc spinning

223
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
When it was recording

224
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
It was just very satisfying comforting

225
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
You know like a pulse

226
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Anyway yeah yeah

227
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
Still going yeah

228
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
No we should get one of those bells

229
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
Some bartenders

230
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,175
Does he have a story I'm not so sure he's cut when I tell well

231
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
Hang on to the break

232
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
I think you'll think you'll hear an answer

233
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
This is Neva Bartram from Encinitas California

234
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543

240
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

241

We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

242
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,359
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

243
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

244
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

245
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,743
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

246
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

247
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
Epic moments where kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

248
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
If you have a story please share it with us

Thank you so much

252
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
I'm rubber, which I Molly Webster and we're back

253
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
And today we're out we're in the middle of a story

254
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,407
But David Weinberg who is recording almost every day of his life and last we left him

255
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
He was in Applebee's

256
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Working as a waiter and living in his parents basement

257
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,415
Right but he did eventually save up enough money to travel again I went to Alaska things like that

258
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
And he says that

259
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
Win 10

260
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,839
Bad like at Applebee's you needed these recordings to make his life feel like it had

261
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
Meaning when times were good

262
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
He couldn't stop recording because he was worried that he was going to miss some

263
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah occasionally like something would go wrong like I lost

264
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:49,407
Three or four recorders they broke down over the course of the years has recording

265
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
And whenever our quarter broke that would be a. Where I have to wait for the new recorder to come and I just

266
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Felt like

267
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
On edge all the time you know like I need to be a missing I'm missing out you don't like in this weird Twisted way like I feel like I was Miss

268
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Missing out on life

269
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Because I wasn't recording it so when you would get the recorder it would be like a relief oh yeah I was like thank God I can you know

270
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
Is pressure would be releasing I can go back to recording

271
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
And I would just feel like myself again you know

272
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
But then

273
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:25,247
Hey guys ride ahead of you or behind David ended up down in Seattle where he met back up with Mark

274
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
And

275
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
Mark and I got in some big arguments in Seattle before I left

276
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,535
What is a woman

277
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
He just told me when I depart

278
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Hate the fact that you record me all the time

279
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
And

280
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
It always recording

281
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Text conversation to

282
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
I don't know why and he just laid it all out for me

283
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
You know like he was someone who spent

284
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
His day all day in a recording studio meticulously laying down perfect tracks you know that

285
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
That was his life

286
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,231
And so to him that idea that you would just sort of like record everything it was wrong for a lot of reasons

287
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,071
One of which was he just didn't think that the experience is worn to that

288
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,983
And then he had like philosophical objections to it

289
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
That like

290
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
What makes life

291
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
Great and worth living is that it is this bleeding thing at

292
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
Temporary hem

293
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,535
And when you are trying to constantly record it and capture it

294
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Georgia

295
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Taken away from that

296
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Aspect of life

297
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,215
Play don't keep trying to capture like the essence of this thing just

298
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
Be in the essence of a thing

299
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
David

300
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Saying that

301
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
You know he's recording all the time as to not miss anything and Marcus saying that no by recording all the time

302
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
You are missing everything

303
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Yeah

304
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
If you're missing the important things

305
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
And the doctor finally she

306
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
Said he didn't want to be recorded anymore and it was like really getting away by friendship cuz like

307
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,655
What puts a ceiling on where your relationship can go when someone

308
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Feels like

309
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,591
They can't open up to you in that way it just puts this wedge between you and the way that's just like awful did you stay

310
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,943
Stop recording at this point for well I couldn't stop I got that fire just like

311
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
I don't know whether it was OCD or whatever was like I was just like I couldn't stop recording and so I was always recording and

312
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
The recording was like

313
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Almost like a uniform for this

314
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Person that I wanted to be was like

315
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
It's like you're on in a play

316
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
And

317
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,703
You think you're living this life and then when the disc stops suddenly like the lights go up in your realize

318
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
It's all fake

319
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Do you like face a dude like

320
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
You just drifting

321
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
At this point David has around

322
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
2000 hours of tape

323
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,647
Because he keeps on recording is not really hanging out with Mark anymore or any ends up just

324
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
Drifting down to New Orleans

325
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
This is not

326
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Grey long after Hurricane Katrina

327
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
And it's like you know like

328
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
You know I don't answer with a flood and is like

329
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
I'd like to listen to people like heroin Journeys

330
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
And then like all this Injustice is that they face

331
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
So we decided

332
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
To do something that he never really done before

333
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
And started interviewing

334
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,479
People have an assisted living in New Orleans East

335
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Telling their stories

336
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
That wasn't changed

337
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
Change that much since Katrina

338
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
With their permission not recording them secretly

339
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,351
So what did you leave those stories on too

340
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,447
New Orleans Public Radio Station wwoz Street Talk

341
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Stories of New Orleans cultural rebuilding

342
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
I'm telling you man I appreciate that discipline

343
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
Cuz I have growing up man I was growing up

344
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Just terrible

345
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,223
Then at night he go home and

346
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,783
And he would listen to audio from The Wire

347
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,855
Tape of like me and some bar and

348
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
I think

349
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Super drunk and it's like

350
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,680
What did I think this matter

351
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Get out like

352
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Why

353
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Yeah

354
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
And then also dislike

355
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Dynamic started to change my mind

356
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
We're like

357
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
It's one thing to record your own life

358
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,320
And then he asked me before I was also recording other people but it was always framed around me

359
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
And everyone else was just sort of like supporting characters

360
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Then I was like

361
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,768
This is not about me it's about other people and like

362
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,608
Suddenly it did start to feel dirty to record

363
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,960
People that was like all of that so we can go ahead and I just felt worse and worse about recording

364
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
And

365
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,824
And then I just stopped as I don't want to I don't want to do this anymore

366
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,688
What about that feeling you were talking about just moments ago or wear without

367
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
The recorder

368
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Recording what's happening

369
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
You felt as if you were missing out

370
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
That experience was kind of wasted

371
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
Because you hadn't got the chance to record it

372
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
I mean I didn't go away that definitely didn't go away

373
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
I mean I feel like that's still to this day

374
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
I sometimes feel like man I wish I was recording this you know

375
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
But

376
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,520
Force me to really think hard about what moments in life

377
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
We're worth capturing 120

378
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
He doesn't like it if you do try to

379
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Capture a moment

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Then

381
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
You're kind of

382
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Out of them

383
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
But if you don't

384
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Then

385
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
It's gotten

386
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,392
Recording has the potential to be lost

387
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,208
Right I think that yeah we all can relate to this idea

388
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
But for David

389
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
The Crux of that

390
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
Pension do it or not to do it like

391
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,472
That became really difficult after him in part because of what happens next

392
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Few months after he had quit recording are you starting to mark

393
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,128
Who I am so back from Seattle is very

394
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
Happy to hear the David wasn't recording anymore

395
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,552
And some are decided to go down to New Orleans and visit David and their buddy Danny was down there too

396
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
And

397
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
And this is hard cuz I haven't really

398
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,048
Hold the real story about half with Mark I'm trying to think

399
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,656
I'll tell you the real story and

400
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,496
Dan and Danny and Mark and I were really close the three of us

401
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
And one thing we do

402
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,640
A couple times a year we would all go out to the mountains together and just have this

403
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
Great trip together like as friends

404
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
And so

405
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
We are going to do that in New Orleans and so

406
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
Garner bikes and we wrote down to the river

407
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
And

408
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,304
Set along the river for a while and then we took the ferry over to the

409
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Westbank the other side of the river

410
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,472
New Orleans is like glittering across the water got stoned and it was just

411
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,568
Magical like that for a long time to talking like having those who deep

412
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
Philosophical conversations for the first time in a long time that was not recording wasn't worried about capturing the moment

413
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
So my mind was free to not think about the recording

414
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
Pinot and then I was actually

415
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
More present in some way you know

416
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
And it just felt like

417
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,560
It always did when we were close back in the mountains in Colorado you know it was like a great

418
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Moment

419
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
And I wanted to keep hanging out there

420
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
And

421
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,800
Markers are getting kind of answer you wanted to go explore the city you know you want to go exploring and I was just like

422
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
Didn't really feel like I was just sort of like

423
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,968
Didn't want to be one of the people I was happy to be there with them and then Mark

424
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,528
Just jumped up and took off like

425
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
Bridget away and we were like well that was

426
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Weird uncle's very strange

427
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
David says that

428
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Mark said something in them on the butt

429
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Can't

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,864
I can't remember exactly what and so we like God on our bikes and we're only a

431
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,704
Maybe I don't know maybe a hundred yards 200 yards from the

432
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Very it was park there

433
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
And

434
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
By the time we got

435
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
To the bridge that connects the land

436
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,712
Fairy I saw that my bike was laying on its side

437
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
On the ramp

438
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
I was like well that's weird you know my mind and my life take it back about it I feel like I'm having very slowly why is ma

439
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
Mark cycling down why

440
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
All those people shouting they're looking

441
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
End of The River Why are they looking over and then I look in there over and there's mark

442
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Annies

443
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,264
Swimming in the Mississippi and he shouting something and I can't figure out what he's saying and I was just like

444
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Holyshit like

445
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
This is really bad

446
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,456
And I got really really scared I look Danny and Danny looked

447
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Totally terrified

448
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
And

449
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
She started again I was going Downriver I was just the river and so there was a point

450
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
I could see

451
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,768
Off the distance there was a boat like a rescue boat or something and gotten in the water

452
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:14,400
And Mark started to drift around bent and he disappeared out of you

453
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
How to walk up and down

454
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
The river

455
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Looking for Mark

456
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
They couldn't find him

457
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
Then it gets dark

458
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,384
And then he might just head home

459
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
And wait for news there

460
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
The next morning

461
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Still no news

462
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Few days later

463
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,648
Authorities 8 they gave up their official search for Mark and in assume that he was dead

464
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
And a week or so later

465
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
They found his body

466
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Get drowned

467
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
And I should just add

468
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
But there is

469
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
No reason to suspect that this was a suicide

470
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Yeah I'm sorry the mark

471
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Batman tits

472
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,312
Sensitive story to hear

473
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
Thinking about this is Allen's of like you being with someone who has a

474
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,576
Compulsion and Obsession that is now under control but still

475
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
Losing you

476
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Is there

477
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
I still is there a part of you that

478
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
Wishes you had been recording that day

479
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,032
I the thing is David says

480
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,384
You're not long after my cat died he started going through a lot of his old recordings

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
And sometimes you would hear on the these great

482
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Moments what you got two of them

483
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
But a lot of times he says it

484
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Almost like

485
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
You could hear that ceiling

486
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Platypus

487
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
According to put on his friendship with more

488
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,816
Man I want to f****** take a boat down the coast man so bad

489
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
I was acting

490
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:54,496
Different than I would have if I had been recording you know like I was conscious that I was on tape all the time

491
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
I also hear my cell phone's recordings often

492
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
Like stepping over him like

493
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
He'll say something and then I'll jump in in in in just like

494
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Clearly I'm just like you

495
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,928
I'm on my own black train of thought and I'm not really listening to him and that bothers me a lot

496
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm glad I don't have

497
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
I think I'm glad that I

498
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
It's just a hard cuz I'm on 100 glad that I don't have to

499
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
Live with that Taping that it doesn't exist

500
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
But at the same time David says

501
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
I feel like

502
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
Maybe I missed something and maybe there's some part of what happened the night that I can't

503
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
That I missed

504
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
All I Know It

505
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Is that

506
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,784
He just said let's get out of here and I jumped up and like

507
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
I don't remember exactly how he put it I just remember all said he was gone

508
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,000
If I had a recording maybe I could make sense of it and maybe something would be more clear about it

509
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,912
I think about that a lot then I also think what would have Mark what would Market wanted and

510
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
You know what

511
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
That probably

512
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Trump's whatever

513
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
Clarity I don't know I don't know ya but I still think about it a lot

514
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
So think about

515
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,528
What I would get from his recordings if I had them

516
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Random

517
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
I don't

518
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,584
