1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Before we start

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:03,840
Quick heads up

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,680
This episode contains some graphic language and descriptions of

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,728
Very sensitive sexual

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
Situations

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,032
Including discussions of sex

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
Consent and accountability

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848
You might be married if

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Are you awake

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,720
Radio WNYC

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab today we have parked

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
2

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
Of a three-part series that we're calling in the know

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
No as in an o

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
We were inspired to do this

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
After hearing a set of stories

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
On the show called The Heart produced by Kaitlin Prest

18
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Last week we played excerpts

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Of that series

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,856
And if you haven't heard of last week's episode I would encourage you to go back and listen

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
Is the stories that Caitlin told

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,000
We got some very intense reactions

23
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
For my license online all over the map

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
Have you feeling those stories that you made are a very

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Striking

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
Personal view of

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
Consent from the inside

28
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,824
Now it just so happens that Caitlin

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Produce those stories

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
In the spring of 2017

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Spring just before

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
All the accusations started hitting the news

33
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
First against Harvey Weinstein and then

34
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
Congressman like

35
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Al Franken

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Actors like Kevin Spacey

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Medians

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
And then in many cases the very people very men who are reporting about those stories

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
And much of what made it into the news with pretty clear-cut

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Criminal cases

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Or accusations of

42
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Clear breaches

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
Consent but then we started to hear about

44
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
The cases that were harder

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Not explicitly

46
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Criminal

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
More nuanced

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
That Gray Zone

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Which Caitlin was

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Exploring herpes

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,976
It occurred to us like a dick this is a conversation we're all trying to have right now

52
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,120
So what we started doing the wave listening to her stories was doing a series of interviews of our own with people

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
All over the map

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,056
Who are thinking and rethinking consent in interesting ways will play a couple of the next two weeks but we ran into one

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Particular

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Interview

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,760
See if it's working Kaitlyn you there yes I'm here

58
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
That we could not

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Stop thinking about

60
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,160
Santa created a lot of really difficult conversations internally

61
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
And so we just kind of decided why don't we play this thing relatively

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Raw

63
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
We don't do very often but let's just put it out

64
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
More or less how it happened in all of its flaws

65
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
Kaitlyn Kaylee can you hurry Hannah

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Yes it's out it's Hannah

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Hannah okay sorry Caitlin could you here hun I'm speaking can you hear me yes I can hear you

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Thanks for coming in

69
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
Both of you guys

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Thank you really glad to be here okay so since I'm already pronounce her name incorrectly can you tell me who you are

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
How to say your name what you do

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Sure my name is Hannah stotland

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm an independent consultant I work on

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Sorry I'm an independent educational consultant

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
And I specialize in

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,544
Educational crisis management

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Particular vantage point

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
On this whole set of questions

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
When I see a

80
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,736
Unfamiliar number from a distant area code on my phone

81
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
And if I can I pick that up

82
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,136
And it happens quite regularly. I pick it up and I just here sobbing

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
That's a mom whose kid just got expelled

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
So that happens

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
Regularly

86
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
More like

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Once or twice a month

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,240
Often the calls are coming from moms whose sons have been accused of some kind of sexual misconduct

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
I got my first two calls on that topic

90
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
In January of 2014

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,712
And since then it's grown and grown and grown about a third of my work now

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
I'm is students who are involved with

93
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Title Nine in one way or another

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
Title Nine is a federal law that deals with

95
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Among other things

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
Sexual harassment sexual violence on college campuses

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
What Hannah will do when she gets these calls it she'll work with these young men

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Havana Cuba

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
To get them back into school

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
By the school they were in

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
But more often it means transferring to a different School

102
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
So families hire me to help their

103
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,639
Kids get into a college or grad school usually

104
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
I think it is a good thing

105
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
When people in general

106
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,807
Even people who may have done something very bad

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,671
Who want education can continue to get education

108
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
As long as they're seeking it honest

109
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,143
What if you but what if you're then just deferring the problem is some of the campus I mean let's say there's a guy who

110
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Victimize somebody

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
And then you help him get to another College where maybe they do it again

112
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,663
Well that they be in the community one way or another and I think this is an area where I

113
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
See a lot of problems with

114
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Classism

115
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
And probably racism to

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
We're we're so concerned about that accused person being on another college campus

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
If he isn't on a college campus where do you think he's going to be

118
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Cuz he's not going to jail

119
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
The student said we're talkin about typically the police don't even get called but if they do they come and see

120
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
The evidence to say this evidence is so thin

121
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,383
You know we're not we're not even going to impose charges

122
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
So

123
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Saiino okay well he's not going to college anymore he's going to work at McDonald's and so if there's a risk to that fellow people at McDonald's and weed

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
You just don't care

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,951
Because they're not the upper middle-class white women who were actually worried about

126
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
On the college campus

127
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
And

128
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
I have misgivings about the ideas at

129
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Did the

130
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
College students are special needs

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,079
Community needs special attention that other young adults don't need

132
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,919
So you're interested so that I know that I have your point of view that I understand it

133
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Is that you don't

134
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
It's not that you

135
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Don't sink

136
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
But some people should be

137
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Spelled sometimes

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
Oh sure they sure that yeah okay

139
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
But

140
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
I feel very comfortable

141
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
With the idea that

142
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
People who want to continue their education

143
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Audi be able to make their case

144
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Friday

145
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Want to continue it

146
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
What I do

147
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Is help them talk about what happened

148
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
So if you're interested in covering it up or hiding it

149
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
There's no reason to hire me

150
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
I hope you have that hard conversation or write that difficult essay

151
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
About what went wrong

152
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Even if

153
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
You feel you were wrongly accused

154
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
You were railroaded by the school

155
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
You better find

156
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Unwise choices that you made

157
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Selfish choices that you made

158
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,895
There are not a lot of these cases where I think well you handled everything perfectly you didn't make any

159
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Risk preferring choices

160
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
There's nothing you could change

161
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
To keep this from happening to you in the future

162
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
You still have to tell a story

163
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
About mistakes that you made

164
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
And how you're working to fix

165
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
How does that go I mean do you find that

166
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
People will maintain that like will they sort of hold on to the idea that they did have consent even if the other person says

167
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
But they didn't

168
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
And imma try my Facebook

169
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
I'm not necessarily trying to change their mind about whether they had consent

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
That means they were there and I was not

171
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
At the City Museum

172
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
It in a scenario where you have both sides of the story

173
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
What's the usual difference

174
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,255
It depends there's a few cases where the stories just are incompatible

175
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
But there are

176
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Most of my cases

177
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
The dispute is narrow

178
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Everybody agrees that the encounter was

179
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Generally consensual

180
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
But

181
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Either the consent to all of it was withdrawn

182
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
According to the Accuser

183
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Or there was consensus to access A and B but not C

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
And see just happened before they knew it and

185
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
There wasn't a conversation about it and

186
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
One party feels that c was

187
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Arepa

188
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,567
Or that snow I agree I acted like I wanted this the whole time and maybe even I said yes

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,639
But in retrospect I was too drunk or high

190
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
And that. Consent was no good and nullifies Atkins

191
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
At this point in the conversation we talked a little bit about like

192
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
The different kinds of cancer

193
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
What works like affirmative consent

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Marissa Bell

195
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Clear

196
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
Permission often verbal permission that can be withdrawn at any time which Hannah says she is all 4000%

197
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
Question is if you don't do it is it rape

198
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
And

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,239
That's the dichotomy that I object to

200
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
Or I'm a skeptic about I should say I mean if if

201
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
Again if people can show me that this works and I'm interested but when you say I guess that's a thing like when you say if

202
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
People can show me if this work

203
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,599
Can you cut sirloin pack what you mean by that like

204
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Let me get it seems so clear to me that it does work

205
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Let me tell you a few stories there's a couple that I can give more identifying information about because

206
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
That this

207
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
The case is in litigation now and so that's on the public record and the fact that I'm involved in the case is on the public record so I

208
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
I can say a few more things

209
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Facetune

210
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
He had a girl wearing his room

211
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
After party they didn't know each other well

212
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
He touched her private parts

213
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
And there was vaginal penetration

214
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
With his fingers

215
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
Both parties agree

216
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
That he asked for and got affirmative verbal consent

217
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
He said do you like this and she said yes

218
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
And she faked an orgasm

219
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
Both parties are telling the exact same story

220
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
And he was found responsible for sexual assault cuz she says I didn't mean it I said yes I was enjoying it

221
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
In order to get it over with faster

222
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,159
I wanted a graceful way to leave his room and I saw it

223
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
Making him think I was having an orgasm

224
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
Would would help me get out of there more gracefully without being rude

225
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
And he will have to see that Monday for two and a half years I'll let you finish I'll let you finish and then I'll say what I think

226
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,567
Close my my

227
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
I mean this

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
That's that's when singing practice

229
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
You know it's it's

230
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Other other cases that I've seen

231
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
Is someone who basically my my student

232
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Is big black guy

233
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
You know well over six feet tall a lot of muscles he's an athlete

234
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
And

235
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
It's Undisputed that

236
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
That

237
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
He and the accuser were in her dorm room together

238
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
To hook up

239
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
They took off all their clothes

240
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
And

241
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Chi

242
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
Touched his genitals and

243
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Performed oral sex on him

244
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
And

245
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
She said

246
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
That

247
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
She did that because

248
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
She was fearful once they were both naked

249
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
I'm and she felt that

250
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
The situation was so overwhelming that she had to

251
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
Reach Out And Touch him

252
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
And then reach out and use her mouth on it

253
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
And the school decided in that situation

254
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
Is that the only thing that had gone wrong

255
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
Was that there wasn't a verbal confirmation

256
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
And so

257
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
If if you go in somebody's dorm room you take and both of you take off your clothes

258
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
And she

259
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
Touches you in places your penis in her mouth when you're not speaking

260
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
She has not conveyed consent

261
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
Which I think something is yeah

262
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Yeah I guess from my from my point of view like the rules rsr setup

263
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Up and Away

264
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
That the kind of protect

265
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
The person who feels violated like it

266
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Like I guess to me

267
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,023
There's a man who feels violated

268
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
Sorry but we're not supposed to be concerned about who feels violated we're supposed to be concerned about who was

269
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Violated

270
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
Yeah but I mean I guess

271
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
The person who was violation

272
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
I mean if they feel violated then I would argue that they are they bad were violated

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,391
What I'm saying is that like I think that having affirmative consent be

274
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,999
A rule that's that's that's followed and taken seriously when it comes to like

275
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,143
Legal stuff it just protects that ambiguity you know it if it's favors

276
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
For not getting the verbal yes

277
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
What message about definitely complications

278
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,687
What I think it's complicated but I think that it it it makes it so that the person who

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,783
Was violated feels violated is the one

280
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,903
Who's always protected and who's the one who's always in the right and I think that that's a good thing

281
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Yeah I don't agree with you about that I don't know they're always in the rain

282
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
I don't think they're always in the right

283
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
They're always in the right but I think that it's

284
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,263
Safer to assume that they're always in the right is going to be a very small margin of people who are not

285
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
But I feel like

286
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
It's important

287
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,223
But how do I access my that's just my point of view how do we know how small that margin is

288
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
I don't know how small it is

289
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
I mean

290
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm thinking to

291
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Various

292
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Various encounters that my students have had for example where

293
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
They both agree that they were having consensual intercourse

294
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
And they both agree that the consent was withdrawn

295
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
During the Intercourse and the theater.

296
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
The dispute is about how rapidly

297
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Stopped

298
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
And so and and their

299
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Isn't

300
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
You know in that case I I just

301
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
I just hesitate to say it in again in it it's it seems

302
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,303
Clear on paper it at the absolutes of that what you control your body II you convey

303
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
For example

304
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Start to cry during sex

305
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,007
Alright well then okay I would assume non-verbally that

306
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
This should stop or you know we should make sure

307
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
And it didn't stop but

308
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
You know did that take

309
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,527
2 seconds 5 Seconds 30 seconds

310
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
And that

311
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
From from the the moment of

312
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,071
You know what should you reasonably

313
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
Be aware of and I am very uncomfortable with the idea that

314
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Person has feelings

315
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
Determine whether person B's Behavior was rape or not

316
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
Because I always calling it rape I mean sometimes it would also if it's called sexual assault

317
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
You know sexual assault I feel like that's a really

318
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Important distinction

319
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
But like the terms even sexual assault is not it is not adequate you know because there are so many different grade

320
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
Gradations but I don't think I don't I don't think like I don't think

321
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,423
I I personally I do I do think that if someone

322
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,775
It's someone's feelings should determine whether person be

323
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
Have assault at them like I think even thinking about like when someone cries in the middle of sex

324
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,319
You know like talking about talking about like that is it is it 5 seconds is it 10 seconds is it 30 seconds

325
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Like what are all the things that happened leading up to that moment

326
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
What cuz he eats

327
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
He disputes he says

328
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,791
I stopped as soon as I realized she was crying yeah

329
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
And she says she says

330
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,703
I I was I was crying for like 25 seconds less than 30 seconds

331
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
And so that

332
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
Period between when I started crying and when he realized I was crying

333
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,967
But I feel like temp to me when I hear a story like that

334
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,599
I think that there was actually a lot of other there are probably a lot of other things leading up to that moment

335
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
That we're not

336
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Received you know or that the reason why she's coming forward and saying that this was an assault this was a violation

337
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
There's probably a lot there's a

338
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
An unseen architecture 2-2.

339
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Did that story

340
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:20,127
That is really complicated I guess like I could I don't think that someone would just come out and be like I cried for 30 seconds and then

341
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
You didn't you didn't stop like it's probably a lot it goes it runs

342
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,599
Much deeper than that there was something there's something unnameable happening in that room

343
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,231
And she sort of hinges that unnamable feeling of a violation on

344
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,071
This is a field trial is Trivial when you talk about it out loud

345
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
But she's trying to say something was not right here you know I agree

346
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Yeah

347
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,383
So I very much agree to get into the complicated area of a kite

348
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,479
Terry we agree on a whole lot that

349
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,039
I don't dispute at all

350
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,159
I see even and even in my cases where have the most doubt about what happened

351
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:09,279
I don't dispute that the accuser feels violated I think I think that's

352
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
True

353
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,423
They usually can be violated she is violated

354
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,103
Because there's all kinds of reasons besides being sexually assaulted that a person might feel violated

355
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
I'll talk about

356
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
One instance

357
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
For myself

358
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135
You don't work the people have broken my heart when I was in love with people

359
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
And

360
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
You know there was a breakup where I got treated like dirt

361
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
When we were in love and like knew each other's family isn't all of that and then you know basically ghosted me and then

362
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Don't me

363
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Free phone call

364
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
10 months

365
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
I felt extremely vile

366
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,735
I can't put into words how bad he made me feel

367
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Ito en +

368
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
How

369
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,695
It colored my memory of every interaction weed had for 10 months

370
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
And Christmas together with my family Hawaii

371
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
You know and and

372
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
Calling into question you did

373
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
Was he lying to me then

374
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Feel very exhausted by his

375
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,895
It's probably not a word I would have come up with

376
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
But I

377
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Feel

378
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,807
Unbelievably. I'm happy married now it's all good

379
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,903
You know I should not have ended up with him

380
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
But especially at the timing that that was an experience that permanently changed me I'm not the same person I was before that heartbreak

381
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Sexually assault me

382
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
You know this is it was it was awful what he did

383
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
I I just make sense to me that people could be unbelievably deeply hurt

384
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,039
Buy all kinds of behavior that isn't sexual assault

385
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
But I can

386
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
I can see that I can see I can see

387
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
I can see that but I guess I feel like

388
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,375
You know what we're doing right now is working against history you know like I think that we're trying to

389
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,751
Make progress on on this issue of sexual assault and the much larger issue of

390
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,871
The imbalance of power as it is distributed between the genders

391
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Like

392
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
Right can you ever really

393
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
As a woman and this is I don't know if I fully agree with what I'm about to say but it's just I'm just posing it as a as a Fil-A sauce

394
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Topical question

395
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
You know if you're if you're taught from birth to Define your pleasure based on someone else and someone else's pleasure

396
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,887
How can you even know what you want or don't want

397
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,495
In those private moments you know in like how do we restore that that balance

398
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,823
Sino yeah I think a lot of what you're describing is

399
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
On a

400
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,199
What I'm seeing as a as a generational divide

401
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm in in feminism

402
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,623
I don't know how old you are on 42 yeah I'm I'm I'm 30 yeah

403
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Yeah women who are my age and older

404
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
I find tend to agree with me

405
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
And the women who are

406
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
College major in their twenties now often don't

407
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,312
And the disconnect stems I feel like when you were describing

408
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
How because of

409
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,224
Societal pressures and training from birth and all that

410
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,600
When the man was naked in my room I could not do anything but give him a blow.

411
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
I could not say no

412
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
And I would say you did not say no

413
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
And there may be

414
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Situations

415
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,704
Where we agree that this is a Kent situation

416
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
But I don't see it as

417
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Positive

418
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
4

419
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
My feminism

420
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
Agency

421
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,552
They put her in a pink dress. She has to give a b******

422
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,672
I understand that and I think that's a really important point of view but I also I guess

423
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
People have done research about that the fact that like young girls Define how good sex was based on

424
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,472
How much they perceive the other person enjoying it and then an even something as simple as that creates

425
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:40,128
Up a power Dynamic and I feel like I'm not really seeing the men and the minute I know the

426
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,528
The young man that I know I'm not seeing them understanding the power that they have that's really easy to

427
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
YouTube to abuse you know and like how do you fix that that's what it's kind of all comes down to and like there has to be

428
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
What there has to be some kind of consequences if we're going to see a change

429
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back to

430
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
This conversation between Kaitlin Prest Hannah Stalin and myself just Mom

431
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
Hello my name is Erin Davis I'm calling from Tempe Arizona

432
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056

In the modern world more information about Sloan at www.slha.org

434
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,064
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

435
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
And I'm here because I need your help

436
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
And I request

437
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,864
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

438
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,264
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

439
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
So did something

440
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

441
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,272
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

442
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

443
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

444
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

445
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
If you have a story

446

Thank you so much

451
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,216
Amgen having rods Radiolab we're back with the second episode in a three-part series that we're doing inspired by

452
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Collaboration with Kaitlin Prest

453
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
It's called in the know

454
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,664
And we're going to jump back into the conversation that Caitlin I were having with Hannah Scotland before we do

455
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
I want to bring some other voices

456
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Cuz Allen

457
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
Where you're sitting and wouldn't I just place you for that way I can just like soap

458
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
As we were working on this series

459
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,536
I mean it really was an exploration for us one of the things that happen along the way as we can be in groups of college students

460
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
In different spots across the country

461
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
Groups of college-age men and women on my colleagues back a wrestler and she Molle II or with women

462
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
Going to hear more from the women next week

463
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
Don't play with the bit of the man because

464
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
When Hannah and Kaitlyn and I were talking it called to mind

465
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Something that I heard a lot in these conversations

466
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
You have to take a leaf at some point

467
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,672
You have to take like you're talking to this person you're making eye contact whatever

468
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
And like it you can also can I kiss you

469
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
And Mike

470
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
They say yes but like at the same time

471
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
Sometimes you just go for it and like

472
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,728
That's where gets if he because of weather like

473
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Sacrificing that

474
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Is what we need to do

475
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
For no one to get raped

476
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
You know Nann

477
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,040
Super malicious scenarios like maybe what we have to give up is just

478
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
You're looking to rise the sun's Rising you're like

479
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
Hello would you

480
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,000
Can I record you on my cell phone if you saying you're down to make out right now

481
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
You know I mean

482
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
You know what something I guess I'm willing to give up if that's what's being asking if that actually solved the issue

483
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
I just think that we're coming to a point where that might be the line by the way

484
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,480
The thing you talk about that is actually an app that exists we talk to the guy who made it but what would he and other guys were

485
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Saying

486
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
We sit there on easy

487
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
They still feel somehow caught between those old gendered expectation that it's the man's job to pursue and

488
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
The world at war now which seems to not

489
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:18,144
Want that but maybe not entirely not not want that there. Sure and a lot of them

490
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Worry

491
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Then maybe they've already

492
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Cross the line

493
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
Without knowing it

494
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,384
Always in the back of my mind like I've hooked up with a girl that's like instigated it like

495
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
Like while having sex you decide that

496
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
But she doesn't want to be like she was going to

497
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Gets up late

498
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
You know like then what then if if

499
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
To the next day if she decides that

500
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
But she realizes that like if she did want to do that

501
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Maybe after the fact

502
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Then it just be my

503
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:51,680
I've definitely hooked up with people where they were very drunk the first time we hooked up

504
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
No one ever was like oh that was not okay or anything but

505
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,640
In all the situations I guarantee they thought myself I was drunker than the person I was hooking up with

506
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
But

507
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Because I'm a man

508
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,992
That could be retrospectively

509
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
That could have been sexual assault

510
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,392
That's definitely the biggest question I've been asking myself post

511
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
The thing is like wow

512
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,512
Could it even be claimed like I don't think that I sexually assaulted someone

513
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
At all I mean given that

514
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
You know what I asked are you sure but

515
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
That isn't even enough cuz that's a alcohol

516
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
You know even if you get a vocal consent

517
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
If there's alcohol involved

518
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,872
So I guess that's work at then just interesting nothing make a cold but yeah

519
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
Everything that you did make a mistake

520
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
Benson was like that wasn't okay what you did to me last night or something

521
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Right

522
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,928
You say your sorry I believe I really do understand that you don't like you learn like we now have to be I don't think my

523
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,328
Be free like but I understand that but if somebody says like you sexually assaulted me and if it's

524
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Situation like you're talking about where you both have been drunk

525
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
And you say I'm sorry is that not

526
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
I would be scared to say

527
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
That because

528
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
How to say what I'm sorry I'm sorry because that's like you're admitting you're guilty even if you don't think you are if you try to engage in a

529
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
Conversation like that so just maybe like you don't say I'm sorry say oh my God like please explain to me like how I did that were like what

530
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
What happened cuz I was too drunk to read

531
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Remember or like something like that

532
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
And after that you know after I

533
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Having

534
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,888
Pleasure after listening to these guys and then having this conversation with Caitlin and Connor I mean four

535
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
For 1

536
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:32,544
Things that they were afraid of her exactly things that we were talking about into I started to think about the

537
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Fear

538
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
That sort of ambient fear that was always in the room

539
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,968
Can you argue there something useful about the

540
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Fear

541
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Because that fear

542
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,136
Mike push these guys to address exactly what Kevin was just saying

543
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Am I push the guys too

544
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,304
What what what I what I hear over and over again when I talk to it when I talk students is that

545
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,168
The women in the end I get a sexual encounter are thinking about 12 things

546
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,312
And the guys are thinking about one thing which is themselves right they're just they're not reading the room they're not reading their partner

547
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
What's going to change that if not fear

548
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
Like the fear these guys feel right now could actually make them

549
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Start to pay attention

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
Make us I should say start to pay attention

551
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Yes it might

552
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
I certainly think of my

553
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
SA

554
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Writing support

555
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
As a form of Education

556
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,352
Coaching how a student should handle

557
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
A tough situation

558
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
I'm not sure that

559
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Making the consequence

560
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
It's really bad

561
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Is what

562
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,408
Makes it more likely that the behavior will change

563
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
But

564
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
I would love to see

565
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Young men

566
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Encouraged

567
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
To go through the kind of

568
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Analysis of their actions

569
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Is that

570
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
My new with me and it and it's

571
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,120
I think it's a really positive process for that man and

572
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
I see what looks to me like greater insight

573
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,800
Tonight it's going to bring it back to the moment itself

574
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Cuz a lot of what we're talking about

575
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
On a macro level

576
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
Still have to be negotiated in these moments right

577
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
And you've talked about

578
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,672
The idea of we need a reasonableness standard for for the consensual moment

579
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
What does that mean

580
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Do you

581
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
So to me it means that

582
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,168
Communication needs to be in a shared language

583
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
You know if if someone says to me in Russian

584
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
That doesn't feel good

585
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
I just don't speak that

586
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,200
So is it reasonable to expect me to understand

587
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
What this person was conveying

588
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
In a language that I don't speak

589
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,440
Like I would consider trying to be a universal language now if it's dark

590
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
And

591
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,328
You're not touching the person's face whatever you might not realize immediately

592
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
That they are

593
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Crying without

594
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
You know it's not why Loctite crying

595
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
I was just it's

596
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,616
Tears and and and emotion and punch throat and all that

597
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
How rapidly is it reasonable to expect

598
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
That you pursue

599
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,064
Steve that communication which it is communication

600
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
And if you could see the person's face

601
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
That I dated Ariana ambiguous

602
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Communication

603
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,072
It is it reasonable to think it might take you a minute

604
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
To to realize that

605
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,728
My partner's feelings are totally changed

606
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:48,640
So there's a there's a spectrum between saying no no no stop and expecting somebody read your mind

607
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
Right that there's a million different ways to convey that

608
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,040
With different levels of urgency and clarity

609
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,368
And I just think we should we should take into account

610
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
What can we reasonably expect

611
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
Him in this scenario to realize

612
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
About her changed frame of mind

613
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
What do you think

614
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
For me I think a step forward is just being aware of the power dynamics that are happening in sex talking about them explicit

615
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,896
Italy understanding what they are understanding the ways that they're fun the ways of their pleasurable

616
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,968
And I'm being really open

617
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:30,368
About those things and I think that like it all comes back to the communication I mean like I really like

618
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,256
What you said Hannah about the about the languages you know figuring out how to speak each other's languages

619
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Figuring out truss

620
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
And also just like

621
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,448
Having there be less of a stigma around conversations explicit open

622
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
Totally Shameless conversations about sexuality

623
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Would bring us

624
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
Forward and in massive massive leaves around this stuff

625
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,016
And also just sit like that they gave me I think the thing that I'm not seeing that I wish I did see was just

626
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Giving a s***

627
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
You know that Karen likes having

628
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,952
Had like we know when somebody says hey that that experience sucked for me

629
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,608
Having the other person be like Wow Let's talk about it are you okay you know it cuz I got to like so many situations would

630
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,984
Would be would be would be solved if that was a dynamic as opposed to what are you talkin about

631
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Like

632
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
The gaslighting all that stuff

633
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,616
Yeah that's my little Mexico

634
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
The work I do with some of the students

635
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
When I say so what do you regret

636
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
And sometimes you're not sure they're like a really didn't attack her

637
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,976
And I said but do you regret is it ever your goal

638
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,584
To get into your bed with someone and have them walking away going up I'm glad that's over

639
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
And the guys like no I don't want that and I was like well

640
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
That's what you got

641
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,568
And we can't dispute we can dispute whether it was an assault or not

642
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,128
It is objectively the case

643
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
But this person had a bad experience with you

644
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Everybody agrees on that

645
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
And if that wasn't what you wanted to happen

646
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:09,184
Then you probably have regret about that I should have done something differently so it didn't come out that way

647
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
I'm not telling them what they ought to want sexually

648
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
But I do tell them

649
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
To consider what they want sexually

650
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,288
It is it is not I want to preface this by saying I'm not saying that the training of men and women is symmetrical it's not

651
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
But that some of them

652
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
May may realize

653
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Some of the men

654
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
May realize

655
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,344
You know what I was told that men are supposed to like any any kind of sexual contact we can get from anyone anywhere we're supposed to be happy

656
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Happy about that

657
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
And is that actually what I want or is that what

658
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,792
People expect me to want and maybe I would prefer more of a

659
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,400
You know loving gentle kind of relationship

660
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,776
Maybe I'm the man and not that kind of model would actually work better for me

661
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Then this Conquest model

662
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,712
Interesting cuz it made what I hear a lot coming out of the me-too movement is that I hear a lot of women saying

663
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Guys you need to do the work

664
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,832
Okay like this is this is largely your work to do

665
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Right now

666
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
And I hadn't expected

667
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
To hear you

668
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Talking about

669
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,328
What you do as in substance being part of that like you are actually

670
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
It seems

671
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,168
Involved in some of the guys doing the work

672
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
I ain't like how to do the work

673
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,824
Is its own sort of can of worms like which is something we haven't really talked too much about

674
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,640
But it is interesting to hear that I wasn't expecting

675
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
That to

676
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:38,016
Medication assistance that it's not necessarily Michael

677
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,160
But it may be necessary in order to achieve my goal which is to help you advocate for your education

678
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
You can't do that effectively

679
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Unless you've been thoughtful about your past

680
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
And

681
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,680
Might my thesis is gray help the kids

682
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Caesar Gray

683
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
And

684
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
You know this is this is not a binary world we live in in terms of gender in terms of communication

685
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
And and to some extent I feel like we have

686
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
2

687
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Work with

688
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
The complexity of what's in front of us

689
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,416
Even if we wish it were black and white and that would make our job a lot

690
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
Caitlin any final thoughts

691
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
Amen no I don't think so

692
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
I guess

693
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Yeah this is the

694
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Great combo

695
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,680
I want to thank Kaitlin Prest and

696
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Hannah Stalin for sitting down to talk

697
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,592
Few notes before we close if you have experienced sexual assault

698
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
There are resources out there to support you and the national sexual assault hotline at 1 800 6 5 6

699
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
Hope that is 1 800 6 5 6

700
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
467 3

701
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,512
Can provide support and connected resources in your local area and also one thing I do

702
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
I want to add

703
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,656
Is this conversation recently aired it without a ton of edits

704
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Amendments is that
