00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
There he goes

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568

Abba today

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
I thought play the very first story lot of did for us

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
This goes back aways

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
The time he was a grad student at Harvard

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,840
He written us an email saying hey are you guys into Old robots

35
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
Like robots that are few hundred years old

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
And then he had a whole list of them

37
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
Like for example picking up

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
The story

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Heard

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,896
Rumors whispered by Soren mostly about a pooping duck

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,712
Ippudo to the pooping duck is really famous

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,552
The duck was really eating and pooping but they had like a store of like

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
Pre pre poops

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
I don't know what it was looks like duck poop maybe and you would see this robot duck and then watch it actually poop

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,864
She sort of this in this out and they believe that people thought this was this was a pooping duck

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,984
And we talked about a bunch of these ancient robots it kind of funny

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
About one in particular

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
It was

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Actually was

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Hannah Honda

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
It's not poop at all

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
So the year is

53
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
1562

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
450 years

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Not so long after Columbus

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
Ferdinand and Isabella of Denton has a new king of Spain

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Phillip Phillips

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
The seventeen-year-old

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Crown Prince

60
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
His name is Don Carlos

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
One day he's in the Royal lodgings

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
I was walking down a flight of stairs

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Trips

64
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
He falls

65
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Bashes head

66
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
Against a door near the bottom of the sea

67
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
Is the Crown Prince Hussein Crown Prince of

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,456
So this is a national Calamity The Heir Apparent

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,320
Doesn't look like it such a bad injury still conscious

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
But then his head starts to

71
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Swell to this kind of crazy size

72
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,256
He becomes delirious and fever issues struck blind

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,072
And so at this point the the king comes

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Tribe is King Philip

75
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
Second so he is at this time he's the most

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Powerful man in the world

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Right so you basically control

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
The Mall of the Americas he controls much of Europe the Philippines is named after him he was tight with the

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Hope that this time the Pope in the king were kind of like

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
You know

81
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
BFF to the Holt Spanish Court

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
I'm across the country people are

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Seeing this reading this as a kind of sign that

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
The gods very angry

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
Until they're there fasting they're doing this

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Prayer possessions things like

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
According a lot if the king

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Calls all the best doctors near me

89
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Come

90
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,872
To Spain to help his son and these doctors are trying everything they are drilling a hole in skull

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
To relieve the pressure to relieve the pressure they are

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,832
Leaving him and blistering him and they are purging him to the extent that he has like

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
20 bowel movements within just like a certain few hours

94
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
They're like

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Smearing all over the wound there they're smearing like turpentine and honey and for Don Carlos

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Even after all of this

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
They look at each other they look at him and it's kind of like

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
This is

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
He's going to die

100
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
So he's dying

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
He's basically on his

102
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
So at this point getting a lot

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Peking

104
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Goes to the Sun

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927

Quite

114
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Heuristic

115
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
Of a human being to say to God the most powerful men in the world

116
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,599
World is he is a God among men really yeah this is this is what he says okay

His son

119
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975

I had this dream that's a great story

133
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
This is Elizabeth King artist and professor in the sculpture department at Virginia Commonwealth

136
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Morning

137
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
Saying that had a dream

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079

Holding a cross

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
And basically told him

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
You're going to be fine and that's quite well documented

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,863
Apparently there was a witness in the room in the sitcom with an at night

148
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
Talking to a ghost hoodie mumbling things

149

00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Show me the scene where you could kind of see

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,775
I'll wait till the two men in bed together

190
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
One guy who's alive barely and another guy's been dead a hundred years

191
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,295
Caught in the middle. Philip II

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
Who has asked God for miracle God came through

193
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Do the smog

194
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Now fill the second is like

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
I got to deliver King Philip II always got a miracle

196
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
That Miracle after the break

197
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Hey this is Brian in Red Bluff California

Information about Sloan at www.slha.org

201
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,087
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

202
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
And I'm here because I need your help

203
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
This summer

204
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
And I request

205
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

206
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

207
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
So did something

208
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

209
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,295
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

210
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

211
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,815
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

212
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

213
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
It doesn't have anything to do with a test if you have a story

214
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
T-shirt with us

215
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

216
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
Record a short audio message for us

217
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,271
And that's radiolab.org brilliance

218
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Thank you so much

219
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,727
I'm Jedi boom Rod this is Radiolab let's return outdoor story from lots of Nasser where we left off

220
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
It is 1562 in

221
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
King Philip is on the hook

222
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
He knows he owes God a miracle

223
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Acutely aware of this

224
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Really

225
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Renowned

226
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Clockmaker

227
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Clockmaker

228
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
Yep names of juanelo turriano

229
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
A huge bear

230
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,655
A big box of a man described as always being filthy and blustery

231
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
And not a lot of fun to be around

232
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
Butter great great clockmaker

233
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Certainly among the best

234
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
In Spain

235
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
So the King goes to the sky

236
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
And he says like I want you to make

237
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
A mechanical version

238
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
I'm Diego.

239
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,231
What a mechanical version of this 100-year dead

240
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
Holy priest

241
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Like a mechanical mod

242
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
A robotic Padre

243
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Yeah which

244
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
And this I did not

245
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Expect

246
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
Still exists now the most bodies in the Smithsonian perfect working order no way

247
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
77

248
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
The first time I saw this figure

249
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
I was

250
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
Drawn to it and then repel

251
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
That's Carlene Stephens she is a curator at the Smithsonian in DC about a week after a lot of nice

252
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
I spoke

253
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,607
We ended up in DC meeting with her and she showed us

254
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
The Monk

255
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Who lives in a little glass case

256
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
What we have here

257
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Is an otamatone

258
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Over foreign

259
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,271
Is this the first robot that we know of

260
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Ancient Greek

261
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Things that

262
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Could be considered

263
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Robot

264
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,975
Okay back to our story 450 some odd years ago

265
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Clockmaker

266
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
What's his name of Toriano he goes into his shop and he does whatever he does next one gear to another to another

267
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Hours weeks months

268
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,311
No idea how long it takes and I don't think anybody does City emerges one day

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
Into the bright sunshine

270
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Waze

271
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
A robotic Padre

272
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
Yeah it's a 15 inch high

273
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Figure

274
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
Made of wood and iron has dinosaur tablet has the sandals has the rosary has

275
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,439
And poking out of the top of the Habit is a little

276
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Mall

277
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Hairless

278
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Head

279
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Sharp nose

280
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Like a like

281
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
A razor and the rather ferocious

282
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
I

283
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Like Intense or like that

284
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Doing business like

285
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Unfocused

286
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,175
Like maybe I'm only 15 in tall but I am focused on something much bigger than you you human

287
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
So did you like

288
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Turn it on or push something

289
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,343
And why would I get on a train and go for 3 hours just

290
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Usher Yeah

291
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Okay do it

292
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
So Carling takes us out to the hall can we sit down on the floor

293
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Skip slatoff

294
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
A little brass key

295
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
He sticks it into the secret slot in the months

296
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Side

297
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
Counterclockwise you would tend to want to do it

298
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
And lots of

299
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Wines of the month

300
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Turning it

301
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Counterclockwise and it's

302
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Surprisingly

303
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,855
I'm so if you sort of wind out this receipt

304
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Spring

305
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Alright I'm going

306
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
I'm going put it on the ground

307
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,863
Let him go walk very slowly

308
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,495
One foot after the other coming out from under the casa can factors actually little wheels under there

309
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Coming out

310
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
It is turning from right to left

311
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
The eyes are rolling in the head the mouth is opening and closing if it's heard of muttering

312
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Prayer

313
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
The arms are in motion

314
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
One arm is Raising and lowering cost

315
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
The other arm is beating the chat

316
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
A symbolic gesture to a Catholic

317
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
It called the Maricopa after three or four steps

318
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,591
The arm holding a cross though something new

319
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
It moves to different new directions to bring the cross to the mouth

320
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
And the figure

321
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Kisses across

322
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,599
Oddly mesmerizing

323
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
The next thing is doing is it at

324
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Learning

325
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,511
And moving in a different direction and then walking its paces and kissing across

326
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
As we watched it it turn once then twice then three times

327
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,983
4 * let it go back to where it started imagining tables the number of people sitting around

328
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Probably it's going to start up

329
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
At one point or another head for you

330
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,895
And then turn away and head for someone else and turn away

331
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Why would the king of

332
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Spain

333
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
How who could have you know

334
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
I will build a church

335
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,975
Taking a crusade to Jerusalem done something new because of anything why

336
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Commemorate his son's Revival by making a little

337
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Automatic.

338
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
What was that for

339
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah lots of what was he thinking it's a good quote That's The $64,000 Question 2 grade question

340
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,895
The truth is there's really no way to know for sure

341
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
They got to rely on the vacuum

342
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
And it's not a whole lot of that in this case one interpretation

343
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Certainly could be that

344
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeah the king had this amazing miraculous

345
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,183
Thing happened to his son and now we had a way of sharing that

346
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
With his subjects

347
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
He's got this device worth it's a it's an illusion like the Machinery of it is completely him there's no visible

348
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
One of the craziest

349
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,775
Sports that it's all sort of hidden underneath the the robes at when he put it down on a table or in a

350
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Courtyard

351
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
People have seen it move on its own

352
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
It would have been amazed

353
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
As we were

354
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
And you could have said look here is the miracle

355
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Look what God did

356
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,111
For a country God like Spaniards what God did for Spain

357
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
Which would have been a useful thing for a king to Beyonce right

358
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
That's that's one

359
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
The other is it just on a more utilitarian level

360
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
This was a machine

361
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,655
That was built to pray and this was a period when you could buy

362
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
Prayer repetition so if you had the money you could get someone to pray for you

363
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
While you go do something else

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,871
Are those over here when you're covered you're covered

365
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
If you think about it from Philips perspective he needs to say thank you to God

366
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
And he had this thing that if you wound up

367
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Was an automated thank you machine

368
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,439
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you or could be

369
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
I love you I love you I love you and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry

370
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Please please please please

371
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
But if you need

372
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
But if you think about it more expensively

373
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Salata

374
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,311
What did it mean at that time to be a Catholic

375
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
What it really mean

376
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
What a nice robot

377
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,759
With maybe the best Catholic you could ever hope to be counted his prayer was was

378
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Was quite specific

379
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:04,671
In the sense that if you say the right things and and do the right actions

380
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
In the right order in the right time and in the right place

381
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
That's

382
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Prayer that's when God notices about method

383
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
It's about method it's about

384
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,239
Maybe this monkey says was like method embodied that's a good one

385
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
I mean why not

386
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
It is in fact

387
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Perfect

388
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
It repeats itself over and over and over

389
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,015
Replicates the idea

390
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,111
Is a little a little teaching object

391
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
Where is how you do it

392
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
This is the perfect prayer

393
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Perfect

394
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Price of doing it the perfect way every time and I because I'm I'm just in a lowly imperfect

395
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Human

396
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
I'm not I can only aspire to this

397
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Perfect piety

398
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
Are you making this up or do you think this might the month might have actually been seen this way, true I don't think I feel crazy

399
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
Especially if you think about what was happening

400
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
At that moment mrs. counter-reformation Spain right not so long after Luther eunos nailing Theses on

401
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,767
Has big debate raging about how actually do you get closer to God you have the kind of protest

402
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
With Luther were saying it's not about you know works it's not about saying something this many times it's about whether you feel

403
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
And then you have the Catholic argument which is to say

404
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
You do these rituals

405
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Because these are the ritual

406
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
I'm using the way you get this is the way to get close to God

407
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
How's the way to pray

408
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
You pray like this thing

409
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Just like this thing

410
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
If your Catholic can

411
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Gods of Catholic

412
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
I hope he is

413
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
If you're Philip II

414
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
You look at the sky

415
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
And you say God

416
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
You and me or Square

417
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
