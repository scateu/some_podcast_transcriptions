1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Anyhow

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
So what have you been up to any microphone

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
I think we're going to share cuz what else are we going to do

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
I think

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,560
Strike like a Viper Radiolab

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Go like this and today that's like that story about when things for

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,496
Far far away

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Combiner head

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Hit very close

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
Just put your hand on his forehead

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,736
Or over my bowel satisfying comes to us from producers Simon Adler

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
And anemic

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Okay okay

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,368
So you're going to tell something about something

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
Who should I start

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,208
Okay so

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
We've been exploring what happened on May 18th

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
2003

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
In the great city of Brussels

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
Specifically

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Skarbek

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Starbucks

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
When is mr. Gatti's in Brussels story starts with this

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
So

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
It was it was around

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
11:30 p.m. and I was

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
With one of my colleagues

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,248
Add a restaurant to have one of the good meal of the day

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
This

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Is Emmanuel Emmanuel Williams

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,696
I am the the one everybody calls when should hit the fan now let's put it that way

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,536
And that evening Emmanuel along with much of the rest of the country

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,608
Was waiting around for that day is national election

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
The results

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
For all the

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Difference parliamentary assembly

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
Manuel's mind was on something else

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,384
Because across the country that day millions of people had just voted on computers

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
Belgium was in the early days of experimenting with electronic voting

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
And so instead of filling

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Paper ballot in the voting booth with a touch screen computer and and folders with walk-in

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Insertive

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
White credit card size

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,048
Car tinting machine and then vote by selecting names on that

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,424
And I it was a manual job to make sure that all these hundreds of computers

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Work proper

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm an IT guy

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
Something like that at that point

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,128
At 11:30 at night after the polls are closed besides the usual

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Computer glitches

54
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
It seems like everything has gone well and so we were there were two of us

55
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
He and one of his fellow ID

56
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
If you guys waiting for the others I guess

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
To talk about the other on the back for a job well done and that's when the

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
That's when his

59
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Phone ring

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
It wasn't

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
And it was one of the officials of the ministry

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,008
They said that they had a problem that they had detected a problem in sky

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
And so some okay we're coming over

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
And so you pay the the check you hop in the car and I hope we paid the check.

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
15 minutes later they arrived together Black Escalade cuz I like to imagine and they they enter the polling

66
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,280
Station townhouse of Sky building with big tall ceiling

67
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,632
It's a very old building filled with this crowd of confused looking people

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,264
Well they explained to us that going through the numbers they noticed one of the contestants

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,408
Relatively unknown Communist Party candidate Maria vendaval gold had a very high number of votes

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
From this one

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Polling station

72
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
And taking a closer look

73
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
They noticed that the number of votes for this contestant was

74
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Impossible

75
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Impossible

76
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah if mathematical impossibility essentially she received more votes than there were voters who could possibly vote for

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
And so as a manual hearing this some serious is this just a fluke is there an explanation fraud

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Thinking fraud

79
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
I'm smelling

80
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
It could have been tampering

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,992
I could have been a bug it could have been a hardware glitch could have been you could be anything

82
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Yeah absolutely

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
First thing first they got all of the ballads

84
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Does white

85
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Plastic magnetic cards that the voters had loaded their votes on

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Recount it

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
Reinserting every single

88
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
Magnetic card one by one

89
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
Several hours so now it's like 1:30 in the morning and they print out

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
The new recounted

91
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
Hold it up against the old one and they

92
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
How are the exact same results

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
For every single contestant

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
To the vote

95
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
Except the contestants which had had this

96
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Abnormal number of folks

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
This time around Maria had far fewer

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
And at that point one of my college did the math

99
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:50,047
And set the difference between the number of votes she had in the first count and the number of votes she had in the

100
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
It's exactly 4090

101
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
4096

102
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Fewer votes

103
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Does that mean anything to you

104
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,079
4096 know it means nothing to me

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
Well 4096 is not a random number

106
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Is a

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
It's something about the number at this like I don't know. I don't know the answer but I have

108
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
This a deep sense

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
I'm feeling tingly

110
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
So if you guys are it people and you heard the number 4096 you feeling

111
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
Woodruff

112
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
To every it guy in the room

113
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Number 4096 West was very meaningful

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
In fact

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,127
It was a clue a clue to a cosmic culprit capable

116
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Is there a Bigfoot

117
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
Computers of swinging our elections

118
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
I can't float crashing our cars

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
And

120
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
Reminding us just how small and at the mercy of the universe

121
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
We really are

122
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,335
So it so it so why why is 4096 so important

123
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Okay well to explain

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,967
I'd like to backup

125
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Potato salad

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Do the morning of the alarm

127
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
Okay so cold open and at some point

128
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
Live there white card through that card reader in

129
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
Maria vendaval received her first book

130
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
The registers booth number one for Maria

131
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,495
Yeah now when that happened inside the computer in its memory

132
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Is 0 switch to A1

133
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,407
And I mean that both in terms of her vote total and also in in how a computer

134
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
The way computer works

135
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Is that everything is stored in memory

136
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
I memory is binary

137
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
It's either a 0 or a 1

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Either on or off

139
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Tear It Off

140
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
In one

141
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
I think we all know this right there

142
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Setmore we've heard it at least that deep down

143
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Computers is everything one

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
Enter in this specific case what what that means is

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
All these individual votes that Maria would get throughout the day

146
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
They were all stored as as just once

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
As these individual ones

148
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,663
Not when you're limited to Counting with just one way to do it is to tally

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Like you doing groups of 5 on a truck

150
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Diagonal line

151
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
But when that Telly starts to get high

152
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
It becomes incredibly inefficient

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Hope that way

154
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
So instead to save time energy and computing power

155
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Computers do a little bit of math

156
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
8 Day Count using powers

157
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Powers of 2

158
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Remember powers of 2

159
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
Made something squared

160
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,311
Exactly two squared or two to the second power 2 x 2

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Is 4

162
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
3rd power 2 X 2 X

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
2 is 8 to the 4th

164
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
16

165
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,063
Set a Rosetta Rosetta Rosetta so how is it a computer is doing that right

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,927
LP visualizes imagine inside a computer's memory there's this

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Dreaming of 13 Light

168
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
Light bulbs that it people called

169
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Each one representing a different Power of Two

170
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Stick with me here first

171
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
First light bulb represent anything to the zero power equals 1

172
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
Second light bulb

173
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Which is 2

174
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
The third bulb

175
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,087
Etcetera etcetera etcetera

176
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,439
When Maria received her first book

177
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
A little bit of electricity

178
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Was sent to that first light bulb

179
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
2 to the 0 is 1

180
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Now what you got her second vote this time some electricity was sent to that second ball

181
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Turning it on representing two

182
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,223
Because two votes are stored in that second light bulb what what the computer does simultaneously

183
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Is turn off that first

184
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,855
So to be clear when she got her second vote the first bald was turned off

185
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
Which represents ^ 1 with turn.

186
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
So it's now using only one bulb

187
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
To represent tube

188
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Oh okay

189
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Now in order to represent numbers that aren't powers of to all the computer does is turn on mulch

190
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Will bulbs at 1

191
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
A sequence

192
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,407
Of power to for example when Maria got her third returned on the Earth and

193
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Second light bulb because one plus two equals three when she got her fourth

194
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,183
It turned off the first and second light bulb and turn on the 3rd

195
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,767
V boat turns on the 1st and 3rd

196
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
What you got to say her 17th vote it is turned on V bald

197
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
16 + the first ball

198
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Equaling 70

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
And so on and so on adding up these powers of 2 and with that respect

200
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
4096

201
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Is a power of two

202
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
C2 that number is one that they're like

203
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Is that what that is

204
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
Yeah it's the 13th

205
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Bit of memory

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Which meant

207
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
That at some point during that day something somehow turned that bit off

208
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Flipped what should have been a 02 A1

209
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Yeah it was It was a

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
A binary flip

211
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983
Your mind just went there and he shouldn't

212
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah I love that you call the IT people are like

213
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,199
Oh and all the non it people are like what

214
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Well do he just trade

215
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,063
Okay so you know that it was just one bits

216
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Flipped

217
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
What will what does that mean

218
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
So we knew that

219
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
The results

220
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Could be

221
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Trace back to the 13th bit

222
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,911
Flipping what we didn't know was what caused the bit to flip okay so what would that's your next question what what

223
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
What could cause if it

224
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
The flip

225
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
No idea

226
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
What did you spend it could have been a could have been in any number of things

227
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,831
And so we each in the following days we got access to absolutely everything

228
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
First thing they checked could have been

229
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Software

230
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
So we carried out random tests on

231
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,791
Source code for any bugs that could have caused this bit to flip

232
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
But there was nothing

233
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
So we were fairly confident that it wasn't a software error

234
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Okay so if it's not software

235
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
It Hardware right well

236
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
We got the machine that was actually used in that polling station on the day of the election

237
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,503
And Counting and they ran a bunch of memory tests on it to see if something came up

238
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
To see if some defect in the physical memory could have caused

239
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Respectively what came back on that

240
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Nothing

241
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Not a single error

242
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
So the memory on that computer was working fine

243
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
What's up what the heck are you left

244
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Not much

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,007
As far as we were concerned this one computer had a glitch which called

246
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Give wrong answer

247
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,175
Unsatisfying answer that's the way things go we just simply had no proof

248
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
What caused the bit to flip

249
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
We just don't know

250
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
That's the way it it turned out

251
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,183
I'm so over the next couple of days Emmanuel and his

252
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Team sat down to write up defined

253
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Half expecting that once finished

254
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Report would be filed away

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Never mention

256
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
However hello hello Brussels can you hear us

257
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Hyzaar

258
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Simon in Smash

259
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
That was not

260
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
I have a

261
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Your guest here

262
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
I arms

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
He was plenty of tea

264
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Thank you

265
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Yeah thank you Natalie

266
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Hello

267
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Hello is this Zoe

268
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
Yeah yeah it's me hello

269
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
All thanks

270
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Tibet flight

271
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Zoe's you know I'm a member of the volume and and back in 2003

272
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,055
Young and freshly elected to Parliament Iowa's 28

273
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
429

274
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
What's the age of most of the MPC

275
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Yeah it's that

276
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,759
She was generally aware of what went down in scar back that there was a

277
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
This computer problem someone got some extra votes

278
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
It was read

279
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Trench

280
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
And for me

281
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
It was really

282
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Concern

283
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
Because our most concern is the people can trust the electronic system and wisdom

284
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
DeSoto

285
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
We are not sure the people can trust the system

286
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Tok we waited for the report of the specialist

287
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
And finally

288
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
But three weeks after the election

289
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
Yeah we only what we ended up writing that at some point during the day

290
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
The 13th bit

291
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Netflix

292
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
That's how we roll

293
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Basically

294
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Means nothing

295
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,695
Means nothing then that's what you think it no no no no there there must be more

296
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
Nobody can understand this sort of vocabulary

297
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
I was confused with explanation

298
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
Because way down at the bottom of the report in the final paragraph

299
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
The only thing they said about a possible cause was

300
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
And I quote

301
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
This phenomenon is extensively described in these specialized illiterate

302
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Yes we did right

303
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
And what were you referring to their

304
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Nothing in particular

305
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
What's this

306
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Why

307
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Did not

308
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Explain what

309
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Really happening

310
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,511
So Zoe went to her fellow parliamentarians and was like there was a

311
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Problem

312
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
We don't know what really happens like we got to look into this

313
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
What can we check

314
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Who can check

315
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
WeChat

316
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
But the people do older member of the parliament to say oh yeah she know she's

317
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Daryl

318
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Fringe

319
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,503
Style and she's speaking about problems basically

320
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Forget about

321
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,415
It's done we are elected election our girl there was no problem

322
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
But I said no no

323
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
We must find out what

324
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Where is really

325
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
The problems

326
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Unspeakable

327
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
So

328
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
Zoe contacted me and she did send me the paperwork

329
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Scary stories about to the guy named David

330
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Cologne

331
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
He is a member of a group called

332
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
And we are fighting for ethics into electronic voting

333
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
Against voting machine yes but interesting way he's also like a Hotshot ikigai works for the European Parliament

334
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Yeah and that's an IT people I tell you don't trust her

335
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
Don't put everything in or on for a long time you reached out and asked

336
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
Can you help me understand what are these random bitten versions like what is it called

337
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
I did computer science and bits are not flipping what are they talking about

338
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
So I needed to find out so I guess I started to

339
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
Google to ask what could explain the Articles or blog post

340
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
These are the things could always be traced back to some software bug

341
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
I'm eating something else totally satisfied comprised of new Search terms blah blah

342
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,527
Articles that made this strange claim

343
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Good shape

344
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
A bit of memory

345
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Wait what

346
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
They said yes

347
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
If the cosmic ray touch your computer the right way at the right spot

348
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
It could change

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
A bit

350
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
From zero to one

351
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Gamma rays

352
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Ain't that Belgium

353
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
In favor

354
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
I'm a particular Waterloo

355
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,663
We're not going to be able to use any of this statement

356
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
So you're saying that

357
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Created this effect

358
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
In Belgium on that day

359
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
Was a Zing from deep space

360
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
That was the theory

361
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
The David kmak

362
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
My

363
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,303
First reaction West

364
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
But then it became a bit

365
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
Pizza because I found out about

366
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
Is IBM IBM research

367
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Freeman's mind

368
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,127
IBM paper from the 70s

369
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
In in it

370
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
Electronic data processing center give me the latest news about random bit flipping and

371
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
Problem with computer memory

372
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
The report explain how in the 60s

373
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,511
NASA had noticed these random bit flips in their satellite

374
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
And then more recently how IBM itself Problems by the computer can be displayed and had studied their computers

375
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
At higher altitude so closer to

376
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
A space that's it

377
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Closer to the sky

378
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Closer to God

379
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,663
And I found out that they were more bit flipping

380
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Hope they're all down at the sea level

381
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
In the only explanation they could come up with for for what

382
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Be causing this

383
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Weather

384
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
With cosmic rays

385
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
Yes when they investigated they found out that it could have been cosmic rays causing problems

386
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Okay

387
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
Ghost cosmic rays essentially

388
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Charged particle

389
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Enso electronic systems

390
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
Can get affected by the way is Professor Bharat electrical

391
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,735
Jaringan computer science department Endwell brat wasn't involved in that specific IBM paper

392
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
He has essentially dedicated his life

393
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
To studying the effects

394
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
The cosmic rays

395
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
So we started noticing on the surface of the Earth this problem started around 2001

396
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
1 mm to time frame

397
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Recent

398
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
Right and they helped me get me

399
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,495
Is this a thing that people know about me is just like a first time I hear of it

400
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
I don't know if she should continue on this road go to the cosmic ray land

401
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
Narrative or do you want cosmic ray land

402
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
Oh I like I loved it that that's a choice

403
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Place where we get to decide

404
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
I am torn

405
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
Well I don't know it maybe

406
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415
I think we dive in that we get we give some

407
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
Okay okay okay

408
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
I said so according to bharath to understand what happened that day in Belgium

409
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
We have to go back to a long time ago

410
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Wait for it

411
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
In a galaxy far far away

412
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm going to General Life way too much

413
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
Is in the distant galaxies there was a very very old star

414
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:40,927
That exploded and went to star explode it sent out the huge amount of

415
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,255
Material all sorts of little tiny charged particle

416
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Discharge

417
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Thrown into space

418
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,959
And this particles are going to travel through space

419
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
For millions of light years

420
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Xiamen

421
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
These particles are passing through other galaxies they get disconnected they get prepped going or

422
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
Around songs by gravitational pull

423
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Until finally on May 18th

424
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
2003

425
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,871
One of these particles with lots and lots of energy

426
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
Entries are solar

427
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
And not long after that comes into the atmosphere

428
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
Ashes into an Earthly atmospheric Park

429
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
And in that moment

430
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:49,791
Energy transferred to most free particle potentially in hands off a little bit of energy

431
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Causing that newly energized atmospheric Mart

432
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
Just started heading towards Earth on its way down its Max into a couple other part

433
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,871
Passing some of that energy on again causing those particles to fall

434
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
And crashing other particle

435
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
And this happens again and again as the particles and the cosmic energy catapult towards the surface of the Earth

436
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,159
And stop you get this Kaskade it's a shower of all these particles

437
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
From the doorway to look like a Christmas tree

438
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Down at sea level

439
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Down on the surface

440
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Define discount

441
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Belgium

442
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Bose Electronics

443
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
System that was counting the world

444
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
In Belgium coming along humming along annoying its own way of telling the votes by

445
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Turning on those lights

446
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
The switch that turns on those light bulbs is called a transistor but then start turns on or off

447
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
And that creates

448
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
-31 + 0

449
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
When it's on it sends out a little bit of electricity switching on a bulb

450
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
But the thing is

451
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Different sisters can be tricked

452
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Into turning on

453
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
So imagine

454
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
Suddenly this particle from outer space

455
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
Come zooming down and enters that voting machine getting precisely the transistor that

456
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Troll that 13th bit

457
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
That instant the transistor is tricked and sends out a burst of electricity to that 13th

458
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
212 powder

459
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
And the bits

460
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Flipped

461
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Is 0 with change to A-1

462
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
And from the heavens

463
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
Does 4096 vote

464
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Appeared

465
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
What the hell

466
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Again David glow

467
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
I don't know I mean

468
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Like if I took both cosmic ray

469
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
O on one side

470
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
I'm afraid that people will

471
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
Take me for somebody crazy

472
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
But

473
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,416
You can read it too if you Google those words you will find a lot of

474
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
Scientific stuff talking about that

475
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
Inside out not long after David and Zoe met up

476
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
Anne and David told her what he'd found

477
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
That that is pause

478
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Who knows

479
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
That the vote was changed by the cops

480
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Isis

481
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Cosmic ray

482
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
Put down in the computer

483
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
And it's making me

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
It's not possible you are really sure

485
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,856
I've got no clue if that's the true explanation or not and there is no way to prove

486
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
That is a cosmic ray

487
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
But I mean it

488
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
The only thing which match their explanation

489
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
I will never can

490
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,168
Explain that in the party or going to laugh

491
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
Aware of all of this

492
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
At the next

493
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Session of Parliament

494
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
I just decided

495
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,320
To ask a question to the new minister

496
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Who was responsible for the election

497
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,440
Session gets underway

498
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
And eventually

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
The agenda turns design

500
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Nope there's no audio recording of this

501
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Possession but based on transcript

502
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
It went something like

503
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
She walked up to the podium at the front of the chamber

504
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
NBA

505
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,200
We should proceed alone but should be nice

506
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
She summarized but it happened in skarbek

507
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
And then explained what David had told

508
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Better

509
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Distr

510
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Which inversion

511
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Cayo Costa

512
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
Cosmic ray

513
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Coolest program in the computer

514
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
The the room was that joking hahaha

515
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
So you should know come here with

516
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
The little green man

517
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Dumb dumb

518
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
And the minister

519
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
You say yeah yeah poop worried was

520
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:57,600
Morrow are off somewhere but we see he has no problem with the results of the election

521
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Without the minister

522
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
Serta motion to move on

523
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
But before her time could expire

524
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,304
Avant

525
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Don't jump back in basically said

526
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Wait a second

527
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Think about what this could mean

528
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
If this is true like

529
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Can we trust these machines

530
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
So I asked

531
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Are you sure

532
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
There was no other

533
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
Cosmic rays somewhere

534
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,968
Change some of the results of the election

535
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
And the minister

536
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
After pausing for a moment

537
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Admit

538
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
You was not sure

539
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,328
And when the minister said yeah press the other problem we don't know

540
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
There was a strength silence

541
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,752
And nobody can't laugh anymore

542
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,152
Democracy and stars do not get along

543
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,480
Apparently Debbie dips efecto dingo dingo I think

544
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Someone here needs to hold the skepticism

545
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,184
I'll be scampi the skeptic what is what are the odds questions

546
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
And that this does happen

547
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
That that a cosmic ray can hit a computer and goofed

548
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
I mean

549
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
The only thing I can say is

550
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
I mean even a manual will concede that

551
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,752
Cosmic radiation can have an effect on electronic computers

552
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:24,128
And brats and his team have actually sympathized is happening this respect the mid flip

553
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
We will actually put the computer engineer accelerator

554
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
It's usually say cyclotrons which is basically this mini controlled supernova

555
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
I told magic to me but what they do within cyclotron bacon get you the.

556
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Is concrete bunker

557
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Point the particle beam added

558
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:49,472
Electronic systems working read drag all the wires out of the room blender few buttons to post

559
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
B21 the light comes on alarm sounds

560
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Meantime

561
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
It's called Beantown

562
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,624
They blast a computer with these tiny particles a million particles

563
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
Or II just like those cosmic rays flying through space

564
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,096
And as is happening Bharat says you can sit there and watch the big flips

565
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,448
And given this fact would so he was really asking was

566
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
If the

567
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Extrovert where I'm at

568
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Photos of 96

569
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
Small bit sleeping

570
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Then would you notice

571
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,528
Like what if a candidate just got 32 extra votes that invisibly changed and out

572
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
That that's the pot

573
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,696
It's only when the computer produce an impossible result

574
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
That you can tell

575
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
That day was something wrong

576
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
The tip of the iceberg

577
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
You want us to just throw the breaker do you guys want to come in and

578
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
Cintas is here what you do and then we'll come in and ruin it

579
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Classic

580
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,624
Music Flower music

581
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Buckle up

582
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:17,024
Can we come back we are driving full-steam ahead into that iceberg

583
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Figure out just how deep it goes

584
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
What an interesting metaphor that the mixture going to drive a car

585
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
You have to ask mrs. Vanderbilt your third grade teacher to go back to the

586
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,528
Weather for section of the lesson rate correct in the next hour

587
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

592
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:12,064
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

593
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

594
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,792
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

595
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Brilliance

596
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
Basically I want to hear about this

597
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
I kid you know did something

598
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
It just means you lean back and say whoa

599
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
How do they do that

600
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,128
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

601
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Back to you

602
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

603
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,672
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry

604
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
We're interested in the

605
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
Specific moments where

606
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,864
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

607
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168

612
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Thank you so much

613
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Hey Betty

614
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
Jad and Robert Radiolab

615
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
So I so we just heard that 8 is that a single

616
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Cosmic ray from deep space

617
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
Flipped a particular election result

618
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
I guess the next question is like you know why is this happening

619
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
All the time some of the I'm well if you mean like how often do those charged particles hit Earth

620
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
We are bombarded by this particle

621
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Quite often

622
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Is cosmic rays

623
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Back having the coming

624
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
Yep they're coming for you right now

625
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
Somebody you are getting thousands of these particles going through

626
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
What an animal inside a building you're still going to get all those particles cuz most of these particles

627
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,736
Cannot be stopped Pages go through anything and everything

628
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
So Pratt seems pretty sure of

629
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Yes yes

630
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
Simon Iver like weight

631
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
We got to see this

632
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
Parcels

633
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:32,352
Apparently Elder these particles are just too small to be seen with the naked eye

634
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,216
We are currently in the studio lacking the place out brought did tell us there's something we can build

635
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,592
Something called a cloud chamber with which is basically just an upside-down cup you filled with vapor

636
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
Yeah that might let us see the trails these particles leave behind

637
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,504
If you can make one that would be really really good

638
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Here's what you're going to need

639
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
Make your very own at home

640
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
Cloud chamber now it turns out there's a lot of YouTube videos showing you how to do this

641
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,840
Chamber 1 starting a kid who looks about 4 years old

642
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
Outer space

643
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,776
So we had a pretty good chance of making it work

644
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:18,176
We got dry ice cast iron pan on my kitchen flipped it over

645
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
The chunks of dry ice

646
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
The metal cooling down

647
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
Most beautiful

648
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
Hazing

649
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
A metal pan was singing

650
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Listen to

651
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Puretone

652
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
Shut up next

653
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,568
Take a see-through plastic cup 24 oz

654
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Friends

655
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
Had a little bit more red and purple

656
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:55,296
Thick adults in the bottom of the cup hold it in place with magnets on either side of the south magnets Chad

657
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,160
So that felt and rubbing alcohol pretty thoroughly soaked

658
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,976
Turn the cup upside down under the Nile very cold

659
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
Cast iron pan replace with modeling clay

660
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,144
Overhead lights off flashlight on Amite at the base of a cup

661
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
And then

662
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Wait let's watch for it

663
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
How is this thing going to work or what are we trying to see here

664
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
So what we're looking for what should happen

665
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,784
Is that that cold metal is going to make

666
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
The alcohol vapor

667
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Inside the cup condensed

668
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
And I turn into a cloud

669
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
Michigan to make a cloud

670
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Sissy

671
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
Tiny little particles shooting through and we won't be able to see the particle itself but we will be able to see the trail they leave behind

672
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,776
And it's supposed to be very similar to

673
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
The trail that an airplane leaves behind in this country

674
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,504
Contrail exactly so what so what we're going to see is he's like tiny little airplanes are tiny little contrails inside this

675
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Asbury Park

676
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Exactly

677
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
All three of us are on our knees in the studio

678
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,232
It's black at the moment the only light is emanating from a headlamp on the inside

679
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
But maybe it's one of those like

680
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
Watched pot never boils

681
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
Nothing happened I don't think there's enough fog in there

682
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Tomorrow

683
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
After about an hour of this

684
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
Halo around

685
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,952
Pulling up YouTube on our phones

686
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
Checkered scientific method to work via things to do

687
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
Okay

688
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
I see behind

689
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Just in case

690
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
Alone in the dark

691
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
The little beam of light

692
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
I thought one

693
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
Very very tiny white thin thin thread

694
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Materialize

695
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,456
They're there I'm seeing a bunch of offended in the cloud

696
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Holding a shape for just a moment

697
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,624
How do you spell disappearing

698
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,232
Oh well

699
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
We couldn't not see them

700
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,888
Film

701
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Three there

702
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
Doan's coming right through me

703
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
Okay I can now tell you not just because someone told me

704
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,208
Because I saw it for myself

705
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Things are definitely real

706
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
And there are definitely a lot of

707
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
So I guess the next obvious question is

708
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
You know they're here

709
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,472
Besides that voting booth in Belgium

710
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
Like what else are they messing with

711
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
Has my phone ever

712
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,664
Is the probability such that my phone has likely been

713
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Goof by a bit flip caused by a cosmic ray

714
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:42,368
Afternoon systems are getting big flakes on a daily basis

715
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
Okay

716
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
For example the routers

717
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,048
Let me hear when the internet hit parts of the internet get shut off by these things

718
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Yeah I routinely even today

719
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Whoa whoa whoa whoa down for five minutes

720
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Cisco Systems

721
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,336
They already keenly aware of this problem

722
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Apparently in the early 2000s

723
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,712
Google indexing system was down for 5 months

724
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Okay what what what else

725
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
It has been approved by the

726
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
Lord of manufacturing plants have been goof Bible

727
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,464
Really expensive custom manufacturing plant which made custom machine

728
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
And one of the bit

729
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
So they were making things

730
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
Wrong

731
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
What's a real example of that

732
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Not sure I can discuss what kind of

733
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Machine

734
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
Not sure

735
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Sorry something that the route was able to tell

736
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Is that the higher up you are in our atmosphere

737
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,488
The number of particles with higher energy is higher

738
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
And that means the chances of a bit flip

739
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:00,192
Are also Electronics in airplane is always bombarded

740
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,056
By this particle in one thing the plane is flying it's on autopilot

741
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,920
And suddenly one of the bit flips that takes it out of the autopilot

742
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Yeah

743
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
What airplane

744
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Where

745
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Transport site

746
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,368
Air flight

747
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
In about 2018 passenger

748
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,560
Send one crewman but was seriously injured when the Qantas Airbus noise.

749
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,120
Plummeting more than a thousand space

750
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
She's essentially dropped like a rock and it was all because of a one bit flipping weights

751
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Caused by a cosmic

752
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Wait it's just

753
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,200
Beaches nosedive 4015 people like Hitler had just turned off and have nobody

754
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Oh my God

755
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Because of a bit

756
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,648
Holy s*** now we should say that like even though bit flips are happening frequently

757
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
The vast majority of those flips

758
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,816
Behr midnight we don't even notice them flipping only Eve

759
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
It's right there in the right position

760
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
So for example in the Parliament that beat

761
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,800
Deadbeat flip method only if they were taking a wart at the time

762
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:14,176
And actually telling the world so the likelihood of a backflip having any consequence at all

763
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
Rare

764
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Okay

765
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:25,696
Hello this message is for either Grover or Barbara

766
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
The strange call to receive I'm sure even crazier

767
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
Want to reduce my credit card interest or

768
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,336
Get me something for my pain this is Barbara Walton we reached her in Boiling Springs North

769
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,712
South Carolina one stop light town where she lives with her husband growth we've been here since

770
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:53,088
We got married 53 years ago

771
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
In one of those cars my gosh

772
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
Do you mind is just like telling me what you were doing the morning of the accident we live in North Carolina

773
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
We have a son that lives on the coast and South Carolina so we were going to visit to put a 4 and 1/2 hour drive

774
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
See through some pretty good-sized towns area we were in was more or less a rural area

775
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
2008 Prius Grover is behind the wheel in the back seat because I was on my computer and I didn't like to do that in

776
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,952
In the front seat because of the possibility of the airbag coming out and throwing the computer my face

777
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
I can ask what were you doing on your computer in the backseat

778
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Probably solitaire

779
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,144
Something to occupy my time I usually

780
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Snooze Orpheum

781
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,496
We've made that trip many times so I've seen the

782
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Scenery

783
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
For the first three and a half hours at the drive

784
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Everything is totally normal

785
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,200
Grover calmly at the wheel driver on a laptop

786
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
And then

787
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,856
Barbara looks up from a computer if my husband is speeding

788
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
And I I said are you doing

789
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
He said I can't slow down

790
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
And

791
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,240
I said will you have to play that he said I'm applying the brake it is not slowing down

792
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,688
When how did you guys remember exactly how fast you were going better judge of that than I would

793
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
When are when are car

794
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
Ran away with us

795
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
How fast would you say the car was going

796
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
I'm sure it was more than that

797
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,192
He's saying 65 I'm saying 6570

798
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
I can imagine feeling like

799
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Really panics

800
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
Mr. Walton does

801
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Panic mrs. Walton

802
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
I am freaking out

803
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:04,159
At this point in the Drive-Thru on a two-lane highway coming through a huge Wetland area so I'm both sides it's just swamp

804
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
In water

805
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
And

806
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:13,119
I didn't want to go down into the swamp husband the driver

807
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Break

808
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,239
It's quick as I took my foot off the brake it was start

809
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Accelerate being again I finally just basically stood on the

810
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Break

811
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:29,503
The way they describe that it was almost like one of those Hollywood movies where you're like

812
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Creating them Highway we are not slowing down dipping by car seat belts on in and out of traffic

813
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Computers

814
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,767
Praying that this was going to turn out alright

815
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,191
4 somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes

816
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
Grover fought

817
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
With the car. I can't remember if

818
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
How how did you stop

819
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
I know we cross that swampy Bridge

820
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Award

821
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
Brake pads and the rotor

822
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
Okay so that's what stopped

823
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,343
By just applying the brakes so long and

824
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
It's so hard

825
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
It wore the brakes on the road around that's how

826
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
The car finally came to a

827
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,327
They called her son who did some quick research online and apparently there were already

828
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,983
Complaint

829
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Find in a toilet

830
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
Turned out all over the country

831
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,759
Silver a 100-foot cliff

832
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,343
Toyota cars Toyota trucks there Toyota

833
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
I remember this is abuse with a new story

834
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
From the driver point of view what was happening

835
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
Was that the car would take off

836
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
Sometimes at low speeds but sometimes at high speed

837
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
And the drivers would say

838
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,263
My foot was on the brake pedal but my car kept going faster

839
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,663
This is still coatman he's a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and co-founder of edge case research

840
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
Am I special to you for all these years

841
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:10,623
Fault tolerant Computing and Phil told us that around the same time he's accidents started happening in the early 2000s

842
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,927
Was the same time that Toyota cars

843
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
All cars really

844
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
We're starting to become computerized

845
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,863
That's right before this moment cars are mostly mechanical and you feel like you don't pop the hood

846
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,191
Basically figure out what was going on but after this moment it's

847
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
Mostly computers

848
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,287
And not just me engine your car has

849
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,127
Dozens or in some cases more than a hundred little boxes

850
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,967
DELL Electronics inside it has small small books

851
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,319
Like a paperback book in the wall and floor and ceiling of the

852
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
The car wherever they can find

853
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:45,951
They do all sorts of little things you take out your keys in your press the button and your doors unlock

854
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,511
There's a computer inside that key

855
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
Sending a message

856
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
To a computer inside the

857
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
The car telling the computer at the Lock to open the lock 3 computers are conversing about that unlocking moment

858
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
At least

859
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
In the responsible for some

860
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Pretty important thing

861
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,127
Things like now when you press the gas pedal

862
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
I instead of it being this direct physical link

863
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
To the throttle

864
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,063
Make the car go that pedal is now basically just an input

865
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Computer why do they want to do that

866
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,463
What you can get better fuel economy you know it's a it's a more pleasant Drive

867
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,535
So that part is great it's a better driver experience but

868
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
You just trusted your life

869
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
2 software

870
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
And that's a new thing

871
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
Was that talked about or known or was this sort of a silent transition that you as the driver would never really know unless

872
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
You looked it up in Popular Mechanics

873
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
I don't think that you would probably have known as regular driver

874
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,015
And so when this whole thing broke because most people didn't know that their cars were now

875
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,551
Computers and because most

876
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,183
The victims were on the older side

877
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,999
People

878
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,327
Barbara says when they took the car to the Toyota dealership I'll never

879
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Forget

880
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
This

881
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Market

882
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
Grin he had on his

883
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Face

884
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,775
Telling us he didn't find anything wrong

885
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
With the car

886
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,871
If you're on the car company side you say so you press

887
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
The pedal and it kept going faster which pedal does that

888
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
Damn I've been driving since I was 15

889
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:21,439
What is a difference in the accelerator and Brake

890
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Weather radar

891
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,327
Until August 20th 2009

892
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:34,495
911 call came from a passenger of a Lexus Toyota

893
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Okay

894
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,375
You don't have the ability to like rental vehicle

895
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Not one of the four people in that

896
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Car survived

897
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
The 45 year old

898
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,951
Male California highway patrol officer Mark Saylor who Specialties vehicle inspector

899
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
A10 dead this guy can't stop

900
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Best car

901
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,839
Just broke that driver error narrative

902
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:38,239
Toyota has a problem pieces and so that's what launched all the inquiries in the recall

903
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,383
Tarzan finds Toyota settled huge 1.6 billion dollar lawsuit

904
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,223
Bass car without admitting any blame but after that

905
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
2000 reported cases are federal criminal investigation into Rising 289

906
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,463
People accuse you of 500 death and injury cases

907
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
Started to form

908
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
And when the experts

909
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,095
Still being one of them giving full access

910
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,447
Do Toyota's software and Hardware they found a number of things wrong

911
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
But the key in all of this

912
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Was

913
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,895
You guessed it if you had a bit flip the test that controls the throttle position could die

914
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
Causing it to stick

915
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,223
In some open position that would happen

916
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
They reproduce that on a car willing in in the first of those

917
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
Death and injury cases what

918
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
What happened

919
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
The tree said that they

920
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
But I have to make sure I only say things I'm allowed to say

921
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:36,351
Actually big deal after

922
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
I wanted the experts

923
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
African time

924
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
So you have to be careful

925
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
Wow okay

926
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,775
Start

927
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
The jury found

928
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
That

929
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
Toyota was liable

930
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
For the Deaf

931
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,247
And the only Theory presented in the case was that the computer

932
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Kill people

933
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
A temperature agreed

934
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,951
Toyota settle that case immediately and begin to settle all 500 other cases in the queue

935
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
Hey everybody let's not drag this thing out and put it through

936
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:09,119
The public I can't speculate as to the motive spend right I think the facts speak for themselves

937
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
God humming this is

938
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,751
Yeah and I'm like one quick crazy side.

939
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:19,871
Is ruling actually led to the freedom of a Minnesota man named cool if only

940
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
We already spent

941
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
Two and a half years in prison

942
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,063
Charged with vehicular homicide for killing three people in an in the Toyota he was driving when it suddenly

943
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,879
Control ruling like

944
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,719
I got the sky to prison but he was in prison for 2 and 1/2 years

945
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Do you know

946
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Is acceleration

947
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
That's not enough

948
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
Winfred like in your opinion and your experience

949
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
Do you think this specific case and other cases were in fact caused by Justice

950
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Frazee

951
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Cosmic chain of events that led to

952
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
A tiny little bit of electricity

953
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
Grazing

954
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
A circuit board

955
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
As amazing as it sounds

956
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:04,415
These type of events are almost certainly caused by that now was that the primary

957
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,463
Contribution to the toilet

958
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
I don't know and

959
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Probably no one will ever know

960
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:22,591
I think the way you're painting the world almost as looks like it they're just smoking wrecks everywhere they crashed

961
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Planes and

962
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:28,991
Tarzan 2 light poles and the internet's not working it how are we

963
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
How are you functioning

964
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:37,183
We went back and we started fixing the prompts

965
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,815
Once we know that autopilot is the one that's causing the problem been respect

966
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:48,959
How do you fix it so you get three copies of everything the same electronic system that three of them

967
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:54,079
And at least two of them have to agree to do anything

968
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Smart

969
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
So today like tripling and doubling redundancy is a norm and planes and cars with any other life

970
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Trending technology

971
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,647
And actually the same thing was done in skarbek at after that incident in 2003

972
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
So now when they haven't

973
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
Election vote is actually counted twice by the

974
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:16,607
One of the tallies doesn't match the other that they know something's gone wrong and media

975
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
So that's cool

976
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
But here's the thing

977
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,007
Is doubling and tripling is just too expensive to do with mosto

978
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Thanks

979
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:30,175
And as our Electronics gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller

980
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
Just going to happen more and more

981
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
Why would that be

982
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:39,391
The smaller the transistor the less energy you need to flip that bit

983
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
I need the housing electrons

984
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:46,047
30% of 1 or 0 how many electrons did you need back in the 70s

985
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
I'll probably million

986
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
Oh and now you just

987
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
And transistors made today

988
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
I like

989
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Tiny Thai

990
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,079
Your hair is 50 Micron in diameter so take your hair

991
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Inflated thousand times

992
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,455
So that gets you down to 15 m

993
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
And we are looking at 7

994
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,111
So you want some pretty much slices down 7 more times

995
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
And what you are left with

996
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,487
Easter size of transistors that are coming

997
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,767
In the market

998
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
In the neck

999
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
2 years

1000
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,375
Baby in cell phones and laptops and things like that

1001
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
They would be everywhere

1002
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:33,407
Show as we get better and better and better than miniaturizing our technology

1003
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,711
You're more and more and more

1004
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,759
At risk to these tiny flying

1005
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
Through our technological advancement

1006
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
We have invited this problem upon herself

1007
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:49,023
That is one way to look at it did you go back to those big cell phone

1008
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,095
Being 5 kg each

1009
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
Footlong

1010
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,167
Then you won't hear this

1011
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,495
Thanks Annie Simon

1012
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,287
Yeah actually have one more thing

1013
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Sure

1014
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,455
Well we've been doing some research into this and we talked to a bunch of electrical engineers

1015
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
And this is going to sound very very strange

1016
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,599
But what these researchers are saying

1017
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
A likely cause

1018
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Was

1019
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,767
A cosmic ray hitting one of the computers could cause

1020
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,375
At the driver to lose the ability to control the gas

1021
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
Oh my Lord

1022
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,055
Well I am not a scientist

1023
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Sick person

1024
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
Anything's possible

1025
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,735
Now you're saying we're bombarded by cosmic rays all the time

1026
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,319
If that's so perhaps

1027
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
Maybe we just

1028
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,927
Maybe we just got baptized

1029
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:26,047
Do you think Grover would be if I'm just curious to hear his reaction to the possibility

1030
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,887
Your car accelerated because of cosmic ray hit

1031
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
What is he think about that

1032
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
There is one

1033
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:38,847
Siri said an engineer came up with that there

1034
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Engineer's hat

1035
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Come up with us

1036
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Siri

1037
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
You know we're bombarded with

1038
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
Cosmic rays all the time

1039
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
What's Cosmo

1040
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
Raise all the

1041
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
What time

1042
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
And it's possible

1043
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
That a cosmic ray

1044
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
If it hit

1045
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,231
Just at the right time in the right place

1046
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
On board

1047
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
Shooters and

1048
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
Possibly that

1049
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Accelerator

1050
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
He wants to know how you

1051
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
I feel about that

1052
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
I'm so bored open-minded but

1053
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,223
At this point in time

1054
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
You know I question that but

1055
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
It's not that big a deal

1056
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:22,879
Okay

1057
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Alyssa

1058
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
It's home and

1059

White one time

1060
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,775
Well we couldn't agree more and so what we've decided to do

1061
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:43,615
Is provide you with a small entertainment for you to sip your white wine with

1062
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407

Watch it's very short

1068
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903

Yeah I think so

1076
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
I feel real

1077
