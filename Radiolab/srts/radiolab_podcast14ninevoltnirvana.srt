1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,240
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Radiolab

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,152
From WNYC

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
And NPR

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,576
Is Radiolab a I'm Jedi from rod iron Robert krulwich I'm Soren wheeler

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
And this

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,560
Do you want to say that okay

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
And I didn't hear anyone can I hear anyone oh my God

10
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
She's a

11
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:50,176
Old friend of mine went to school together long time ago but these days she's an editor at New Scientist

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,504
In London because of

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
What happened to her when she was working on

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Story for them this was a story that I've been chasing for years and years for her in 2007

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
At DARPA Tech

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Which is a big Gathering of like weapons developers and researchers it's like 5000

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
It's from The Matrix you know looking at the

18
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
The latest war toys drones Bazookas anyway at some point she starts talking to this woman and she was telling me about

19
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,456
Her program which was that they had figured out how to apply for electrical current

20
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
To the brain in order to

21
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
Accelerate the learning process

22
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
I was like no sweat Sally it stumbled into a something called PDC

23
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
DS games for transcranial Direct

24
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
Current stimulation

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Daddy is

26
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
You take a couple little

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Electrodes are placed on your scalp connected with wires to a battery you send a little bit of electricity into your brain and

28
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Then

29
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
All kinds of things happen

30
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
If you believe the claims

31
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
But

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
Porcelli started with a casual afternoon of

33
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Sniper training

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
So after that

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
Conversation with a conference she tracked down a group in Carlsbad California

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,488
About an hour and a half south of La using this brain zapping stuff to train snipers

37
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
And I actually got new scientist agreed send me to LA from London which is not an insignificant

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Expense after a late night international flight in some LA traffic

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
Stuff at a place called Advanced Brain Monitoring

40
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Where they have

41
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,480
Little room little room where they set up a little sort of

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,576
360 degree training simulation to kind of like a video game

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
But it's like the full

44
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Kind of like the full room in front of you

45
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
And so wall is a screen

46
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,584
Yes. She says but all around you in this room are these

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Props your behind real sandbags

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
You know in proper position they teach you how to hold the rifle properly and rifled except for the fact that it shoots blanks is basically the

49
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Real deal yeah and then Scott a laser

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Laser sight they told you know

51
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
Okay before we do this brain stimulation thing we're actually going to have you

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
You do some training without it so they

53
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,368
Get her all set up they put her behind the sandbags and they hit cup

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
It starts out with really easy stuff like you're shooting virtual Target that aren't

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Kickback from the CO2 cartridge and then you get this like sound from when you hit you know the virtual metal Target and then it starts getting hot

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Carter so there's people instead of targets and and more and more people until the highest level is you are at at

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Point Rocky checkpoint and everything's fine and then all sudden

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Humvee in front of you blows up and then from all over the place up dozens of people in suicide

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Start running at you with air rifle shooting you and I'm just

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Being blown

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Stop I can't

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
I can't make the decisions fast enough or just too many of them she couldn't figure out who to shoot first it was so

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm so tired and I'm so jet-lagged and I was so bad at it and it's funny because you think like or whatever

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
What's the video game

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
It's amazing how

66
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
Stress ball that gets in a certain point

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Stress

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Started getting

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,440
Stop let's just end this start thinking like

70
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,327
How am I doing here anyway like oh my God this is going to be a story and really you just flew out to California for the

71
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
She was not very good at in that kind of stressed her out and then this guy walked in the room

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Yes likewise

73
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Mike weisend neuroscience

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
It looks like Gregg Allman

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,407
Super long hair and fairly clean cut at the moment but I had hair down to my belt buckle

76
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Mike weisend has put together this

77
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
Contraption what is the big boxes sitting in your lap

78
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
There's a big red

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,207
Tool box that we got literally from Sears Mike was actually passing through New York city so we invited him into the studio

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
We have electrodes

81
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,375
That allows to deliver current you legit wires a song and a whole bunch of batter

82
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
So we take

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
A set of electrodes one electrode is attached

84
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
2 mi

85
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Right

86
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Temple

87
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,639
And the other electrode is attached by different wire to my

88
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Left

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
Darned we turn on the juice

90
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Did it hurt it wasn't so much that I suddenly tasted metal in my mouth tasted tasted like I'd like to

91
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,255
The inside of an aluminum can and then he's like

92
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
I'm not exactly expecting different results

93
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Today's date

94
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,703
Start me out again right at the really hard checkpoint 1 the thing blows up

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
And then people start coming from all over the place

96
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
And I feel like they must have put it on an easy setting

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,063
Everything is just a little more straightforward it's more obvious who I should pick off first

98
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
And I'm thinking to myself a little bit like

99
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
You know when it's going to get really hard again

100
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
And then

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
You know intern or whoever comes in and turns on the lights

102
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
She's like okay you're done Michael wait

103
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
That's not that's not

104
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
I've only been here for like 3 minutes

105
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
That was 20 minutes

106
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,103
Like no that's not true and I look up in the clocks of all shifted by 20 minutes

107
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
And I swear to God it was 3 minutes almost every person that would put this on so they get into what they call us

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
State of

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Hello

110
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
Where they don't recognize of the time is going by there just boom boom boom boom

111
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
And I was like did you guys make it easier Stellino same

112
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Same level

113
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
I think you guys made it easier when Sally did it with

114
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Brain stimulation

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
She performed at 100%

116
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
100%

117
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
I didn't leave anyone alive

118
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
How what was she before

119
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,199
I don't know but she wasn't very good at roughly 3 out of 20 of the first time in

120
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
20th 20th

121
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Yeah

122
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
So you're saying with just a little electricity she went from being like totally an app to

123
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Train killer

124
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Mountain end of one so we can't go too far but I mean this was just Sally's experience during this one.

125
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Sound like a controlled study

126
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
But Mike has now use this device in a bunch of studies

127
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,543
Military had one city with people looking at those black and white

128
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Radar in

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Trying to pick out you know

130
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:17,247
What's an enemy vehicle and what isn't and if he puts this device on their head while they're trying to learn how to

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
To do that we can double the rate of learning

132
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Really

133
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Wow what is it doing

134
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
Okay so what I think is that early on when you are learning Something Mike says that when you're trying to learn how to do something is kind of

135
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
What's happening is that your

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Trying a bunch of different things

137
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
You try all kinds of different ways to solve the problem

138
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
And

139
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
He usually your brain is stumbling across

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Ideal

141
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,663
Sequence of neurons every so often as you're practicing all sent your brain is like

142
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Okay that's it

143
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
But then it struggles to find that again it keeps messing up and whatever and if you look at an expert brain you actually see

144
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,975
See that preferred circuit dialed in

145
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Like they just do that over and over and over again no more stumbling around until what mic does he figured out

146
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,239
Where that circuit is and he gives it a little extra

147
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Juice to an innocent

148
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Prime the pump

149
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
So that that expert circuit

150
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
Is more likely to fire

151
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,783
And you're more likely to stumble into it and when you do stumble into it you're more likely to stick with it that's right

152
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
That's how

153
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
We think it works

154
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,695
Where are you are you sure what you're hitting I mean like you're putting electricity on the outs

155
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Side of

156
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
People's heads

157
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Are you able to Target

158
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Just a small cluster of brain cells or

159
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Is it a region that you're hitting or like

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
Thousand cell phone number

161
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
That's out that's a lot

162
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Is that precise enough

163
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
2

164
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
To Target

165
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
The place where a task is being done in a brain If it's a million

166
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
An artwork yes

167
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:00,159
Am I claims that even though it's a blunt tool this is not a scalpel this is a sledgehammer

168
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
If you know the right

169
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
Group of neurons are region of the brain to Target

170
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
This can work with almost any task

171
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
If you want to Target

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,703
Visual-spatial learning for example searching an image

173
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
You put this on the right

174
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Decide

175
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Of your head roughly near the temple

176
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
But if you wanted to learn text you on material you can put this on the left

177
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Side of your head and it will have a similar effect

178
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
Do you want to learn text from here Beach

179
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,647
If I'm if I want to learn irregular verbs in French

180
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,791
I keep getting your things I stick another part of my hair but as good of a grammar we haven't tested it with learning for inline

181
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,887
Languages for native English speakers learning a long English Center

182
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
They can recall it with greater fidelity

183
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
If they have this on their head while they

184
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Study listen

185
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
And if you go right parietal

186
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Back over

187
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Just behind your ear and up above your ear

188
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
You can learn math better

189
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
We are all kind of like

190
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
I don't know

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
But since my cat has a vice there with him should we try it

192
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,695
Sure I'm ready.

193
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
I mean Robert actually pretended he had an appointment I left

194
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Viniq

195
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Take me to the team here

196
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
I don't do fear

197
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Yeah you should be

198
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,615
Stick around because we're going to put electricity right into the man's hat I'm talking about

199
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,095
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

200
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
And I'm here because I need your help

201
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
And I request

202
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

203
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
About what we're calling

204
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Brilliance

205
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,319
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

206
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,671
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

207
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,535
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

208
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
To you

209
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

210
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

211
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

212
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

213
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Have anything to do with it

214
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
If you have a story

215
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
T-shirt with us

216
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
Go to radiolab.org

217
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Brilliance

218
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Record short audio message for us

219
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

220
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Thank you so much

221
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,151
Alright so you've got here in front of me you have two little circles

222
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Electrostatic

223
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Red wires and

224
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Black wax I get two of these on my head

225
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
One on your

226
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Upper arm one of my

227
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
For the demo

228
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Mike showed me a bunch of stereo

229
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Alright so what am I doing here I'm looking at a bunch of

230
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Marbles annoying

231
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,703
Where are you staring at this 2D picture of like

232
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Repeating pattern the marbles

233
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Or something

234
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
You supposed to unfocus your eyes and just the right way so that

235
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
3D picture

236
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
What's a mountain merge from background

237
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Yeah

238
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Take me my eyes go bad

239
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,831
So the idea that stem I was like let's see if I can train my eyes to

240
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Figure out how to

241
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Cool 3D pictures

242
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Is it

243
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
I've never

244
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
I get headaches when I go to 3D movies and it took me like 10 minutes

245
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
To get one

246
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
As a butterfly there you

247
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Stussy like just

248
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Look at that

249
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Alright so now you can choose me

250
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Alright I'm going to turn it on

251
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Okay

252
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah okay there it is

253
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,623
Weather feel like feels like a bunch of mosquitoes are biting me in my temple

254
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
It's love

255
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
And I could taste it now too

256
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
The people get that

257
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,887
Alright so now I'm going to I'm going to look at the stereoscopic images one more time here we are we've got a green and pink whoa

258
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
That just became the world

259
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
That

260
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Suddenly a 3D globe

261
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Pops out of the back row

262
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Okay

263
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Next one

264
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
Alright so now I'm looking at a big green grass

265
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Blades of grass repeating repeating repeating

266
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Pepsi

267
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Swan

268
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Swans origami swans

269
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
3D swans

270
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,279
Now I'm looking at a good set of a Trippy Paisley background and Sandy

271
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
3D Bambi

272
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Next one

273
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,703
Right now we have flower background to the yellow and pink flower Thailand background whoa

274
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Foxes foxes floating in space next

275
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Whoa

276
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
A little ballerina doing a handstand on the balance beam

277
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
Will Hershey's Kisses popping right now it's coming out really fast big pretzel

278
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Coiled snake

279
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Wow

280
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
That's what it feels

281
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Okay

282
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
I definitely felt like I could you couldn't give them to me fast enough

283
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
I feel very

284
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Very awake

285
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Okay so in the end I ended up being something

286
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
50 stereogram

287
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
They're really short

288
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
So I didn't think something was going on by

289
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Adriana Cimino

290
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Skeptical

291
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
You skeptical even when you were

292
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Flying free

293
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
I don't entirely trust experience I had cuz it could simply be like

294
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
Placebo could you drenalin I don't know

295
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Yeah I mean that's the thing is I just

296
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
No matter what it just seems like

297
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
The next

298
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Flavor of new age

299
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Think so

300
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
Started calling around my name is Peter Reiner and I'm professor at the University of British Columbia

301
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
So

302
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
So Peter actually

303
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Studies this whole field

304
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,503
Keep WhatsApp public perception in the quality of research and I just

305
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Basically asked aminos

306
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
For real like if you have a healthy brain you put a little

307
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,719
Electricity into a has it been proven that that will enhance learning or whatever else they claim

308
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Well

309
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Maybe the best way to answer that it is that

310
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
Part of the reason that there is all this interests

311
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Set tdcs

312
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Christy Ralph

313
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Effective

314
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Because this is based on a lot of different studies in a lot of different areas such a key to what I just said is relative

315
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,199
So the caveat that I have to add is that

316
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Much all of the studies

317
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
That have been done today.

318
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Relatively small

319
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
He says it's

320
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
Early days in the studies have been done have only been done with a few such a

321
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Maybe 20 people

322
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Larger study

323
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
40 or 50

324
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,375
Now these days to find a positive effect but if you're a hard-nosed scientist

325
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
You know those small sample sizes Aren't Enough

326
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
To make a very big claim

327
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Even so

328
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Cats

329
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
Kind of already out of the bag cuz if you go on YouTube

330
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Really brief

331
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Really quick

332
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
It's cool you can find a surprisingly large number of videos of

333
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
People experimenting with these devices

334
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
I instantly feel very

335
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Good

336
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Very

337
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Converse

338
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
Saying it's not really worried about anyting videos show you how to make your own

339
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,263
Diagram go to RadioShack by few simple parts

340
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
That's going to be your 9 volt

341
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
Alligator clips since I don't have any starter with me although I have a switch in the circuit YouTube Jessie

342
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Be filled with people who are trying to hotwire their own brain

343
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Howard Zinn

344
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
I have probably below average rainfall compared to normal people

345
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
I want

346
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
Starting your Sciences but as many of you I don't have the resources to go to school right now

347
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
To do is I like to use tdcs

348
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
While I'm learning my

349
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,591
Vocabulary list I want to give you an update on

350
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
How to learn a foreign language

351
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Which people are using this

352
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Thanksgiving how flexible

353
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
That's Nick fits he works with Peter Runner the guy we talked to her earlier and he says not only can you do a lot of different kinds of things

354
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
This device on top of that

355
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Dirt cheap

356
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,767
The time that it takes me to listen to one of your episodes

357
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
I can probably go to the store

358
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,119
Come back and build a tdcs device around $20

359
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
$20

360
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,751
I said something that makes you nervous

361
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,335
I'll say first I think the DIY Community is quite

362
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,967
But it does make me nervous that some people react report loss of consciousness after using it

363
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Healing Burns

364
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
There's actually one report of somebody going temporarily blind

365
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,767
This guy on YouTube young Asian kid wear

366
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,631
Where which places are my head would improve memory about how he spent a year Canada

367
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
Experimenting with it he put it in one place and after about 5 minutes

368
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
I started to really like really angry and depressed

369
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Put in another place

370
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
Tellagami a really high score on Lumosity

371
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
And I've only been stimulating my brain

372
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
It's like he's playing Russian roulette with

373
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Which brings up a larger point you know that

374
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Lit devices

375
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Possibly hard to regulate

376
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,255
The kid like this can put it anywhere he wants in his head and if he moves it just a couple of inches

377
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
It could have a

378
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,607
Drastically different effect and that's really what

379
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Is a

380
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Because according to Peter Reiner

381
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Well we might like to think of the brain as

382
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Was being a bunch of separate

383
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Circus

384
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Except

385
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Tasks

386
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Really

387
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
It's a Neko

388
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
Every part affects every other part

389
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,343
In some way and when you put your electrodes on head

390
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,743
You affecting serious small area of the brain right under the electrodes but it's already been shown that

391
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
That's perfect can bed multiply and spread throughout the nervous system even down to your spinal

392
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,031
There's a theory out there is called the zero-sum theory of the brain that some people use

393
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
Framework for thinking about all this which is like

394
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,199
No one part goes up another part goes like there's only so much juice in the brain so if you

395
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Send juice One Direction there's less juice somewhere else and a su then if you were enhancing one part year by definition

396
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Diminishing another

397
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
Maybe be honest it was definitely in After Effects

398
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Kind of why

399
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
I ended up talking to Sally about

400
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
This why I got so interested in this

401
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
He's in the first place

402
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
This is because

403
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
What happened to her

404
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
After the snap

405
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
For training so

406
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
Driving down from LA to Carlsbad

407
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Citgo

408
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Do this

409
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
Was an absolute nightmare I hadn't driven in like a year cuz I've been living in London where I just do public transportation

410
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
But on the way up

411
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
It's kind of like

412
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
Negative compared to Mario Kart but it's

413
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Extremely pleasant experience

414
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
I feel like I drove better that day than I ever drove before

415
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
I think it was very obvious where I

416
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Capaz people without

417
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
Irritating them and I don't know it's a weird

418
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
The weird memory but I think I had more fun driving

419
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
That day than I ever did

420
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Since

421
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
And some point she realized it wasn't just about her driving a bit

422
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
So

423
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
I would say that

424
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
I mean I don't know how much I want to get into sort of in public on the radio

425
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
About

426
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
You know being a bit anxious

427
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
I guess that's not particularly controversial

428
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Probably all writers

429
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
Liquor should have riddled with anxiety but you know I have

430
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
This

431
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Constant

432
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Struggle with all the little

433
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Angry gnomes in my head

434
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,151
You know populating my head and telling me I like all the things that I don't do right

435
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
You know all the things that I've done wrong that day they

436
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Keep this incredibly like

437
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
Comprehensive Taliesin

438
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
And then you know if they want to worry about the future than you know the ones who tell me I'm going to be living in a cardboard box

439
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
I mean it's just like an amazing

440
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Cacophony

441
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
But she says

442
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,888
Sitting in that car they were they were just completely turned off I think

443
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
For a couple of days

444
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
And it was a really

445
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
For a couple days or couple of days and to tell you the truth

446
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
It's kind of like everything just

447
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
I was just this

448
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
Person that I hadn't

449
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Experience before and I thought

450
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,576
Actual start of core person who I am

451
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
When all my baggage isn't just

452
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
It was like somebody had died

453
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
What's a really steamy window

454
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
Able to look at the world for what it was

455
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Curious weather like

456
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
There's a connection there that like

457
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Good

458
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Former

459
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Goes along with shutting down

460
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
The parts of yourself that say I don't know I don't think maybe I can't

461
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Maybe I shouldn't

462
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,464
And that's like there's actually a real connection between

463
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,280
Amping up one and tamping down the other

464
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,376
Makes sense if you take giving one circuit more power you might be taken away from other place

465
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,008
It's funny I mean it does I find this like you know since you and I are just been on stage

466
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
One of the things I struggle with most

467
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,432
During the performances has been sitting there with busting there we've got our Scripts

468
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
And I have the

469
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Box of buttons and afternoon which buttons

470
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
What things and there's like the musician.

471
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
Restaurant where they come in and out

472
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
And all of these things

473
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
They become competing voices

474
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
They become visible

475
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Shattering

476
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Gnomes the Sally pussy

477
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
State of my head

478
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,608
What is a Hellcat Network when does that come in where are we

479
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
Come on

480
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
Why you keep doing and I get like kind of crazy

481
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
So I can't actually even focus

482
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
What you're saying

483
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,224
It's not a good feeling and then there are other times where something happens almost like a mode

484
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
And suddenly it's like

485
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
Right there I know I'm right with you

486
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,696
It's the easiest thing in the world to listen to what you're saying and respond instinctively and in the moment

487
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
And it literally feel like different

488
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
Chemical mode

489
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Maybe electrical mode

490
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
You know what I mean

491
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
That's really that's

492
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
That's very

493
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
Maybe cuz I'm going back to the performance stuff

494
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
You can't really

495
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Make it

496
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
Happen I mean I guess

497
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
You could expose but it

498
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
It doesn't feel that way it feels like

499
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
It somehow feels like it's a gift

500
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
You know

501
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Like

502
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
Oh thank you universe

503
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
I feel really awake

504
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Present right now

505
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Thank you

506
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,184
What happens when it's an expectation

507
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
You know what happened to her

508
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Are the way in which we move to the world

509
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
If we can just

510
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
If we can create that on demand in order it up

511
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,704
Yeah gif

512
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Versus ordering it up

513
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:18,176
Is priceless pretty deep to me I mean I don't I feel like in a world where you order things out than you're in a

514
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
The world where you think you deserve things are you think you've earned them or you think other people have an agree with that completely.

515
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
It's a word that's a world that's empty of

516
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
True gratitude

517
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
To tell you the truth

518
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Worrying things

519
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Tumi

520
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Was

521
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Afterward how

522
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
How much I

523
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Craved

524
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Doing it again

525
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
It felt like a drug with no side effects

526
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
I mean I don't know if I'm

527
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
Can I get addicted to electricity

528
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Unlikely

529
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,464
Got to get some shoplifting batteries

530
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
Supermarket Corner licking

531
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
Thank you sir in no problem and thanks a lot to salieri
