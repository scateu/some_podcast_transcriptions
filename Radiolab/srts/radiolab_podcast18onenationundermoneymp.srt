1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you weightless

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Robert

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,136
Alright Robert season 2 finale

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,160
More perfect

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
Long overdue

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,488
But much-anticipated maybe

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,584
Among those who care

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
Want want to know

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,472
Give me a Mother's Day today and see how it it's it's Tuesday it's Tuesday

11
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
MRSA Tuesday

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
I guess I want to bring you a story from the more perfect

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
The final story of seasons

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
This story fulfill the promise I made to myself

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,712
The very beginning

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh my God

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,624
This question of yours isn't that old and that deep 22 years old

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
Sexy girls what the question is

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Their eyeballs will be rubbed I don't know what was it two years ago that stuck you

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
At the quest you've never been able to let go

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
My first question I bumped into and learning by the Supreme Court

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Was why does everybody keep talking about this thing called Commerce Clause

23
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,576
The Commerce

24
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Yes that had a Dazzle for you

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
No I just wanted to know what the hell is it well

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,536
It's Article 1 Section 8 Clause 3 of The Constitution 16 words

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,608
Two commas Congress shall have the power to regulate

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
Commerce with foreign Nations

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Among the several States

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,776
And with the Indian tribe the power to regulate commerce

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Four nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes there are no more sexier words in the English language

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
Better words for wooing we're never written

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
That's Jamie Floyd savitsky Wilmington properly in a second

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Okay so

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
Turns out that question of like what is it

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
Is pretty easy in words

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
In the Constitution this a

38
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Congress has the power to regulate

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
Commerce from one state to another

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Like as soon as it goes between states across state borders

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Besides

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,056
Regulate I think there was a sigh would begin and end and that would be the other it's all good

43
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Yes

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
But here's the thing

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
Within that she'll of boring

46
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
Impolitely silence here is

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
I didn't mazing story

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Of a kind of cosmic power that develops from very humble beginnings to something truly extraordinary and maybe traveling

49
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
New York

50
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,936
A cosmic power you mean this phrase from the Constitution has had consequences

51
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
That surprised you a hoe boy

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Oh boy here's how I've been thinking about it in the more perfect story

53
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
For me

54
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,968
The experience I had learning by the Commerce Clause was a little bit like watching the X-Men movies

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
Initially it was like my name is Magneto why is Magneto the head of the bad guys

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
Was why were they follow him he has the most boring power

57
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Mega control metal OK Google like Mystique can shift into any shape she wants storm can

58
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,496
Control lightning initially his power seem like you have the worst one

59
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Sup we start with the Commerce Clause

60
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
And we asked the riddle of Magneto trying to cross the bridge getting I'm getting there

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,552
All I'm saying is that like initially I didn't understand the true deep nature of his power but then

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
You see the seats where he's like being attacked by a thousand policemen and he just kind of

63
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Mixed are bullets freeze in midair for a pics of a whole Bridge with lights

64
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,288
Pointing at it and then hit you up

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
He has the best power

66
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
Because the whole world is made of metal she can control the world

67
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
If we build the world a different way baby not but

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
In this world you say I'm Frankenstein's monster

69
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
Periodic table baby periodic table baby

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
For me what it was like to learn about the Commerce Clause

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
What initially seems stupid and boring

72
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Extraordinary powerful once you understand the world in which it is situated is that mean you're about to take a

73
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,551
On a journey which begins with something that feels utterly trivial

74
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
And ends up with being

75
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Something

76
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Enormously powerful

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Wow

78
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
Has a question to which I simply must answer

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Yes

80
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
What's the weather out there

81
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
Tell you the story of the Commerce Clause everything we fight

82
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
America

83
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
Is in the 16 words

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
United States

85
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Supreme Court of the United States

86
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,543
United States

87
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,047
Alright I'm going to I'm going to start you good

88
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Do you even explain why

89
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Something like the Commerce Clause exist

90
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
Split a dollar bill issued by

91
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
A central bank

92
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Are you looking at dollar bill right now

93
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Stop looking dollar bill

94
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Citizens Federal Reserve Note United States of America

95
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,783
That is James Chen professor of law at Michigan State University now the

96
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Sing about

97
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
A dollar bill the awesome obvious thing is that you can

98
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Take a dollar bill and buy

99
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
Some Sour Patch Kids or whatever dollar buys these days anywhere in America

100
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
But in the late 18th

101
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Century back all the way through

102
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
220 century

103
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,543
Was like that no no no no no all the states have their own Banks

104
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Their own bills different sizes colors example there's a moment when South Carolina has it pretty little green South

105
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
South Carolina Bill same time Rhode Island

106
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Has this giant

107
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Pink

108
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
Square thing and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode Island trying to buy some

109
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Carrots and potatoes let's say while you hand them your South Carolina bill

110
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
Well the Rhode Islanders would look at that and say why don't know what this is

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Who's the trust this bank right and so they would

112
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
Discount the note based on the distance

113
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
From their own home they would discount the note based on

114
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
How it looks how professionally drawn up it was

115
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
They might look at that $10 and say

116
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
That's only worth 8 to me I feel horrible

117
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Horrible way to do business

118
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
That sucks for the person holding the note right

119
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,327
Until what the government decided to do is to say 8 words is one bill

120
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Swindell

121
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
To be so much easier

122
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
This is one of the ways God was going to pull all these

123
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Different states

124
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
Together they're going to regulate the current

125
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
And not just the currency itself they were going to regulate the flow

126
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Event currency

127
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
And this is where the Commerce Clause comes in

128
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
This is Jamie Floyd

129
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Journalist

130
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
Host of all things considered here early in the Republic now we're at 1820s

131
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,911
Now just to hit pause for 1 second to the Commerce Clause with a pre-existing

132
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,031
Thank ya in the US Constitution really like

133
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
Thought about her or where where is it in the minds of people a day

134
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
You know we're pretty much where it is right now

135
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,271
No we're not other people

136
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,647
She says 1824 to Steamboat operators get into a thing it's a business

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Are you going back and forth between New York and New Jersey that you think they should be the only one allowed to do that and it makes its way as we say

138
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
All the way to the US Supreme Court

139
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,031
Who's sitting up there will a big bad dude named John Marshall

140
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,687
Marshall is the sort of Rambo

141
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Of the course

142
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
He look at those 16 words have the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations

143
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,975
He look at those 16 words and a couple of, Sandra. You decide

144
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Pretty much for the first time

145
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Did those words give Congress the power

146
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
To regulate

147
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Commerce

148
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Between and among states

149
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
This boat is going from one state to the other the only way to resolve that

150
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
Is for the federal government to come in

151
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
And controller

152
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,967
Again the idea is it this is the only way for the country

153
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
To function as a unified thing

154
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
John Marshall's decision

155
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
He says

156
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
You look we have United States of America

157
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,815
We don't have a divided States of America or independent States of America

158
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
Or New Jersey and New York existing separately

159
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
We decided

160
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
To organize

161
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
As a United States

162
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
And so what

163
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
John Marshall says his beak

164
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Cause of that

165
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:56,223
There has to be a power to regulate trade between those days in amongst those days

166
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
When there are disputes

167
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Otherwise it's all going to fall apart

168
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
It was at that point that the Commerce Clause

169
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Began to Glow

170
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Womb very faintly

171
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
For the next hundred years the government experiment with Commerce Clause in cases involving trade with a Native American tribe

172
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Navigation but if you want to talk about power

173
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Like real

174
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Raw

175
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Weird

176
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Penn Power

177
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,903
That power got Unleashed at a very specific moment around 1941

178
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
In a wheat field

179
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
Well what happened in the weekly okay well let me introduce you to

180
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
My father was a farmer I'd like to say all of his life

181
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,871
Pride in the fact that he never he never work for another man he would tell me that

182
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
Well my name is the same as my father at

183
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
Roscoe Curtis filbrun

184
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
I'm a junior Roscoe filburn the time use a 5th generation farmer

185
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
In Montgomery Ohio our farm was just right next to Dayton OH

186
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
While moscow

187
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Is about 40 year old man

188
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
At this point

189
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
Can we talk about 1941-42 good-looking

190
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Sturdy

191
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
Fiercely independent I never worked

192
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
For another man in my life

193
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Apparently that was his motto

194
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
He would tell me that many times over the years if you had to put like Captain America with a pitchfork

195
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
This is

196
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,999
So Roscoe's got this far more than a hundred cows on it

197
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
He would milk cows until both of these arms when practically now catch chickens mm

198
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
And a we had a very big Garden he would plant things you know light string beans lime

199
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Angie's sweet corn potato carrot radishes all different kinds of apples

200
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Trees are strawberries and raspberries

201
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Different kinds of Halo and of course

202
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Sweet sweet

203
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
Okay set up out of the way here's what happened

204
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
It's 1941

205
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Roscoe

206
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Senior my dad was out in the field I think on his tractor

207
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
That day he was plowing the weed or something and

208
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
Apparently must have been some guy

209
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
From the

210
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
Department of Agriculture locally

211
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,647
I guess going around to various farmers in our community

212
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
Wanting the farmers to answer

213
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Several pages I think of questions

214
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,911
And this particular day this government gentleman came out into the field

215
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
You looked around

216
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
And he said Roscoe

217
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
Oceans you got 22 Acres

218
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
You're over your quota

219
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
He was 11.1 Acres over

220
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
What was permitted

221
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
Roughly inside with the guy tells him he have to pay a fine

222
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
A really big fine

223
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,839
My dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom on a murder case

224
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
And what happened next

225
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
We change the country forever

226
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,823
Ways that we are still literally living with but make sure to fill in the gaps here

227
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
Play what you need to know about why they're they were even having this conversation

228
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
And to help me with that my name is

229
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,343
Sorry savitsky and I'm an attorney at law

230
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
An important thing to understand is that you know when our story starts with Roscoe filburn

231
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Pictures of the Great Depression is happening

232
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
And the Dust Bowl

233
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
And so you have a lot of people who rely on selling crops and buying crops and so wheat prices to matter of life

234
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Millions of Americans

235
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
This nation is asking for action and action now

236
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
1938 Congress in Acts was called the agricultural adjustment act to reboot

237
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
The economy so the 1938 agricultural adjustment act got the federal government into the

238
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
Regulating wheat

239
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,127
Busy with the government did was they said to the farmers America we are going to give you essentially alone we're going to

240
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,967
Guarantee you a certain minimum price

241
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
For wheat

242
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,575
We're going to give you X number of dollars per bushel or whatever it is

243
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
That will help lift you out of poverty

244
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
In exchange for that

245
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
You have to promise US

246
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
To only grow a certain amount

247
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
It's in the big fear was it they grew too much

248
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
There be the

249
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Flood of Supply on the wheat market prices would crash

250
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
And that would be bad for everyone you know weed is sort of a collective action problem right everyone's going to sell as much weed as they can but that

251
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
That means prices go down and everyone makes less

252
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
So what the government decides to do in addition to giving out loans is that they placed a cap on how much wheat a person could grow

253
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
So quote

254
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Straight up quotes

255
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,719
That way you ensure the supply of wheat is steady and you insured

256
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
That that the prices don't crash

257
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
And whole reason the government could do this

258
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Regulate the entire wheat Market

259
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
What's by henredon the Commerce

260
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Colossus 16 words

261
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Basically said

262
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,895
That when something like wheat is bought and sold and moved from one place to another one state to another cross state lines

263
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,991
Well that's Interstate Commerce and that's something that Congress can regulate

264
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,927
So my father having his back to Roscoe filburn without inspector

265
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
On his farm

266
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Spectra says

267
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Look Roscoe you've grown too much weed my dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom

268
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Romano murder case

269
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
And what do you think he says back he says wait a minute I'm going to show you exactly how I feel about that

270
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
No

271
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,479
That's how I feel know you government might have been a family guy she says I don't get it

272
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
I'm not I'm not have nothing to do with interstate commerce

273
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
And

274
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
This is the key

275
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
Explain to the inspector that yes

276
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,631
According to the government quota I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres a week and I am growing 23

277
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
The next R12

278
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
I'm not selling it to anybody

279
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
He doesn't sell them

280
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
He doesn't trade the way

281
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,895
What's he doing with this week he uses all the wheat to feed his animals

282
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Feeding it to the farm animals the weight

283
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,039
He said the sum of the week to the stairs I

284
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
I was just keeping it on the farm well yeah so it send it

285
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
Sweetly internal operation I'd like the poor guy gets kind of Dragon 2

286
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
National case inspector I have nothing to do with interstate commerce

287
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
I'm on my phone I'm doing my business

288
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
Big Brother leave me alone but

289
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Big brother does not leave me alone

290
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
The inspector

291
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
Says we're the government that's the law

292
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Please uphold it

293
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Pay

294
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
The fine

295
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
50 Cent

296
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
For every excess bushel I think it is

297
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,999
Yeah 239 excess bushels of wheat for which she was unifying about 117 bucks

298
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
In today's dollars

299
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
It's about two grand

300
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
2 Grand

301
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
My my father

302
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,567
Apparently he wasn't real crazy about that and I guess he didn't like that too much

303
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
If I'd have been 20 or 25 years old

304
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,271
I would have probably advised my father not to do what he did but I guess they sue the federal government

305
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Huh

306
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
His army was like look I'm just trying to feed my cows come on I guess it went to our core

307
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Church in Dayton Ohio

308
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
That was the first and I believe

309
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
That he wants round1 to Roscoe the Ohio court agreed there's no

310
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Commerce of any kind going on your unlike the original case with the boat price I believe I even remember

311
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,967
My sister telling me that the he came a home

312
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,063
And he was just delighted that he did win

313
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
But then

314
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Government feels the case and of course the one that got to the Supreme Court of the United

315
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
It states

316
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
He he did he lost

317
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Key lost

318
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
Any decisions that I think it's fair to say

319
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Still

320
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
Drives conservatives and Libertarians bonkers

321
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Either one of those things but I get it

322
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
What does Supreme Court set

323
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,111
Is it Roscoe filburn growing that extra weed and not selling it still

324
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Counts as interstate commerce

325
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Could have that extra week causes him to not

326
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
On the market

327
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,935
He needs less wheat from the market in all the farmers of America did that

328
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,847
Cannot be really bad for the market the idea is that if you need more wheat than the quota

329
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
You go on the market and buy it

330
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Even though you can grow it yourself

331
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,063
Everyone can produce their quota and then whatever extra they need

332
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
I'm pretty soon the regulation breaks down

333
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
Which means it's a government intervention in the wheat Market will have failed

334
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
You will have to

335
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,887
Beaded our attempt to regulate this Market therefore we have to regulate even the things you don't do

336
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
That is so weird it's such a mine frankly it's like

337
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
He's not doing anything

338
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,711
What was the term literally known Behavior this is Obamacare

339
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,623
Getting heated over Health Care individual mandate

340
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,255
Just explain that's a reference to Barack Obama's healthcare plan hotly-debated

341
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Couple years ago still hotly debated

342
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
What are the key ideas without plan is it in order for health care to be affordable for everyone

343
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,495
Everyone should have to buy it so we're going to require people

344
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
To buy insurance

345
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
Where else you pay a penalty

346
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,455
Which made a lot of people mad cuz they're like hey the government force me to buy something I don't want my decision not to get Healthcare

347
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Is not

348
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
Participation in interstate

349
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
It's not even economic activity

350
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
I'm sitting here on my couch not buying

351
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
You sitting here

352
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,023
From the individual perspective that makes perfect sense but if you can out

353
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
And Justice Kagan said this in court

354
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,191
It's not so simple uninsured people are increasing

355
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
Normal family premium Congress

356
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
$5 a year

357
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,063
The price that everybody pays for the service

358
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,464
Obamacare makes sense to me away but getting back to Roscoe

359
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,328
Things you're not because you cannot know farmers and Island this is the case

360
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
In which

361
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Congress

362
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
Receives a tremendous amount of power from the US Supreme Court

363
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Essentially this case

364
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
It says that Congress can regulate

365
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
Almost anything

366
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
And that is

367
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
D single

368
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Most significant precedent

369
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
In the area of the Commerce Clause the Big Bang

370
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
Did anyone try to raise their hand in the

371
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,080
Camillus be like whoa if you can regulate the non behavior of this American Farmer

372
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Then that's not even a slippery slope that's like a cliff that goes right down like there's no slope to that

373
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,320
Times editorial from November 13 1942

374
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,184
Set the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own Farm competes with Commerce

375
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,024
Would not the housewife who makes herself address suzhou equally

376
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
The net of the ruling in short seems to be

377
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,936
The Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it's so decide

378
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
Would not the housewife who makes herself address

379
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
You so you got to say yeah it's like yeah if you make something like shoot I've my wife and I with our kids made these little like

380
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,016
A miniature stuffed animals for them to play with the other day are we then in violation of some

381
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
Oh my God

382
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
So like what happened here essentially Robert Issa thiam

383
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
The definition of Commerce

384
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
Changed and is in a sneaky but it really powerful way

385
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Is now it wasn't just like the buying and selling of stuff

386
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
It was the not buying and selling

387
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Yeah it was your negative

388
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,968
Commercial acting all the things you don't do is a much bigger territory than the things you do do

389
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Yeah

390
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Extension of

391
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,136
And that expansion would continue over the next few decades and it would move them just weeds

392
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
To something much deeper to like

393
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
Beyond markets into the into matters

394
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
The heart

395
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,144
You mean like people hating on each other people

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Trusting people being bred people

397
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
All will become clear after the break myaurora and after the break

398
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
Excuse me while I get myself of this sizzling drink and settle down in my black leather couch

399
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
Couch yeah alright season 2 finale of more perfect here on Radiolab

400
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,488
Will continue in a moment

401
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,376
This is Nicole from Corning New York

402
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in

403
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544

More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

405
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,016

And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

408

We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear

409
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Did something

410
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

411
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

412
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:58,880
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

413
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

414
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

415
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
If you have a story please share it with us

416
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:19,872
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

419
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
Huron Radiolab strange and Hartfield salute

420
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
To the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution

421
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
Yes and a previously we had the big bang in the Wheatfield but that was still about markets in Commerce and all that

422
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Right

423
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
There was a moment

424
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
But two decades after the Wii case

425
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Where you might say

426
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
The Commerce Clause got weaponized

427
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Hello hey can you hear me

And where are you speaking to us from right now

440
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Time in Birmingham Alabama

00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
You were born Birmingham

442
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Yes

443
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,304
Aside from some time at college in Florida and a stint in the Coast Guard Ali jr.

444
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Has lived in Birmingham in his entire life

445
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
And the reason we call them up is that for 75 years

446
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
His family ran

447
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
A Famous BBQ joint

448
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Name dali

449
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
This is your dad's birthday

450
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
From what I understand right yes my grandfather founded it

451
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Oh really what was that

452
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
1926 to this was passed to your dad who passed

453
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
To you yes

454
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Okay we were in business together till he died

455
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,488
Holley's BBQ was located on Birmingham Southside the building we were in its time you're talk

456
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
1949 till 68

457
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
It was concrete

458
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Blocker

459
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,448
Big sign outside said world's best barbecue good for today

460
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Barely during lunch

461
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
Align with stretch out the door

462
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
Ollie's was famous for its slow-cooked pork and chicken and for its spicy vinegar BBQ sauce

463
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,016
In the pie baking chocolate pies in a lot of pies

464
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
But all these was also famous or would become famous

465
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
For something else entirely

466
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
McAllister the times

467
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
The way things were

468
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
At that time course

469
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
Throughout South Birmingham

470
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
We had

471
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
Carryout business

472
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
As well as

473
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
Sit down Bass

474
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
And

475
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Those

476
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
How are Black customers came in and

477
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
I order from the carryout counter

478
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
But their food out

479
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
And

480
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Truth fact history

481
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Take it on

482
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Witham Tito supposed to

483
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Just sitting down and eat

484
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,536
What he saying is that all these barbecue with segregated if you were white you can eat inside if you are black

485
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
You couldn't remain that way

486
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
The way to work

487
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
So what is the temperature of the Commerce Clause okay so the Federal

488
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,616
At the time this will be the Kennedy administration and LBJ

489
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
They want to come down and places like Ollie's barbecue but their hands were sort of tied

490
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
We have this thing called the Fourteenth Amendment says no State shall deprive any person

491
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:51,072
Life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any state the night equal protection of the laws

492
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:56,448
Stephanie person

493
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
4 written

494
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
Basically outlaw

495
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Things like segregation

496
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Corseted work

497
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,176
We have another 80 plus years of Jim Crow and the reason for that

498
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,272
Is it the Supreme Court shortly after the 14th amendment was passed

499
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,112
Kind of neutered it not kind if they did

500
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,256
What they did was by insisting that we read the 14th Amendment as being targeted

501
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:26,656
Only at States if you look at that sentence II says the Fourteenth Amendment says no state knost

502
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
State shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without depressive problem is is when

503
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
A restaurant owner like Ali McClung deny service to Black patrons

504
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
It's not Alabama doing the damage

505
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:48,672
Just private business of Alabama ordered McClung family to discriminate against black patrons they just

506
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,488
So if the 14th amendment can only get two states

507
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:58,400
Hear it has no reach because there's no State action there is nothing to regulate at the state level

508
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
So

509
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
The best decided to do

510
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
If that's a dating

511
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
Legal gymnastics is they decided to use

512
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,480
Commerce Clause

513
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
Congress passes the most sweeping Civil Rights bill ever to be written into the law

514
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
July 2nd 1964 Congress passes

515
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Sweeping Civil Rights bill that was hinged on those

516
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
16 words and I will explain to you how

517
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
It's kind of fascinating

518
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
It just a second

519
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
The first

520
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Just to get us to that point

521
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
So 1964 Civil Rights

522
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Act

523
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Past

524
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Did you desegregate right away

525
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
No

526
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
Can we work we were not happy with it obviously

527
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
I want to read you something that you said in nineteen

528
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
54 I believe you sir

529
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,000
Serve your account of something that happened in

530
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Indian restaurant

531
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Day after the Civil Rights Act was

532
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Past

533
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,424
A black man comes into the restaurant asking to be served

534
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
And

535
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
And you turn him away

536
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,080
45 minutes later comes back with young girl for all the black people they say

537
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
Sit down at the counter they want to know

538
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408
Why

539
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
You why all these wouldn't serve them

540
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
And they were taking notes

541
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
And your CO2 the same esteem like agitators

542
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
Yeah exactly where they

543
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
They were folks and came

544
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,000
And when around several places

545
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Just

546
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Test the law basically yeah

547
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
And you were and you were turning those folks away

548
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Yes

549
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Kick them out

550
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Why

551
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
I'm just because that's way

552
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Had always done this way

553
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Until the law

554
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Got to judicate it

555
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
We weren't going to

556
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Unilaterally

557
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,624
Change light that you know that from their perspectives are there because the laws been changed

558
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Yeah

559
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Yes

560
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Holly says right after the Civil Rights Act

561
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Pass

562
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
Serving emergency meeting was called of the Birmingham

563
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Restaurants association

564
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Penis adwin

565
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
I discussed with the

566
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,920
With an executive of it

567
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
This was

568
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Going to be such a

569
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Potentially

570
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Harmful to the

571
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,136
Restaurant businesses make you an ass all your way customers is that what you worried about

572
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
I mean that was a possibility

573
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
And

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Somebody ought to do something

575
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
So we can end up being

576
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Wants to do something

577
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
IFR filing suit

578
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Today file the suit

579
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,592
Basically saying to the federal government you have no right to barge into our

580
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Small

581
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Independent

582
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Local business

583
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Start was

584
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
They can't really

585
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
Tell us what to do because we're not in Interstate business and that's all that the federal government regulates and

586
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
Up until that point that was all they had regular

587
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
The case went to the US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama

588
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Panel

589
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
We had a unanimous

590
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Decision

591
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Our favor

592
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
The Alabama Court agreed

593
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
There was

594
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,592
No interstate commerce happening year

595
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
And that always did not have to desegregate

596
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
They can sell their ribs to whoever they wanted

597
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
And we were

598
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Optimistic about that

599
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Government that Appeals

600
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
And the case

601
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
They say it goes all the way to the Supreme Court

602
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
Alright let me know explain to you how the government made this arguments they made it in court

603
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,544
October 5th 1964 General Archibald Cox

604
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,944
Lays it out why the government should be allowed to use the Commerce Clause of all things to desegregate

605
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
Napoli's operate a restaurant in Birmingham Alabama specializing in Barber

606
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
He said this is a business that sells and buys a lot of meat

607
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
1960

608
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:15,680
Yeah please prices about $70,000 worth of meat 60 9680

609
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:22,080
$3 to be exact

610
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,408
Tim Alabama

611
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Song that that plan

612
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,552
Came from other states so did move to another state

613
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
In other words you think you're a local business but you're not meat is sourced from places other than

614
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,352
In Alabama what about your ketchup aesthetically

615
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
Not mine in Alabama so even though we bought it from a local vendor that local vendor probably bought it from somebody who

616
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
Bought it from somebody that they were reaching beyond what it ever been done before basically

617
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,480
Gavin was basically telling them the same thing they told Roscoe Phil breath

618
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
You are not an island

619
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,440
And that was only the government's first argument they had another argument

620
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
That is a second then still more directly

621
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
It was even more

622
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Radical

623
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
Trans racial discrimination

624
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
Restaurant

625
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Interstate

626
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
Which is caused by the artificial narrowing of the

627
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Supermarket

628
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Resulting from the

629
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
So here's the argument

630
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,504
If you deny black people access to restaurants and hotels

631
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,344
You are effectively shutting down interstate travel by them

632
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
Imports of the country where this practice

633
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
Is commonplace

634
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Entire

635
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,584
Deep South you're limiting their ability to cross state lines and

636
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
The central argument

637
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Suggestion is that

638
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
When you discriminate against someone

639
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
You create

640
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Down

641
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Stream

642
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Negative

643
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Commercial effects

644
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
Like you create a chilling effect

645
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,808
Because the person you're discriminating against is then less likely to travel a

646
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Across state lines

647
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Send money

648
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
So in effect you are

649
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Depressing their future

650
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Interstate commerce

651
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
If you ask

652
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Black people

653
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
With this experience

654
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
From this time.

655
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,448
They were universally say

656
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
We never left home unless

657
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Every

658
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Tire

659
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
Was triple checked

660
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Every

661
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
Belt was triple checked in the car

662
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Because we did not

663
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,064
Want to have a car breakdown in a hostile southern town

664
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
And get lynched

665
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Right right

666
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,720
It is an entire system

667
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
Of travel and commerce that's

668
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
At stake here

669
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,888
Essentially the argument was discrimination is bad for business

670
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Is expensive

671
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
And

672
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,264
Ultimately in a unanimous decision

673
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
The Supreme Court

674
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
Same court that 100 years earlier had basically gutted the 14th Amendment

675
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,664
Supreme Court

676
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Agreed

677
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
That discrimination in restaurants pose significant burdens on the quote

678
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,648
Interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products China

679
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
Remember that decision coming down

680
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
I'm certainly

681
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Where were you

682
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
Pause at work

683
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,448
Can you tell me a little bit about how you and your dad

684
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
Process that decision

685
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
Simply

686
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616
Heard anyone who came in after that

687
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
And they were

688
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,296
The very next day there was a group of local law civil rights leaders who came in and ate lunch

689
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
I knew some of them by

690
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Haven't seen him in the news that sort of thing

691
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
They were not our regular customers

692
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Orlando actor

693
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
Franklin

694
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Lay

695
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,864
Celebrated our what even want to say

696
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
Tested I don't know what the motive was because I came in late lunch

697
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
They got served

698
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
It's like anybody else

699
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
They came in and it was fine

700
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
The law was recited seoul

701
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
That was it

702
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
With a tent

703
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
No

704
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
I don't know why Tricia was waiting on those

705
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
She was a little

706
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Answer about it

707
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
And it was at this way just to see a black woman yes

708
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
It was now but she was

709
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,376
Like most my employees been there a very long time

710
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Panda

711
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Have never

712
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
Served other black folks

713
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
In a sit-down situation and

714
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
And Quest

715
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
It was surreal

716
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Little bit

717
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
Say upsetting but

718
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
Different cute little hesitant at first sight

719
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
What's the right hand side of abdomen

720
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,880
She didn't we didn't

721
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
That was not a problem

722
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,048
After the ruling it's not as if a lot of Black customers 70/30 coming into Ali's BBQ

723
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
They didn't

724
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,144
A guy named Nathan Turner Jr put it

725
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
2014 he was interviewed

726
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Turn into herpes

727
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
He grew up nearby Ollie's

728
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
Just a fact of olive

729
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
Pushed it that far

730
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
To take it to the

731
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Supreme Court

732
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
It left a bad taste

733
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Pun intended

734
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
In the mouth of a lot of black

735
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
People in Burma

736
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
In-N-Out 53 years later

737
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
How do you think about that Supreme Court decision

738
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Well

739
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
You're at if you're asking about segregation that's one thing we asked about Supreme Court and

740
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
Seasoning on the Commerce Clause I still disagree with

741
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
Let me put it real

742
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
Real succinctly

743
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
I think

744
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
What you had

745
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
And that

746
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Decision

747
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Was it rather than

748
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Can affect my

749
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Civics

750
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
Correct but I don't know

751
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,184
It rather than three-quarters of the Congress

752
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,048
And 3/5 of the states I believe it is having two

753
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
Or maybe 2/3 Carlos whatever it is

754
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Having to vote to

755
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
Repeal an amendment to the car

756
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Constitution

757
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
You had basically 9 appointees who repeal the 10th Amendment

758
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Constitution

759
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
The Tenth Amendment basically says that the powers not given to the feds

760
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Are reserved

761
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
The states

762
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
For the people

763
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
That's about as succinct as I can

764
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,624
Would you understand how this is going to sound to a lot of our listeners

765
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
I mean that you are making a states rights argument

766
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
As a not-so-veiled weight

767
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
To continue to discriminate

768
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
They're really in the end this is not about

769
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
States rights I think that's going to I was going to sound to a lot of people

770
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
Well it may very well but it's not the case

771
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
Was there segregation yes

772
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
Where we going to voluntarily

773
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
And that

774
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Probably not

775
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
Would we go back and reinstate if we could

776
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
No apps

777
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Not

778
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
But

779
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
The

780
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
Issue that you're talkin about with the

781
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
Commerce Clause in the

782
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Constitutional

783
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Issue

784
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
Are still just what I said

785
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:15,520
So you still believe 53 years later that the Supreme Court got it wrong that they should have never

786
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
Use the Commerce Clause to make you desegregate Ali

787
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
Yep that is correct

788
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,760
But don't hear me say that I don't want to go back to have segregation again

789
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
That's

790
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Separate issue

791
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
But is it separate I guess is my question you know

792
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
My God grant you

793
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
If you think of it in the abstract

794
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
Federal government being able

795
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
How to regulate

796
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Commerce across

797
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
All boundaries

798
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
Is an enormous power

799
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,984
And he could be a scary power so I grant you that at the same time

800
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,776
You have a Civil Rights Act

801
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
That

802
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
It speaks to a different amendment in the Constitution

803
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:57,247
Egyptian writing that you and your father were not willing to follow so how is the government going to get you to

804
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
To pay attention

805
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
And again line

806
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
They've got to use the Commerce Clause

807
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
So on some level isn't it

808
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Isn't

809
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Power

810
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Present

811
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Because the other principles

812
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,071
It would otherwise regulate your Behaviour

813
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Just aren't working

814
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
That's the point

815
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Choose which

816
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
Which is the priority

817
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Basically

818
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
I understand that you would which is the priority

819
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
I will

820
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
Which is the priority of

821
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
Those amendments

822
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,111
Until for you the 10th Amendment that grants states rights

823
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
For everything. Enumerated

824
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Outweighs

825
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
The Dignity of black people

826
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
No

827
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
No

828
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
Will put so say to me differently then

829
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Well

830
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
The 10th Amendment

831
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Lieutenant

832
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,031
The states

833
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
The Fourth Amendment yes

834
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
An agreement to take the 14th amend

835
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Guess

836
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
People rights

837
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Everyone rides

838
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
But here's the thing about rights

839
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,903
It's kind of like the first law of thermodynamics

840
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
There's only

841
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,279
And people don't realize this a lot of times they only so many rights

842
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
Only a finite number rights

843
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
If you take some

844
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
Give something to someone

845
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
They come from someone else or somewhere

846
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Now

847
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
It's very well to say that

848
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
The end of segregation

849
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
Was a higher

850
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Right

851
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
And more importantly

852
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
Then

853
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,391
They misuse of the Commerce Clause

854
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
Whatever you want to say

855
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,511
But you're still a balance and just

856
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
Which one you

857
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
Think it's most important

858
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Today's products become a zero-sum

859
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
Bali's basic point

860
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
We talked about this for another hour

861
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
Was it in achieving desegregation that

862
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
By the way

863
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
Civil Rights Act

864
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,855
54 dramatically alter

865
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,415
Without the desegregated huge parts of the South

866
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
By doing it that way

867
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Says with the converse

868
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Something was sacked

869
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,351
Feisty calls it a zero-sum I wouldn't call it that

870
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
I don't think most people

871
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Call it that

872
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Treating people with dignity

873
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
Quality is a net win

874
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
.

875
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
But

876
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
It is legitimately strange

877
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
Did the government had to take such

878
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,831
Around about ass-backward way

879
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
To fix this

880
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
To fix this grave Injustice

881
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,487
What what what you would think would be the obvious

882
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,559
That you would go right to those civil rights

883
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
Parts of the Constitution

884
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:58,495
It was weird is it we have the 14th Amendment and yet we go to the

885
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
Commerce clause for something

886
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,175
That is so clearly stated in one of the amendments

887
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
Search Jamie Floyd Again by the way

888
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
The lawyers in those cases

889
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
Is that what they wanted to win

890
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,975
They wanted to win more than they wanted to make a social statement about

891
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,583
Equal justice equal rights the 14th Amendment I mean those things matter

892
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
Most of all they wanted to win

893
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
They wanted to shut down discrimination

894
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:35,359
Athos lunch counters and if Congress could shut them down or require them to open their doors to all them

895
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Americans using

896
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
Those 16 words

897
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
I'm okay with that

898
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Yeah yeah

899
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,343
No I mean obviously the if the ends do justify the means in that case

900
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:50,975
But it does make you if you should have put that case and the weak case in your mind as a kind of split screen

901
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
It's

902
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
It's a little strange because I do think okay we have

903
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
I didn't mean it I said it

904
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
Hopefully we're Americans with principles

905
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
Does it matter you know that we believe in equality believe in racial

906
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Call Justice

907
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
But really we just believe in money

908
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
And we can do all the other stuff by bootstrapping it

909
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
E-commerce

910
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
But somehow as as pure principles

911
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,367
Play what don't have teeth while it's deeply troubling that we have to use

912
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Commerce to achieve our

913
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
Higher values

914
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,999
That is weird to me that is

915
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Fundamentally weird

916
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
It's kind of cynical

917
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
Well yeah I mean

918
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
I

919
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
You are right we are

920
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,983
At least in large part about

921
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Commerce in the sky

922
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,567
But if that's who we are

923
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,407
Then we should embrace it and use it to our advantage

924
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,271
And if we can use it to our advantage perhaps it does take us

925
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Two are higher princess

926
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,391
How to understand why it's not all bad

927
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,559
What if Jamie's points actually thought it was that

928
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Legislating morality

929
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
Fletchling what is good and what is bad

930
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
Doesn't always go well

931
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Cuz we very often don't agree

932
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
Galaxy there been times where people kept slaves and thought that was

933
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,247
That was right

934
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,111
400 years you had the 14th amendment in place but it couldn't solve all these barbecue

935
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
And here was a way

936
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,303
For the government without going at the moral questions head-on

937
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
Government can reach its hand all the way into the barbecue joints in the hotels in the restaurants and the houses and now the cake shops of America

938
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,567
Reached an all the way down into the local

939
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
And it was because of this increasingly expensive idea of Commerce

940
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,039
That was now no longer the buying and selling of things or the knot

941
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,087
Buying and selling of things it was now

942
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
Any Behavior

943
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,951
They could create a kind of butterfly

944
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
That might one

945
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,839
Day many steps Downstream

946
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
Have a future effect

947
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,447
On the buying and selling of things

948
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
Has right his case

949
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
That was a massive shift

950
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
It shifted totally the federal government's role Beyond business even if you

951
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
You think it's good then that's fine

952
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
And it's for the better

953
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,439
But just asked me realize that it was a

954
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
MasterChef from

955
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
The way

956
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,095
The country been up before that time

957
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,823
After the McClung case James Chen says

958
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,871
Service governments use

959
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,271
Of the Commerce Clause pretty much when Y no real limit

960
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,671
Begin wave those 16 word sort of like a magic want to pass laws on everything

961
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:07,071
Fair labor standards to schedule drugs

962
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
68 guns Justice for victims of trafficking Act

963
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Lions in the wild species 1592 professional and amateur sports protection

964
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
Magwitch forbid State authorized Sports gambling

965
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,855
Even had to make the argument itself

966
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
What's the government even has to defend itself

967
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
James Chen says there were times when the government would pass a law it get taken to court in the government would basically

968
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Not show up

969
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:45,215
And he would still with the government even has to argue

970
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,591
So you can see the McClung case as sort of a second big bang but then

971
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
You get to the midnight

972
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,575
At this point 1994 U of a democratic President Bill Clinton Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress

973
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
And

974
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Together they pass

975
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
The violence against women act

976
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
Today is the first day of

977
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,815
Spring and I think it's appropriate that we begin a new season of Hope

978
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:16,959
In the fight against domestic violence

979
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
I thank you all for being here

980
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
This is an important day

981
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
The Act was service sweeping rethink of the federal government's role in trying to prevent violence against with

982
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Minit beefed-up investigations

983
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
Of violent crimes against women prosecution's it allowed women to sue their alleged attackers in federal court

984
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
We had to take

985
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,839
Responsibility domestic violence is now the number one health risk for women between the ages of 15 and 44 in

986
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
North Country

987
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:49,471
And the law was hinged on the Commerce Clause same essential argument is in the barbecue

988
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,151
That same fault my name is Christy brzonkala I'm 19 years old

989
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
A woman named Christy brzonkala starts her freshman year at Virginia Tech and just weeks in September 1990

990
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,367
Before I was raped by two football players in my own dorm

991
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,951
I'd met them for the first time just 15 minutes before they assaulted me

992
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:16,351
These two football players she alleged had raped her repeatedly on a single night in 1994

993
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,911
She went to the local campus authorities

994
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
She told her story

995
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
College held their own hearings didn't go to the police

996
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
What is suspended one of the two students

997
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Key Peele

998
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
1

999
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
And when he returned

1000
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Christy brzonkala dropped out of

1001
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
Christy brzonkala

1002
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
Ultimately decides

1003
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
Sue her alleged attackers and the school

1004
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,927
Under this new law of the violence against women act

1005
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
And the case

1006
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
Ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court

1007
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,703
Will hear arguments number 99 5 Christy brzonkala vs Antonio Morrison

1008
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,103
When Christie's case got to Supreme Court her lawyer made the same argument

1009
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,199
About women that the government is made in the Ollie's barbecue case about black people

1010
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,991
That discrimination

1011
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Or in this case outright violin

1012
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:13,439
Has a huge Downstream effect on the economy

1013
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,255
Substantially affects the national economy

1014
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,607
Gender-based violence and the fear of that discriminatory violence

1015
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
Deters women's travel interstate

1016
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,751
Restricts women's choice of jobs and ability to perform those jobs

1017
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Reduces National productivity

1018
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,615
An increases medical and other costs

1019
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,223
And again the court was given tons of evidence about the economic effects

1020
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
Congress heard from women

1021
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,343
Whose batter is kept their partners for morphine

1022
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,743
Every year this cost the country billions of dollars and that economic Downstream effect was not hard

1023
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
How to prove in this case

1024
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:53,119
She dropped out if you ever get it right it's not just her

1025
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:58,495
Is everyone else who similarly situated but in this case

1026
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,103
Yarygin what's happening in a very different time in the country very different mood

1027
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,943
In front of an increasingly conservative Supreme Court

1028
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
It just wasn't buying it anymore and Arbors on Carla's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a

1029
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Chief justice rehnquist reading the majority opinion

1030
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Justice could fail to provide her a remedy for Morrison's conduct but gender motivated crimes

1031
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
Economic activity

1032
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:39,455
Another word for very sorry for what may have happened to Christine broccolibutt

1033
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
This is not Commerce this is violence suggestion was at least in the Ali's case there was

1034
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:52,511
Something bought sold in here they felt like I was too thin

1035
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,143
Accordingly reject the argument that Congress May regulate non-economic violence coming all time.

1036
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,495
Based solely on that conducts remote effect on interstate commerce

1037
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,079
Chief justice rehnquist. His majority

1038
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
2 * 2

1039
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
Chipaway

1040
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
At the Commerce

1041

YouTube Tiny teeny teeny weeny little bit

1043
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,575
Jamie Floyd says that tempt

1044
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
To roll it back

1045
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
Continue Suites rolling back

1046
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
It is rolling back

1047
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,559
Still pretty powerful don't get us wrong but where were left

1048
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
At the end of the day

1049
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,679
Is it a really confusing place

1050
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Ali

1051
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,543
McClung excluding black people from his

1052
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Dining room

1053
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,639
Yeah commercial actor

1054
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:47,039
We can sit reprehensible but I would like to think that raping Christine would be at least as bad

1055
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,111
Totally

1056
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,903
This kind of like

1057
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Absurd abstraction gets us to

1058
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
And in

1059
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
A coherent Ideal World

1060
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
Can't be right

1061
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,383
I don't know when you win that win the

1062
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
The reasoning behind something gets a little Rocky and the soul of thing

1063
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,183
It's called into question like what are you doing judges yeah for me that's what happens when you make everything

1064
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
In about money

1065
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:34,143
