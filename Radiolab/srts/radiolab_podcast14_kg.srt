1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,240
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Radiolab

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,152
From WNYC

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
And NPR

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,344
Hey I'm Jared I'm running Robert Radiolab the podcast

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,416
Actually brought a list okay let what it was 22

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
Share with me your list

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
This is Andrew Moran

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,584
He's a writer and editor at the New Yorker magazine

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
I might have gotten lost to occasionally pops on do I show

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Maybe you were mugged

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Here it is

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,336
And he recently got obsessed with a the list of measure

15
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Base units are called

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Ver SI basic

17
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,968
System international

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,296
Who did this way you ever wondered

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
How long an inch

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
I'm exactly

21
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,000
I know I took a ruler but how do you know that your ruler in my ruler do I have the

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
The same amount of each

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
He's worried that someone in China that their inches are inches your engine is

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
I haven't really thought about it but I'm just a

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
Assume that there's like a master

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Strange somewhere

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
How do I say in French

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,688
That is what was on this listing and you was looking at its a list of standard measures

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,272
For everything we have around how big something is

30
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Bar something in hot something

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
It's all in the

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Okay

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
So when you go down the list of the

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Sistema Internacional do you need

35
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
Here's what you got a meter

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
A meter is

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,192
A fraction of a second of the distance traveled by light in a vacuum okay

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Is

39
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
How much radiation corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground

40
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
State of the cesium 133 atom that's the definition of a second is a particular atom jiggle yeah

41
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
An ampere which measures electric current you know

42
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Is

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
Constant current which has maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length would produce between these conductors

44
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
The force is equal to 2 x 10 to the negative 7th Newtons per meter of length

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
I have no idea what that

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
See that's the thing if you look at the actual definition

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
There is one

48
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Standard on the list

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
It is unique

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Fritz simplicity

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
The definition of the standard unit of measurement that is a kilogram

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,832
Is no man no numbers it is a

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Sing

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
A particular thing

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Plum-sized

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Sing

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
It is the only

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
We used to measure things

59
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
Six the last one standing you'll

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Physical standard lab why is it the last

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Hawaii weather is it what wait what

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Let me just take you back to the beginning of the story

63
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
Like I must admit that I I expected this

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Story to be

65
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,368
A lot more boring that I found it's like an epic

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Story

67
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
That is Latif Nasser science historian regular on our show he says if you go all the way back to the very first farmers back in

68
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
All of the earliest measurements were super intuitive

69
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
And he says a lot of them came from the body

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,008
As in that bunny is coming close to the net

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
How close dad two hands

72
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
But it's not just like hands and feet but it was also

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
So many other kinds of measurements like you would say oh something is as far as you know my voice

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Skin care

75
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Something is as far as

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
I can see

77
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
Sitting on the top of a camel

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Or something is as far as

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
I can throw a stone

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
That would be like saying okay I'm going to build

81
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
A

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Farm here

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
And I'm going to do it

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Three throw rocks

85
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Across the way I read about it was like Travelers like if you're a Saharan traveler you know

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Junior you need to know where the next

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Watering Hole is

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Measurement yeah they would say it

89
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
Cinema 3 throw rocks away or it's time for a Rockaway

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
But you know that there might be some built-in uncertainty there because you ask Achilles

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
It could be to throw rocks

92
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,935
This way but he asked me it would be like 78 exactly the problem

93
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
System

94
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
Annie's problems kind of came to a head

95
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
In the 1700

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
It's the eve of the of the French

97
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
In a little town called Paris Cosmopolitan place which means that people are coming from different places and they all have their own

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Measure

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Approximately 250,000 different units of measurement and regular you a hundred and fifty thousand

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,071
Commodity has its own measures do you have green wine oil salt hay for wood fabric everything

101
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Ordinarily

102
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Confusing

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Not to mention it's

104
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Extraordinarily bad for

105
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
I came to you and I said miss you I have video

106
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Of cloth

107
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
You would say

108
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
How much luck you got

109
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Do Urology

110
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
What's a yard

111
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Amelia

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Is this March

113
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
Is this

114
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
And that you can see that it's frustrating it was frustrating and making matters worse 1780s

115
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Was a real family

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
So there was a shortage of grain

117
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
And people were

118
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
Hungry and people were angry

119
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Which I am going to

120
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Call audit they were hangry

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
They were hungry were very hangry

122
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,759
Studebakers at the time they knew that if they raise the price of bread like an angry mob would basically

123
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
But they also knew that with no absolute standard it was no way to be sure that what you were getting is what you were getting and so

124
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
What they started doing

125
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Was he started

126
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
Just lightening their bread loaves by Jess

127
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
So as the fam and got worse

128
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
People would be waiting in longer and longer lines

129
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
To pay the same amount of money

130
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
For smaller and

131
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Smaller load

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
So they were getting hungrier and hang

133
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
And so one of the things that

134
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
People are like crying out for is that they want

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Standardized weights and measures

136
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
If I go to the bakery

137
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
Can I buy a loaf of bread I want a whole loaf of bread

138
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Don't short me on

139
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Serious

140
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Well you you know what happens now

141
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
The Bastille

142
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Stormed in

143
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
The king is under house arrest in

144
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Then under the

145
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
Guillotine and as soon as the Revolutionary government

146
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
All right

147
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,615
Okay this is one of our first priority is we are going to make a new stand

148
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
But not based on something arbitrary like

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Kik

150
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
Why don't we

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
Drawn some kind of totally

152
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
The authority of nature

153
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Of nature

154
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,375
So long story short they took the circumference of the earth they took a quarter of that circumference divided that by 10 million and they got

155
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
The meter the mirror they then / 10 cubed it filled the cube with water to the mass of the water into the cylinder

156
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
Metal with that mass and why

157
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
They created the world

158
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
First

159
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
The idea of this

160
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Was if we make this thing that is so beautiful and perfect

161
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Everybody can

162
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
I see it that way

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
Then not only will France use it

164
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
But the whole world will use it

165
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Then goods and ideas can be exchanged

166
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Everywhere by all people and it will be

167
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
They wanted something that would be Eternal and unchanging for everybody

168
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
For all time

169
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
So now I guess you want to see it though

170
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Yeah okay

171
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Okay so it's in here

172
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
We ended up visiting the National Institute of

173
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Standards and Technology

174
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:58,719
This is where we'll be going in but we're going to go in for this guy was our guide

175
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,559
They took us three stories down into the Bedrock of the

176
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
State of Maryland

177
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Could they want things down here

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Totally

179
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
Still just gone through one Dumbledore

180
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Here comes another Dumbledore

181
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,359
Let me step into the Vault of the room

182
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Kinnaird was

183
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
What we're looking at Fan is

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
A glass jar with a handle on top and then inside that is another glass jar with a lid

185
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Little handle on top

186
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
And inside that is is the thing do you think it's

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Kind of

188
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Who is this really

189
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
The shiniest loosens you ever seen

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
Very small and it looks very clean

191
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
Hard to tell where the like Russian doll glass jar stop because it's over

192
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Reflective

193
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
This might be crazy question but can we hold a kilogram that's a producer the levy

194
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
It feels like we've been talking about it so they are very careful with

195
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
The real

196
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
The original of the original of the original

197
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
Original gong

198
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Caught

199
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
As they call it leaves in a basement

200
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
In France you can't get anywhere near.

201
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Are you cooking I can get all Tom Cruise on that die trying

202
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Here's how it works

203
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,223
The international prototype is Laguna that's the one used to calibrate 6

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,319
Identical Platinum sellers what they call witnesses for tomorrow

205
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
In French those Witnesses are then used to calibrate another set of cylinders which are then used to calibrate the u.s. standard Witchwood

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,303
Esau and that one is used to calibrate all kinds of things

207
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,935
The weight of your lemons the scale in your bathroom

208
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,543
Every time somebody loses a pound of that TV show Biggest Loser

209
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
You can actually Trace that like a bloodline if you will or an unbroken chain

210
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Back

211
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
To the international prototype kilogram

212
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
Grab to a single object in a basement in France the holy of holies

213
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
What is the Killer

214
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,231
But you're telling me that when something is weighed in the world often it goes

215
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
All the way back

216
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,607
One hunk of metal or something which was why the next part of the story

217
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Is so

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Disconcerting

219
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
What happened in 1989

220
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
Is that according to Andrew the folks who take care of the official kilogram a big k

221
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
He took it out

222
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Jars they put it in a steam bath

223
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Hit it with the steam

224
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
The prince is everything

225
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Wait for it to dry

226
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Then

227
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
They commenced a ceremonial way

228
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,231
How do you weigh the thing that is the standard of weight while you weigh it against the copy

229
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Like the US copy

230
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
Beef example so they get one of those and they put it on one side

231
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Okay on the other end

232
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
Vipk the logo on car the one

233
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Is light

234
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,175
What

235
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,503
It doesn't how many how many how much

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
Lighters invented

237
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Roughly the

238
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Mass of a grain of

239
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Sugar

240
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,815
So was that gigantic tits measurable but how do they know that it was light and not the other ones

241
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Heavy right well they didn't

242
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
So they used the second sister copy still light and

243
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
The third sister copies

244
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Still late in the fourth

245
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:29,151
5th and second comes the man from Germany from Canada light in comes the man from Spain

246
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,503
Which led them to the troubling possibility that the international standard for weight

247
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Was losing weight

248
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
Well we think that we think the big guy

249
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
As far as how it lost that weight

250
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,023
Really knowing us one possibilities about cleaned too much and maybe some of it.

251
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Scraped away although

252
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
It's disputed whether cleaning it more would make it lose weight or gain weight

253
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
The other theory is outgassing like maybe a little hydrogen is seeping out of the metal and then there was one thing I read that

254
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Foul Play cannot be ruled out I was thinking maybe

255
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,807
Malaysian here we got a hunk of metal losing weight and yet because it easily standard it still weighs exactly a killer

256
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Write up the definition of a kilogram is

257
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
The mass of the international prototype kilogram

258
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
Whatever happens when you put that thing on the scale that's a kilogram

259
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,607
You can't do that and then everything else in the world is wrong

260
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
Doesn't sit right that's like something that like the North Korean government would do

261
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Just feel like no more cash

262
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
Like that we can't just go around capriciously doing so

263
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

264
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,087
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

265
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
And I request

266
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

267
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
About what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance

268
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

269
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
It just means you lean back and say wow

270
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
How do they do that

271
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,175
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

272
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Or maybe the kid was a piano

273
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,087
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

274
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,695
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

275
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
We're interested in the

276
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Specific moments where

277
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,887
A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

278
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
If you have a story please share it with us

279
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Go to radiolab.org

280
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Flash brilliance

281
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Record short audio message

282
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Again that's radiolab.org / Brillion

283
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Thank you so much

284
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Rights of the standard of weight is

285
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
As you're saying losing weight so how do you fix

286
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Well

287
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
I'm getting 0 cell phone reception down here it means we're really do

288
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
When we were down in that underground room in Maryland we met a guy

289
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Oh there is

290
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
Okay his name is John Pratt I'm the leader of the fundamental electrical measurements group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology

291
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Analogy

292
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
John wants us to even more high security doors

293
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
Gloomy walked into this by God

294
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
Amazing Race

295
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
It's big it is big

296
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
Three stories tall

297
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Take a silver room

298
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
It has a silver gray floor at silver shiny wall

299
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
And your hair is on the Silvery side

300
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,335
Very much so

301
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
I don't even know how to do

302
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
It looks

303
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,247
Like a wheel turned on its side with the thing itself

304
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
Looks sort of just like a like a massive

305
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Round metal cauldron more like big metal

306
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Pot

307
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
But then there are all these weird little gizmos and part in and all these coiled up wires and just a stunning machine

308
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,143
But it's all just for the benefit of the one

309
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,031
1 measure 1 kilogram extremely

310
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
Extremely sensitive balance

311
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
An equal arm balance

312
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Basically like a seesaw

313
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Our a teeter totter

314
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
And

315
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,831
Usually you would set that up so that you would literally put

316
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Kid on one side of the teeter-totter kid on the other side of the teeter-totter now you've been in a playground so you know how this goes but what they've done here is

317
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
One side of the teeter-totter they've.

318
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
The kilogram like the ground guy

319
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Number one

320
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
On the other side

321
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Gattu will have

322
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Highly variable magnet

323
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,847
Now here's the thing the magnet won't be touching that side of the scale it'll be exerting a force

324
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
An invisible force

325
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
It'll produce a force

326
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
And

327
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
We could use that

328
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
To hold the balance

329
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
And of course he takes

330
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
Hold up the balance that of course is to

331
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Same as the weight

332
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Cosseting

333
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,791
And if you can convert that Force into a number that everybody agrees to Wawa

334
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,911
You have just redefined the kilogram you have wrenched

335
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Get from the world of things

336
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Has become attached

337
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
The fundamental forces of the universe

338
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Depth even grasp the gist of it

339
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
You want to see that happen

340
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
Have a great now I can show you this

341
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
With our Lego version of the watt balance

342
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
If I can fire it up Lego Lego one will see that the big one was being tested or something so

343
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
So they took us

344
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Over to look at the little one

345
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Okay so

346
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,375
We have hello scale disturb the balance and it's

347
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
El chikilin around a little hitch free-floating

348
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,055
Hey so you're now going with your tweezers and your pucking a titty bitty

349
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
What's this tiny little symbol thing on the Mountain hours going to East

350
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
To levitate

351
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,271
Now it seems he promised me Macon Macon

352
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
You know I'm going to put the Macon

353
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
And

354
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
When do we see the levitation

355
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
That was it I didn't I missed it do it again it was floating

356
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
It is floating

357
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
Sitting on the balance

358
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
That's a different idea of levitation

359
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Now the truth is that once I finally figured out what this guy was doing it was actually sort of cool he had taken a little metal way

360
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Play he put it on one side of the

361
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
On the other side of the scale

362
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Empty baguette

363
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
The thing didn't

364
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Skip over because the empty

365
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
I actually had a magnetic force equivalent

366
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
To the metal

367
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Holding

368
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Perfectly still

369
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
Dark Souls II able to do that does that mean that the grand Cay

370
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Is rain is

371
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
Not yet no because first of all week that you have to get straight with a lot of man MC squared new work back

372
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
Backwards / eaten by Amazon to be filled

373
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Let's go and you're watching your Planck's constant classical Bohr model of atoms and stuff anyway

374
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
It is actually way more complicated

375
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
This whole thing that I

376
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Prank people ever

377
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Understand but here's where we are at

378
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
You got all these different teams around the world you got John's team in Maryland with his seesaw you got another lab a couple of them

379
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Have their seesaws you got a third level

380
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
Literally counting the atoms are all doing experiments comparing numbers trying to get the numbers to agree so that by

381
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,015
I would ever rude everybody agreed on exactly what a kilogram is

382
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
Right now they're closed their they're in agreement out to about 6

383
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Decimal

384
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
Places and that's not good enough they want the numbers to be at the 8

385
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Decimals

386
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Play see if they can do that

387
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
And only then

388
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Will the grand Cape be no more

389
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Yeah

390
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Because instead of defining the kilogram as

391
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
Whatever is equal to the ground k

392
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Now you have a new death

393
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
The new definition of the kilogram to kilogram

394
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Is the SI unit of mass its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of Planck constant speed equal to exactly

395
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
6.6 26069

396
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Do we have X's cuz we haven't all agreed with the final

397
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,791
Does the missing decimals

398
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
When is expressed in the unit fractions Joule seconds which is

399
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
A meter squared kilogram per second

400
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
That'll be such a simple definition

401
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
No u

402
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,455
What will happen to the Grand Cay when the new definition goes into effect

403
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
When I saw this is the

404
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Looks like a tree

405
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Is the church where the

406
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,511
The ground Kami eventually end up in a in a place like this

407
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
That's a big deal with so many standard

408
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
I've gone to die

409
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
This is the Music These are they mature

410
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
In Paris

411
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Beginning

412
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Suzhou tour guide

413
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
What is this

414
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,663
Elite controllers the original leader

415
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Kimberly thermometer

416
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,695
Who wrote the show Des Peres this was the infallible

417
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Absolute

418
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Standard

419
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
From 18

420
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
1 -

421
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
It's in a wooden box with a velvet

422
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
And it's got

423
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Ribbons at either end

424
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,567
And it's just a very beautiful looking Silver Rod

425
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,527
No matching like the thing the grand thing being in this place

426
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Seeing the Pope in short

427
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Or something

428
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Uncomfortable

429
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
Special thanks to

430
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263

Also big props to reporter Andrew Marantz latinaass Iran

438
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
Ooo-ooo-ooo also you should go to radiolab.org

439
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,544
The Show by clicking the sport button but also to check out a collaboration video that we did with

440
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
Henry Rice from minute physics

441
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
You can see it radiolab.org are also

Yet another meditation

445
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
On what things

446
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Run things

447
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
I'm Jared I'm right I'm Robert krulwich
