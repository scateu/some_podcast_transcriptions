00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,784
That incredibly talented young boy was soon a talented young man

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
Opposing symphonies cocello

5
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Hello

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
Robert hi mist of classical music

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,584
Play the public radio interrupted by

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
Science journalist and author David, are we all here now now we're all here and you are Jennifer

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Radiolab

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,848
Actually what happened here so I called David because he has just published a book

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Which

12
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,968
Contains an idea that I found so surprised I had not

13
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
No no

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
It's kind of a

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Smack in the face

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,392
To Charles Darwin's theory of evolution

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,232
Yes there have been a number of excellent at Google that have been

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Added to Darwin

19
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
Theory over the last

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
100

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
50 years or so since he published it but

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,960
This is this is more than that this is a big freaking asterisk

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,312
And that means David told me a story

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
About a moth

25
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
Yes the peppered moth

26
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
It lives in forest

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,112
SubCentral England among other places in during the 19th century

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,696
This moth was white with little flecks of black on it

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
And please moths

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
Sometimes rooster on the trunks of trees

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,144
In the trunks of trees surrounding Manchester England restorative light color

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Roosted on the trees they were pretty well camouflage

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Alight

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
Slightly peppered moth on a light slightly pepper tree trunk

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
So they were protected against

36
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
Predation by birds

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
And then

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
The tree trunk

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
Changed why do the tree trunks chain

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
Because of the Industrial Revolution

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
Because of smoke stacks

42
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Of Manchester

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Returning out a lot of

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,632
Cool smoke they were burning cold for all their industrial processes

45
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
And there was a

46
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Good coaster that coming out and it was blanketing the trees in the nearby Forest so the tree trunk

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Turn

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Black

49
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
And

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
The mall

51
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
We're no longer camouflage cuz I'm always wear white you wouldn't want to be a white moth sitting against the cold black tree because

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Cuz then you are you're married but know exactly where you are

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Right

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
What happened

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
The Moth

56
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Turned black

57
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,728
Oh yeah sure this is the this is the classic sort of evolution story

58
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
That

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
Story was told it was a became a textbook example of darwinian evolutionary change

60
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
In in real time and the way that happens what we were told is it once the trees turn dark them off

61
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Change by incremental mutation again oh thanks to some tiny little mistake and some more

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
G the black

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,352
Spackling got bigger on certain moths and knows we're a little bit more protected and then the spackling got a little bit bigger

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Tomorrow's got a little

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Gray hair and then very very slowly over generation after generation after generation of moth

66
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
They get a little bit.

67
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Darker still

68
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
To end up eventually with a population of Martha turn

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Completely

70
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
That's the classic

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Story

72
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
Except except that we now know

73
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
That's wrong it turns out it wasn't slow

74
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
It didn't take Generations in generation

75
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
Sequencing of the moth genome has revealed

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
Stretch of DNA

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,912
22000 letters of the DNA code

78
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
That suddenly jump

79
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Into these moths

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
From somewhere

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
And in a Flash

82
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
The moths changed

83
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
From

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
White to black pretty much in one day really a white

85
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Peppered moth mom

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
All of a sudden

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
Producers in all black

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Baby

89
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Wait so how did that

90
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
How did that happen

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
It's a whole pack of jeans just got shoved in

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
To this new

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
From where did come from David says it probably

94
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Jumped

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
One part of the moth genome to a completely new part different part

96
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
But what

97
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
That means a question that living things

98
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,103
Turns out can change way faster than we thought

99
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,967
And therefore Evolution can happen much faster than we thought and on top of that David says

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Scientists have now discovered

101
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Is even stranger kind of super fast train

102
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
That

103
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Cakes

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Things about parents and Offspring individual species things we've counted on for years and just throws the whole mix into the

105
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Yes infective heredity

106
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
Effective heredity

107
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
What is what is that

108
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,007
I don't even have to explain this to you I have to go back

109
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,127
Hello I'm Jah Devil Run and I'm Robert Bill Winston's Radiolab for tattoo in earlier version of

110
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,527
Because it was 11 years ago I think that we made a show called show called V

111
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Not as we

112
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,135
Oh God that's Joanne in that show who dealt with

113
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,207
Early sort of more primitive version of this very question

114
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
Can I play you a few minutes of that other earlier show

115
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
World of living things

116
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,727
I say look at there's a cat and that's that is a dog and a new tree

117
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
You notice

118
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
List of those things of course

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Are different

120
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Yes and later we go to school

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
We learn about

122
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,247
Phylum's in categories like kingdoms and stops breathing but the nature of those differences and then you're taught

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
About struggle

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,671
Competition Darwin species and there is a new Siri

125
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
It's being talked about that all of that on it

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
I heard it first

127
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,935
I'm Steve strogatz I'm an applied mathematician at Cornell and the story he told me which is based on analysis

128
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
TNA injury tiny Oregon

129
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Micro

130
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Is it once upon a time he says

131
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
Life began with a very primitive very simple collection of cells

132
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Diesel

133
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,783
These cells life

134
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
It appears that magic when you go back far enough there's a kind of

135
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,231
Rampant sharing of molecule it's a kind of orgy in which

136
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
There are no well-defined species are organisms and

137
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,935
I can give you my jeans and you can pass what were a communist

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Totally room recording that

139
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
But that Kumbaya singing that certainly was there at the start he produced this piece years ago yes I think it was just

140
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
The office

141
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
It was a Communist economy

142
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,111
What do you mean what is it mean I know what it means in the 60s. Love since that what is it really mean what I what cells are

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Exchanging is chemical

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Chemicals that give them talents

145
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Here's what

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
I did this with Steve

147
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Huddle in Darwin public life might have begun in

148
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Warm

149
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
Let's say that you and I are both cell

150
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
The once upon a time there was you in the puddle and I'm in the same family as you

151
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
And if it gets a little colder in the puddle

152
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
Also we should all get sick but you don't get sick

153
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
You have some kind of

154
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Accidental towel you can handle cold water

155
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
I'm shivering

156
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Describe again what happens

157
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,927
At this point my membrane that is I

158
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
I'm a cell I've got a membrane I got my outer

159
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Player

160
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Maybe a little bit porous

161
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
And maybe okay we're not talking

162
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,335
Desiccated organism maybe your poor is too and I'll well you just absorb some of those jeans

163
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
So now we both have this we both got any both Gene now I can survive

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Coldwater cousins

165
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,599
And if I bump into you now it's part of you

166
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
So now that Steve has become a robber she twitches then become

167
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
Georgina doing over and over and over

168
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
I actually don't think of cells like people

169
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Changes this jeans

170
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
Swapping was not intentional it's not

171
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Purposeful show

172
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
That's Nigel golden tell a mathematical physicist at the University of Illinois give the science that

173
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,207
Play ideas. Maisel saying hey I'm going to just help out my buddy over there

174
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Hit a couple of jeans I think you'll find Handy

175
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
It's not something like that

176
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Cancel if we're swapping genes so much and you know you're going to be yours and mine what does it actually mean to be

177
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
B

178
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
MeetMe

179
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
So much money is spent around very weird imagine a world in which for a while I have your nose

180
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,015
And then I get my nose back you have Steve's hair than

181
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
Steve would get my ear that he would get you or knows I'm having a little

182
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Exchange take your chin

183
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Okay you can have my

184
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,535
Allergies and then you start even asking what does it mean

185
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
To be a species

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
You can have my love affair with

187
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,471
Doubt

188
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Individual

189
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
No identity

190
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Very strange

191
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
How long is the

192
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Concept

193
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Should we take the grandstand

194
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Become Mormon

195
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Further and further back

196
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
The roots of Urology

197
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
Take for instance Charles Darwin what night is really saying

198
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Is it for the first

199
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Billion years of life

200
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
Everything that Darwin teaches all that stuff hasn't happened to no borders no individuals has no species that is

201
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Is Darwinism

202
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Evolution

203
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
What's an interlude

204
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
In the real

205
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Story of life

206
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
It's only

207
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,271
What's happening now what you got back at the very beginning with a whole bunch of cells

208
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
Swapping genes swapping advantages swapping disadvantages

209
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
Wilder tremendous explosion

210
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
In a way that life has knots

211
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Until

212
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
3 billion years ago

213
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Interpreted

214
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Freeman Dyson

215
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Remenda famous physicist

216
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Working out their friend

217
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
You struck at Sears

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Moneyville day

219
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
A bacterium

220
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
Anticipating Bill gate by 3 billion years

221
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
Refuse to share

222
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
Refuse to share the first bad guy is this

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
The cellular

224
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Bill Gates

225
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
Who decides that I've got Innovation that I don't feel like

226
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Or Paz

227
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
I believe I found a way to

228
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
That is I'm not going to be a

229
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Seoul

230
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
And why

231
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Play what made that one little cell

232
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Decide to stop

233
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
A good question

234
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
We don't really know but we do now

235
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
Was maybe the most dramatic moment

236
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Life on Earth

237
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Transition

238
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Age of selfishness

239
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
And gradually once one creatures

240
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Stop sharing

241
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
The others followed

242
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Same thing I now

243
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
For the first time in

244
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Finally we get.

245
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Now we get speech

246
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Now we

247
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Yes

248
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
The age of identity

249
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Help individuals

250
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
Things change

251
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Exchange money

252
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Any great thing

253
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
You know like you are a bat and

254
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Figured out sonar

255
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
But I don't have

256
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
I can't get some

257
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,935
Like you're in a little electric fish that lives in the Muddy Waters

258
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Price of the Amazon

259
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Carrots totally dark you can see

260
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Because you can

261
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
C with electric

262
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
If I'm in the dark I'm bumping my head

263
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Did we really use Bill Gates's is standing for like selfishness time he was the ultimate

264
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
It's horrible that we did that

265
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
Actually going over to the to the light side instead

266
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Go to the dark side

267
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,423
That is a c strogatz I ended up calling mug

268
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Get to Chatham through some of the stuff and he told me

269
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
That he actually heard this whole idea from a lecture by physicists

270
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
Freeman Dyson Dyson adjust a great writer in a great speaker and he had this memorable line in their least memorable to me when he start

271
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Talkin about

272
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
Let me rephrase the whole thing in terms of sharing which may be why in that previous episode we had that come by awesome singing

273
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
But that wasn't my doing by the way I know know that I was

274
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Primitive bacterium anticipating Bill Gates by 3 billion years refused to share its DNA and then

275
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
That was that was Freeman Dyson that was his only way was I was sitting there in this lecture we started mentioning assert

276
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,247
Biologist Carlos and he talked about him in such glowing terms as one of the Great

277
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
Microbiologist

278
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Love our time

279
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
And see you after you hadn't heard of Carl was I had to before though I had not the reason I was asking

280
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
I think in the shower actually mentioned probably because I remember

281
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
You know I don't know if you guys know this or not but

282
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,679
So that was 11 years ago right I was actually an intern

283
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
At the time I just showed up

284
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
And I was tasked with tracking down Carlos who's the guy that we mentioned as or like the grandfather this idea

285
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
And he was like a huge

286
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,247
Huge deal in science he discovered this whole other

287
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,135
Branch on the tree of life the archaea he's Mister archaea

288
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Whole nother Kingdom

289
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,303
Front page of the New York Times and I had to track him down and turned out

290
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Use like the

291
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Just the Classic

292
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Curmudgeonly

293
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Scientist

294
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
It took me

295
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
20 emails

296
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
To get him to even like just let us talk to his

297
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,663
Collaborator Nigel goldenfeld who we talked to in the show

298
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
But whatever is a very strange he was a very

299
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Curmudgeonly man

300
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,135
But you know like he came to like me and I actually spend some time with him his office and we

301
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
I can do the curmudgeon anything if I need to know

302
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Cherokee

303
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,655
Yeah I could we got some curmudgeonly jokes back and forth and

304
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Anyway after he heard the peace

305
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Hiromi

306
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
The most seizing skating email about nothing there was nothing in it about like you got this

307
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Wrong it was just like you made a cartoon of my work

308
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
Which honestly now listening Bash

309
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
I agree with a little more than I did at the time

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
But he was like I'm a serious person and you made this into like a dog and pony show

311
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:01,631
And I was like I was brand new I was and it hurt any like I was I felt really

312
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
Really bad he's like you've disrespected Nigel

313
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
And so I wrote I wrote this hour called up Steve maybe and said man you know this happened in Steve was like a

314
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,711
Forget them don't worry about it

315
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Yeah I don't know I

316
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,879
I'd it sounds like something I might have said to you but you remember having that honestly don't remember having that conversation

317
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,047
I needed that so bad at that moment my career for someone like with Steve stature to like balance it out in that way

318
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Yeah I think

319
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Venus orbit funny that he would

320
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
Tell me a little surprising that he wouldn't have gotten what you were trying to do what we were trying to do I think our play

321
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
Playfulness in an attempt to be clear and to communicate

322
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,503
In to attract people who might not otherwise listen to a story about something called horizontal Gene transfer

323
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
He should have gotten that because

324
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
He himself in his writing was very playful

325
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,487
He was very fun to talk to I mean he was absolutely Carlos was very playful

326
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
And irascible and grouchy and

327
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,423
Farming but he would certainly tell you what he thought yeah yeah this guy is a great character

328
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,823
David quammen turns out in his new book talks a lot a lot a lot about Carl woes and this Revel

329
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,711
Pollution in our thinking about the evolution of life for the end of his life he started to think that he was more important

330
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,063
And more profound and Darwin he got a very negative attitude toward

331
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
Charles Darwin Darwin's birthday he should be a day of Rage

332
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:36,863
That's right cuz he did that but I guess I'm wondering is now that you spent a book

333
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
Attention on him do you feel that he has

334
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Some

335
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Right to say

336
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,335
That's the picture we have of how life changes needs

337
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Serious amending or is she just

338
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Parking

339
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Because he's a Barker

340
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
No he is

341
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
He was entitled

342
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
Not to think that he was greater than Darwin but to think that

343
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
What he discovered was

344
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,743
Very very damn important to understanding

345
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
The full history of evolution

346
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
On Earth what has happened all throughout the history of life on the planet

347
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
4 billion years

348
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
And is still happening today

349
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
This is where we are now

350
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359
The crazy details coming up right after the break

351
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
This is Yong Yuan calling from

352
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
From Astoria New York

353
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,399
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p

354
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959

355
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055

Www

357

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

358
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
And I'm here because I need your help

359
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
On the show

Aunts and uncles

364

Teachers looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

365
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Brilliant

366
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Basically I want to hear about this

367
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
When a kid you know did something

368
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
It just means you lean back and say

369
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Well

370
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
How do they do that

371
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Maybe it was the moment that I

372
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,223
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

373
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Or maybe the kid was a piano

374
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,879
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

375
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Or maybe the kids in math class

376
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,743
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

377
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
We're interested in the

378
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Epic moments where

379
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
A kid does something super smart

380
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
It doesn't have anything to do with

381
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
If you have a story

382
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
Go to radiolab.org

383
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Flash brilliance

384
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Mrecorder short

385
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Audio message

386
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
And that's radiolab.org

387
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Flash Brewing

388
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Thank you so much

389
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,119
Jad Robert Radiolab I were back with David, and this new

390
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Do do us

391
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Way

392
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Changing

393
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Life

394
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
Infective heredity

395
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
These leaping jeans these transfers of

396
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
DNA

397
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
That create

398
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
New genetic possibilities

399
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
In a blink

400
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Turns out David told us that the swapping of genes but we talked about in the early history of life that's still happening

401
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Today correct

402
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,719
Yes bacteria all around us those bugs

403
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,047
Are trading jean jeans are jumping sideways

404
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
From one kind of

405
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Bacteria

406
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,679
To another Even in our bellies Even in our guts

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
So let's say that you go to France

408
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Vacation

409
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
And then you lick your finger

410
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Are you eat something

411
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
New bacteria

412
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,831
European food has been into your stomach and now not only do you have some new bugs in you

413
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,951
But they can start trading their Gene with bugs that are already in you

414
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:19,071
What would that mean like physically like what it would look like without the cell wall and then

415
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
They found that there were several different mechanism

416
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
For this

417
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
Two bacteria would create a little pipe

418
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
A little sort of penis like thing

419
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Between them and genes would be transferred

420
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,895
The jeans were moving sideways under other circumstances

421
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
2

422
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
From

423
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,063
Dead busted open bacteria into live bacteria does it acquire this new

424
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Trade at once immediately

425
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
Amedeo in an instant

426
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Anu population

427
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Even the news

428
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Species

429
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,303
Of bacteria can possess all of those

430
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Gradually laborious Lee

431
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Acquired adaptations that

432
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
Another strain of bacteria evolve they don't have to wait around

433
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
For Generation after generation to pick up

434
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Random mutation

435
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
Are bacteria inside us can pick up

436
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:09,759
Kuiu abilities new tricks all at once from your new neighbors so Princeton's one kind

437
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Of bacteria

438
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
Could pass jeans

439
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
4

440
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,440
Antibiotic resistance to another completely different kind of bacteria

441
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,512
So you got somebody sitting in a hospital with

442
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
A a staphylococcus infection

443
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
Some of the bugs inside her figure it out

444
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,936
How to resist penicillin

445
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
Bugs in comes out of

446
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,848
That human and it gets left on a table in the hospital and somebody else gets infected by it

447
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
Then they will also have

448
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
An infection that is resistant to penicillin in the hospital sick with something

449
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
Show me different they have a different kind of harmful bacteria do in trouble giving them trouble

450
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:52,256
And those old bacteria in them can learn in a Flash on the new bacteria

451
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
Now everybody's penicillin-resistant

452
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
And that's why

453
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
That's what I antibiotic resistance

454
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
Is spreading around the world

455
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
So lickety-split

456
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
That is really important that's a

457
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
That's a global Health crisis

458
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
The World Health Organization among others

459
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
Have called that a global Health crisis

460
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
Tens and tens and tens of thousands people

461
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
Are dying from Netflix really important

462
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
An urgent

463
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
The most important part of this

464
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Whole subject is not

465
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Practical

466
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
It's a matter of understanding

467
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
Understanding the history of life

468
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Understanding

469
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Who We Are

470
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:32,960
Literally because according to David the way we are the humans are has been affected by

471
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,824
Visits from other creatures genes yes 8% of the human genome

472
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Is

473
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Viral DNA

474
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:45,248
8% of the humans or into our mammal ancestors

475
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Sideways

476
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
It's like you're sitting around enough virus gets into your bloodstream

477
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
And it travels into one of yourself

478
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
And when it's in there and drop some of its DNA

479
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Enjoy your day

480
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
And if it gets new Dory sellers principal then it will be passed along 8% of our genome has come to us that

481
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
That way from these viruses

482
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Some of that

483
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Is just

484
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Gobbledygook

485
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
In our genome

486
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Some of it

487
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
Is instructions not with jeans

488
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
That are still performing functions

489
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
And one of those

490
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,040
Create boundary layer between

491
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
Human placenta in the fetus

492
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
An absolutely necessary

493
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Sensual

494
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Boundary layer

495
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Now this is

496
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
He was totally shocked to me because after all the thing that's

497
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,376
Really special about mammals is that female mammals

498
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
Or at least placental mammals

499
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
Carrie young around inside

500
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
The body in the history of life this was a completely new development I mean you think about fish you think about reptiles like the dinosaur

501
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
The birds

502
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
What are they doing to him

503
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
If they lay eggs but now we get a creature

504
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,856
The comes along and figures out how to keep the baby growing inside it

505
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,440
Question what does that have to make sure that it gets immune system.

506
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
And the baby has to be able to

507
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
Poop and stuff like that get things out of that to be some kind of

508
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Boundary

509
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
And how did we get that good idea

510
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
We got that good idea from a virus

511
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:13,312
Long long ago some ancient mammal ancestor got a virus got infected by a virus and not virus

512
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Introduced a new Gene

513
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Is the original virus it created an envelope a rapping

514
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Around the virus

515
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
But

516
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
It has been

517
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Adapted

518
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
To create a different kind of rapping

519
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
The rapping that goes

520
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
Around fetus and inside the placenta

521
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
So it carries nutrients

522
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,864
In it protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and it is allowing waste products

523
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
From

524
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
Fetus to be carried away

525
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:45,568
And disposed of by the mother I mean is this potentially the origin of mammals and woods

526
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,664
This being the without which if we hadn't gotten this Talent from viruses

527
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
We wouldn't have gotten

528
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,296
The kinds of mammals we have now that layer

529
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
Could not exist and does not function

530
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Without this

531
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
Viral Gene

532
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Telling it

533
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
What to do

534
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,536
Without this little bit of a virus DNA

535
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
Yeah you can't be a mammal

536
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
You can't be my mother mammal and you can't be a child

537
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,848
In light of the stuff in in

538
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
For me and light of five years of

539
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Studying

540
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
I'm following it in interviewing people about it

541
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
The categories that we apply to the world

542
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Categories like

543
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Individual

544
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
And

545
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Species

546
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Now appear more blurry

547
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
The edges

548
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Are fuzzy

549
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Is there such a thing as a human individual or is it

550
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
A human a composite

551
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Of other forms of life

552
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
And what this says is that we are composite

553
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
We are mosaics

554
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Sis humbling and it's

555
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Bennett's fascinating

556
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Just think of yourself that way

557
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,600
Like for me David so it turns out that David is not just the descendant of

558
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
A Norwegian father and a German Irish mother

559
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
But he's also

560
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Viral and bacterial

561
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
And who knows what else

562
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
End

563
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Thrilling

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
I'm grateful to all the limbs on the tree of life for the things that they've given us

566
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Thanks of course to Steven strogatz of Cornell University who is always willing to jump

567
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Back into the pond so he's long since I left and thought he'd gotten dried off from David Clements new book

568
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
Book is called the Tangled tree and it's a gorgeous book so thanks to them and takes all of you

00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
