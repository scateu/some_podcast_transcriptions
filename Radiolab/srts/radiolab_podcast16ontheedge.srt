1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,816
Forget started

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,120
We could ask your help on a little

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,400
Little something so

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Couple questions

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344

15
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368

19
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Wait wait

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,360
Radiolab WNYC

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,736
Okay so then if

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
How we can introduce this how would you convince

23
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
The many people listening

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,488
Listening great story doesn't matter that it's figure skating it's like a really good story it's a good story that like

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
What's off of it's like I'm Jedi Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and I've never been a huge

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
Savannah figure skating but like this story

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
I think asked a really interesting question

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
The question would be

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
What if you

30
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
With all your

31
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Wanted to be

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
The best of Sade

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
But the persons

34
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
To judge what's the best

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
It's something you want to do don't share the best mess with your sense of business so you do your best in their best in your best or different

36
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Now you can't

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
What are you doing

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Story comes from our producer life

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232

Okay so let's start van

42
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
It's okay so we're starting in 1998

43
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248

Probably her laugh

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Go

It was joined this performance bit Surya bonaly did something that had never been done by

66
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904

As a as a kind of middle finger at The Establishment like it's huge

68
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:48,192
Oh my goodness

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Just as beautiful

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Moment of self-affirmation what you do

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Lookbook

72
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,016
Hello

73
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Hello how are you doing

74
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Pretty good thanks I laughed out loud when I when I heard you say that you would call me on your Zamboni break

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Idles like it's only time

76
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
Really understand just the context of

77
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
At all this and the six of that that moment

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
But we got to go all the way

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,032
How did you how did you first get in the skating well I did

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Suffocating because

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
Of my mom actually I'm so sorry it was actually adopted

82
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
As a baby

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
By this white couple in the south of France

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
She grew up in nice my mom was a sport coach

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
And she was able to be

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
Like a volunteer for a gymnast

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
She club and Skating Club

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,072
So even though in our small tiny tiny

89
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,424
She just put me on the eyes and say hey just hang around and chill on the ice and

90
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Spend lots of hours

91
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Waiting for my mom

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
And one day I guess I find out that's a hot

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
Some skating boots

94
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Fit me

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
She started

96
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
Fortunately I was good at 8

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Pretty soon

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
She had two coats from the local ring I guess a coach can of cold and having meeting with your parents say Hey you know it'll be nice if you could come

99
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Like two times a week

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,655
Let me know will be nice. Maybe four times a week while how about everyday

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Here we go

102
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,079
Age of 10 she decides she wants to spend her life figure skater it was my dream to enough

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
To do it and I know I can so she would go lead Ice shows like holiday on Ice the One S is a show I love zucchini

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
I love you too

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Showtime and just so you know

106
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,463
Fantastic costume see with the Aldi's Dana skaters. My eyes grew on those skaters

107
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:51,839
Flying through the air I thought it was like amazing but you would go to practice and she would practice

108
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,679
All of the things she saw that the double axel and triple toe loop

109
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,263
Spit gemz towels in the double salchow

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
And that you know quadruple double the triple Axel do you have any idea what you're saying

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,039
These are all just words to me it was very fast at improve. Every week every month you can see a difference

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And speaking of different

113
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
You know if we fast forward a little bit

114
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
And here she is on the world stage Surya bonaly in 1989

115
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Careers at the world championships

116
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
The thing that becomes really apparent is that she is

117
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Different yeah

118
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
Because I was black so that people like what

119
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
French black so I'm black and

120
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
I definitely remember

121
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
When she was about to skate my mom would be like

122
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,855
The black roller skating so we all have to like pay attention and so

123
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
People's South

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Can a

125
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Curious

126
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Is very different

127
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Start with some

128
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
It was arrested that Janet Howard espn.com

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Getting an exotic figure on the ice she is just arrested her eyes when she stated that the contrast of her skin on the ice was

130
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
And then there were these fanciful stories that

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Sprung up about

132
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,807
Where she came from as far away as possible

133
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
Pretty much as soon as she hit the scene you started hearing these rumors that she had being adopted from a coconut

134
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
Trend beach in reunions island off the coast

135
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
Madagascar an unlikely place to find a world-class figure skater and that she had

136
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Fitbit

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,335
What was it she never cut her hair

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
Herbert existed on a diet of birds

139
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
She didn't eat all these things

140
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Siri says you know at that age

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
She really didn't know

142
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Too much about what was going on

143
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
And all your kiddos like whatever my coach till it's you know he's the one who speak

144
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
She barely speak English

145
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
16

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
Young baby I did talk to the guy he was

147
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,799
Coaching her at the time this guy named Didier Guy gay

148
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
And he told me he planned to be

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
We use

150
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Depressed very well

151
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,807
Play was he said that he made up the beach thing he made up hair thing because he was trying to

152
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
She was a star

153
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
And what do you want to hear

154
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Stories

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
So we made some Stars

156
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Some good ones

157
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Do you know what I mean

158
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm just saying that we making up stories

159
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Because you want to hear

160
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
That is

161
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah you're absolutely right it's kind of see where he was going because

162
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
What he was trying to do with that he was trying to present her to the world

163
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
As is like

164
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Radically new kind of

165
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
Because female skating at that moment

166
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Where nice

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Cute girls

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Especially for ladies they like to

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
To keep little girls pretty famous skater like Katarina Witt

170
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Katarina vet

171
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,631
Oh

172
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
Woman in those pretty graceful Nexus mens

173
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
Sinnoh crazy when they were watching it

174
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
They were also

175
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Why

176
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
How would I say

177
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Baby has a sudden

178
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Conception

179
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
A female

180
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
We didn't have

181
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
It wasn't just that she look different

182
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
She also

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Skate it

184
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Different

185
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,767
It was a totally different approach Surya was always very like

186
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Closest Elvis stojko is in the building

187
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,031
3 time world figure skating Champion for me it was sort of new

188
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:50,431
When you face on the scene, is the still like the fresh ticket young tiny fifteen-year-old French kahoot

189
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
Everyone's imagination to hear Tonya Harding Style skating is so exciting

190
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
Just no boundaries for her this is Tonya Harding

191
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,791
And she answering over friends strengthen the power except on the ice

192
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
People are crazy

193
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Take off Surya would go from one end to the other hits speed across the online

194
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
Soaring through the air

195
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
What powerful spin Institute

196
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Combination

197
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Combination to do pretty spread eagle

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
And shoot attack

199
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Everything is a reference to step sequence she had the the gliding

200
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,103
Running

201
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
She had it all what cloud here appreciate it

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
This sucks jumping ability and there's no end to what she might achieve

203
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,999
Outside of competition should be revised shows and exhibitions

204
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
And that's when you would see like whiskey

205
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Can really do just do all kind of other jump

206
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Backflip

207
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Yes very first time that I ever saw her do a backflip I mean I just my mouth just draw

208
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
Dropped open that's honey Harding again I was like how did you do that cuz it's really dangerous Elvis stojko

209
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,759
Joe told us that one time he tried it and it did not go well

210
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
I came down right on my face

211
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
And I split my eye open

212
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
And almost broke my neck and I was like

213
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
You know I don't think this is going to be a good thing and just a little teenage girl Surya bonaly no problem

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Just doing it like it was nothing absolutely Fearless

215
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,727
And the crowd loved it. Making noise in table fit

216
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Into the grown

217
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,895
I can feel like the whole building building I'm like I swear it looks like an earthquake but

218
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Here's what

219
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
And this is where things can I get

220
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Felix

221
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,623
3 blows up and all these people who never like figure skating fall in love with her

222
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Over and over

223
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
The judges don't artistic impression when you can see this Terry from

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,447
And the crowd do not like amox

225
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Even with

226
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Doesn't get high scores

227
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
No

228
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Begin to flow

229
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Have it all the time I skate dude

230
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
But somehow I

231
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
It's not for me in figure skating goes from Z

232
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
0 to 6

233
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
And on Syria's artistic marks

234
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Get scores like

235
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
05

236
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,095
Yeah you get your low five would you like sounds like it's a good Market but that's not a

237
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:53,471
What did you think about Mark

238
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
Very very disappointed

239
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
She said nevermind that's life

240
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
I'm used to it

241
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Excel Sports

242
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Sportsman challenge

243
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Everyday I try to do the best

244
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Lava kudu

245
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
You do your best

246
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Is fine

247
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
But clearly there were some times where I got her there was this one time we found on YouTube where she

248
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,839
Cabooze the judge

249
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
What her she gets her

250
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Why was she getting bad marks

251
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
To begin with what

252
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
What was the problem

253
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Well that's the question and it's

254
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
Kind of complicated yeah I think there's

255
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Several things John Howard

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
That ESPN writer

257
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
The first thing you got to know and

258
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,855
Quick little dive into the weirdo world of figure skating

259
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Is that there's this

260
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Fundamental tension

261
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
In the sport of figure skating between

262
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Artistry on one side

263
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
In athleticism Monday

264
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Powerful Mistress of prettiness

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
Slate they want these people to look like little ballerinas but leap into these jumps

266
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Looks like

267
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
Predators at the time Skating was sort of

268
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Locked in the

269
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Loud and fracture

270
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Debate about

271
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
What do we want to be

272
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
And

273
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Sorry I was sort of the epitome of

274
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
Almost the endpoint what could happen

275
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,159
If somebody with unrivaled athleticism and no aversion to risk

276
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,023
Was willing to go after it and I think there were a lot of people in the skating that didn't want it

277
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
I went through it

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
I know all about it

279
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,959
Tonya Harding's she said that she had this issue I didn't want to skate like what they wanted

280
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Skating to look like

281
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Elvis stojko two-button

282
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
Surya's case a lot of work to be done on my car

283
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
There's a lot of books

284
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,735
To be done on the grass all those words used to criticize her skating Salat 36th

285
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,575
I'd like to see your stop jumping for 6 months and learn to skate

286
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
We just a little bit more loaded

287
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,487
Baby taken glyco brought a lot of raw talent

288
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
But it's not

289
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
It's not fully kind of

290
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
I can be refined and

291
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
For us like none Skeeter's like that's one of the challenges of the story I guess it's like trying to see like

292
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Is Zazzle legit

293
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Criticism

294
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Is this just a way of

295
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Saying that

296
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Cease

297
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Black Beatles

298
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Westies

299
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
I have the courage

300
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
How to say because she was black

301
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
This is Marie Wren Laguna and she is a former French figure skate

302
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
And she was part of it

303
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,231
Team whose job it was to decide which girls to send to

304
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
World junior Championship

305
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
And we have to choose to only two girls and we had

306
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Three possibilities

307
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
She said that she backed

308
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Surya

309
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
The majority of the

310
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
The people do don't didn't want the black

311
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Cato's

312
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Were they saying it out loud like we don't

313
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,295
Want somebody don't want her because she's like it was a very subtly inside

314
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
According to her what they would say she levitated kind of things like

315
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
She's too muscular or she wasn't elegant enough

316
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Oh yes

317
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
I have to say that

318
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
That's what Elegance many times I have heard that

319
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
She's not there

320
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,191
Marie Wren is an outsider in the figure skating World these days because of an unrelated

321
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Scandal and so we weren't

322
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Totally sure what to think about that but

323
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Wait how did

324
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Sorry I feel bad

325
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Well I asked her

326
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,431
Did you feel like any of the difficulty was because you're black

327
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
No

328
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
No no no

329
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
But then moments later she said

330
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Well

331
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
I know

332
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
When you go black you know

333
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,487
Everybody knows that you have to do better than

334
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Anybody else was white

335
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Well

336
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
I think the idea that she was held back

337
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
In Martin her mark

338
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
For any other reason other than

339
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
The quality of

340
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Skating I think his

341
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Incorrect

342
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
That Sandra bezic

343
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Has been involved

344
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Skating World my whole life as a

345
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Competitor is in

346
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Olympian

347
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Commentator

348
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,063
And actually as a commentator I'd like to see your stop jumping for 6 months and learn to skate

349
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
She was kind of hard on Syria

350
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
And when we asked her why

351
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
This is what she said everything about

352
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Skating is built on

353
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
The radius could be huge but it's

354
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Phyllis Circle

355
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Everything is about edges

356
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Leaning into those edges

357
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
And leaning into the

358
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Returns

359
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
And in carving

360
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Massive circles on the ice

361
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
And that is

362
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
R-sport

363
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Which

364
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Leads to Syria

365
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
And if you want to jump starter

366
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
They were on straight line

367
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
And

368
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,159
If a jump is on a straight line then it can't land with

369
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Blow

370
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Because the idea is

371
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Tool and you jump

372
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
With as much

373
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Evenflo is you

374
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
You had going into it

375
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,679
And that's something that she couldn't do because she was jumping on straight line

376
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
And in the other thing about skating that you don't necessarily get on

377
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Is the sound of yet

378
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
The sound of

379
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Of a beautiful

380
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Skater going for

381
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Edge-to-edge from lean-to

382
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Celine

383
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
What is that sound like

384
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
It's a beautiful sound

385
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
It's a sound that we all love

386
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
It's a gentle carving

387
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
No no no no

388
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
No because

389
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
There's no there I can tell you

390
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
There are no scratches

391
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
It's a Glide

392
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
It's just that it's a ham

393
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,231
Is there a different sound to me like there's a sound of Brian Boitano's back crossover

394
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
You know used to

395
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Like excite me when I was in the rink with

396
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
But then there's also

397
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Sister did the gentle almost

398
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Soundless

399
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Quality of

400
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
So you can saute

401
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Katia gordeeva

402
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Weather like a witch

403
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Farrah Fawcett

404
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
I said yet there

405
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
In a flipping from one address to another Edge

406
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,551
And forward to backward and it's

407
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Almost

408
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
It's just a

409
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
This

410
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Glide

411
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
I haven't got a good word

412
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,815
Damn it's a win-win 3 was hitting would she have that sound

413
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
No

414
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
She would be

415
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Scratchy

416
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,639
Now we should say that wasn't the sound of Surya skating or any of those other people we just like

417
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Mic'd up a whole bunch of

418
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
Like pretty good figure skaters with a professional skin yeah yeah yeah these are legit scared

419
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Reset the clip

420
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
What is Sandra at

421
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Since you gave me the thumbs up

422
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:44,351
Do we got a ride or whatever it is she is hearing and think yes I sound different

423
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Not even that different really so that's exactly the problem ice skating is largely about aesthetic

424
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,359
So as far as it's like kind of in its own category

425
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:00,223
Like if you're talking about Serena Williams is facing a lot of these same kinds of criticism

426
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,855
It doesn't matter there's a line on a court and it's either inside or outside There are rules

427
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
Where is there aren't these rules

428
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
When it comes

429
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
The beauty it

430
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
It's super slushie

431
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
And that makes

432
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Someone likes

433
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
Surya much more vulnerable

434
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
So what so what ended up happening

435
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
Well after a couple years of getting these kinds of marks

436
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
See

437
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Best insults

438
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,151
I mean I was born March 1992 at the age of 18

439
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
I have new car garage

440
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
Change my whole skating rules you know I change poachers

441
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
And she decides to take the note

442
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,951
Jackie travel to California and works with Frank Carroll who's like this legendary American coach

443
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
And what you doing

444
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
Trying to be no

445
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
B

446
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,167
More graceful more beautiful more elegantly mohr Circle yeah

447
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
And

448
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
After that you kind of

449
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
You can watch the Youtube videos from that. And if

450
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
It's like she's a

451
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Does it work

452
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
Yeah in 1993 in the world championships

453
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
She comes in second

454
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,599
And then by the time I'm a 94 rolls around she is a favorite she is she busy

455
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Probably going to win

456
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
And

457
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
What happened

458
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Things take a risk

459
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Estranged

460
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
Will be back right after the same Bonnie Brae

And

471
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
I was really curious what

472
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,720
What happened at that at that medal ceremony in 1994

473
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,352
Iaaf world championships

474
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,728

Justice at the world championship

477
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Are the second most important event

478
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
And at the Olympics

479
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856

Chan luu got the bronze

482
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Sports please

483
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
What's urea

484
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
Now those top three ladies

485
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
Oksana Nancy Liu

486
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Out of the picture

487
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Injuries

488
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
Some turn pro in

489
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,080
Whatever point is at these World Championships

490
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,944
The the highway had been cleared for Surya she was going to take it

491
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,064
Is a purse for the ticket

492
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
So jumping forward to the final day of the champion

493
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
Surya is in second place

494
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
60 years old

495
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
From nice

496
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
South of France

497
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Start the program

498
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,520
Immediately starts with his double axle occur incredible after that is just

499
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,920
Triple triple triple triple triple

500
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
One of the baskets of her life I know I did my best I did everything it was not perfect because nobody's perfect but pretty good

501
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Good condition overall eventually after about four and a half minute to finish

502
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
Escape json loads and loads of testicles

503
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,960
The question is how will I see her artistic after

504
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
And she goes over

505
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Beside to a bench

506
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
With her coach

507
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
To await her

508
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Results

509
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,000
S59 goes are as high as any we've seen

510
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
How to get your marks

511
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,632
She jumps in the first place and then and there's only one skater left

512
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
It's a skater who usually finishes below three-eyed comedy

513
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Yuka Sato

514
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
Again that's Sandra bezic we all know you could

515
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
The smile on you

516
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
Your face Nuka was you know one of these really

517
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,112
Lyrical skaters painting is return Elvis stojko and you can have it

518
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,440
How does very beautiful

519
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Chipper skating

520
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Gentle almost soundless

521
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Quality

522
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Like a whisper across the ice

523
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Physically hurt

524
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Skating style was the exact opposite end

525
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
From Sirius

526
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,824
21 year old son Tokyo

527
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
So she gets up does her final skate in for the home crowd

528
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
My favorite skaters but she doesn't know she's going to need all her jumps opening up

529
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
XXX

530
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,256
And she gets her first jump

531
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Crowd loved it and me but she was prettier

532
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
It in her routine there were these moments where it just

533
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Looks like some sort of skipping

534
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Crusty eyes

535
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Just very balletic moves

536
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
It's good to know

537
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Just one here at makuhari event center 4th the local favorite Lucas

538
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,840
Songs to Sato of Japan orbitalia France

539
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
You know get off the ice she goes to wait for her marks

540
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
Birthmarks of course for technical Merit bowling alley strength osako stated

541
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,664
And every one of those marks except the Finish judge

542
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,504
Go to bowling alley she wins 8 out of 9 technical Merit

543
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
The light came down to the artistic mark But the French judge

544
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
Giving her higher marks

545
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
What this is going to be closed

546
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
It actually ends up being a tie

547
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
So it goes to being a timer

548
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,032
And that's been the the judges basically pick for 2nd and 3rd

549
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
And in a 5-4 decision

550
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
The new world champion

551
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
Unfortunately the truth hurt

552
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
Medal ceremony

553
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
What happens next is

554
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,632
One of these moments that really defines serious story for a lot of people

555
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
So what happened was that

556
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,776
Right after all the results were out

557
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
He set up the medal ceremony they called out

558
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Skaters they first

559
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
Called-out yuca

560
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
She comes out from

561
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
Tunnel backstage under the ice

562
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,296
What about waves Smiles everybody

563
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
And then

564
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,440
After about a minute

565
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Syria

566
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
But

567
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
Where is the European Champion all the cameras Friday around and

568
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Timeout

569
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Not an idiot

570
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
How late arrival and here she comes

571
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Cheapskates out

572
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
Santa dice

573
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
She weighed but her faces

574
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Smiling

575
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,344
No and then when she gets to the podium she congratulates you Casado

576
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
But then

577
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,720
Finally has chosen not to stand on the podium

578
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
She just stopped before getting on the podium she just stood right

579
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Next

580
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,656
I think this is a form of protest

581
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,032
I really hope she doesn't go through with this she wouldn't stand on it she was crying

582
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,336
Elvis actually was in the crowd watching

583
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,408
I feel bad for her cuz I know what she was going through

584
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Where

585
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,712
You know you out skated

586
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,760
Your competitor and they just wouldn't give it

587
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
And I was like Siri adjust

588
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Get on the podium

589
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Take the metal

590
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,232
International skating Union president Olaf

591
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:48,352
Official is giving out the medals he gives you cuz of gold put it around your neck

592
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,728
But then when he turns to Surya he just sort of

593
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,336
Stands there looks at are you said something that you can't hear what it is

594
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
She shakes her head

595
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
What's the metal around Serena's neck

596
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
Shakes her hand and he holds her hand and it's kind of like

597
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Is her off the podium

598
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
This is a first for me that's for sure

599
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
Takes off the middle

600
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,472
I'm not sure if she takes

601
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
It's over metal off of her

602
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Had

603
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Play call my God he's actually doing this news huge

604
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
It was huge he was a huge deal

605
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
The camera Zooms in on her face and and she is just

606
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
What's going on inside

607
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,696
That young woman

608
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
So after the medal ceremonies over

609
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
She just gets mop

610
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
Why would you not accept what was the problem

611
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,104
I'm just disappointed

612
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
What are the judges unfair to you

613
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,528
You're saying

614
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
Did you deserve the gold medal Syria

615
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
And eventually what she says

616
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
Is I'm just

617
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
And I'm just not lucky

618
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
What what was going on like what happened you use I seen was more like a plan Jose is this it it stop now

619
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,056
Can you put your fist on the table

620
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Enough is enough.

621
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Say Hey you know

622
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,016
I'm not dumb and I'm just getting sick and now I'm sick of it. I keep my eyes open that is not fair

623
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
We have those task. I was just sold

624
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Depressing

625
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
And was so not fair mostly it was not fair

626
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
What about it felt unfair

627
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Joseph Savino

628
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,328
Up and over and over so many times that's every time

629
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
It's never me because whatever I can do how many people I can be pretty I can have the best choreographer I can so everything was made

630
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
To be on the top

631
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,336
I'm like what do you need more me to do I just want

632
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
You know how many triple-triple you want me if I don't do you kill me

633
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
And if I do

634
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,016
You don't care anyway you took somebody choose somebody else

635
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Don't you think

636
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
But that's a little

637
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Unsportsmanlike

638
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Yeah totally absent

639
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah but if she's other girls have to work just as hard as she has one cuz UMES

640
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
Sure but okay so picture yourself if you're at that

641
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,216
Is it your you're in that position you find yourself getting second second you feel like you're not

642
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,800
You're not she came in second that always had the margin with

643
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
So close

644
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,432
It was so close

645
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
I just more like soap empathy for heart for her

646
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
Can't imagine what it

647
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Be like

648
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Like anime

649
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
What atmosphere

650
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
But you know in that kind on that scale

651
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
To be the only one

652
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
Xerosis

653
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
Anything for you know

654
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,312
A friend of mine once told me that racism can make black people crazy

655
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,920
Which is very very broad way of looking at it

656
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:19,808
In the sense that you kind of almost never know why people are reacting to you the way that they do

657
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,624
And it's it and it's kind of a

658
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
You're always sort of second

659
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Guessing

660
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
You know what's up

661
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
You know that

662
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,376
Did they go that guy just came and he said hi to everybody in the room but he did say it to me

663
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
What is that what was that

664
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,520
There's no obvious thing about it but it can make you feel

665
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,336
A little paranoia a little

666
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
Crazy now I cannot

667
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
Put myself I can't imagine how

668
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
YouTube Sevilla felt in that moment

669
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
But I didn't necessarily like think that you know these

670
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,416
Prejudiced people had denied her this if anything I felt more like

671
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Man

672
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
It really must

673
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Skating at that kind of level

674
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
And not really understand

675
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Why

676
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Things Are

677
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Gormiti

678
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
It must be like a very confusing

679
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Situation to be in

680
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
And that is in and it was more like empathy

681
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Don't know

682
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
You know if if if if

683
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
There was racism

684
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,392
Quite frankly Yuka Sato is an amazing skater it's very legitimate

685
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Feel

686
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Like you

687
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
Put your finger

688
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
Never goes away

689
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
No

690
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Never

691
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Always there

692
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
And always

693
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Happens what happens

694
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
That's a pretty

695
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,760
I think that I think the the wreck that she got after this moment was that she was a sore loser

696
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
And that she was Define

697
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
That

698
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
She had a bad attitude

699
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Does she

700
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Quit at this point

701
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Well she keeps going

702
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:07,328
She competed again in the world championships in 1995 the very next year she came in second

703
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Again again

704
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
3 years

705
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
In a similar pattern was there like

706
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Just the 100

707
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
That one wasn't as close

708
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Second again for the

709
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
I think seriously no European championships you know Skate America

710
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Is doing a lot

711
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
Not at the Olympics not at the world championship

712
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,768
But I guess it depends on how you define

713
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Find First

714
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
What do you mean he said that actually takes us right back to the beginning

715
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
We're here live at 10 a.m. on Saturday morning in Japan

716
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
So bored but

717
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Remind

718
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
Where in Nagano Japan

719
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
1998 Winter

720
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
I knew it was my last Olympics in the last

721
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,344
Major major big competition and everything was fine until the day before

722
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
The short program

723
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
I pulled a muscle

724
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Her left

725
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
And I couldn't leave

726
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
I can do anything

727
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
To make matters worse Surya. Moment was already recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon

728
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
To carry me

729
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:23,360
To walk stairs because I couldn't get there so you have to leave me to go to my room because you're not doing a village

730
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
I couldn't walk

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,296
You know even broken I'm damaged I'm like a used car that's really good good for Life trash

732
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
I'll let you know really I was so messed up

733
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Between my legs

734
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
But in my achilles I was like

735
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Nas the disaster

736
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,608
And the doctor said maybe we should withdraw and I know I'm already here and I don't want to

737
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
To trust me retires my

738
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,704
Probably my last option I don't want to dress

739
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Metallica

740
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Just give me anything you can

741
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
I have to keep going

742
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,104
And so on the final day she says that she

743
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,200
Between May DC massage acupuncture Hills

744
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
She goes back out on the ice

745
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
And is now getting ready to skate

746
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
For her country

747
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
Golden blue

748
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Sequins outfit and

749
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
She starts her

750
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,232
You can tell she

751
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
Favoring one leg but she manages

752
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
Didn't work for the Telco

753
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Get back up

754
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Going through her routine

755
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
Triple sow-cow

756
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
And then she said

757
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
Chillicothe this point where

758
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
She couldn't do it

759
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
It was so much in pain

760
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,112
I hadn't oceanos program I was supposed to go

761
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
But you know what I don't feel it I know I'm going to crash I can do I'm not capable

762
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
My leg is not

763
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
With me anymore

764
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
And then what comes

765
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
There is this movie

766
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
House in a repertoire that you

767
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Can do

768
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
But it's illegal

769
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,056
A special thing in my backpack and say hey I can't do it

770
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Is my last

771
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:02,176
Is molluscum t-shirts or going through your mind was you were skating

772
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:07,296
Yeah oh yeah you know me is like a computer if you know if I would have missed something or dramas okay here

773
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
I can see the triple here

774
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,952
I was there I can do a combo triple triple I know I need to feel something you're like the GPS lady you're like recalculating

775
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,632
Turns around from getting forwards to skating backwards

776
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
Picks up speed just like she's about to do triple

777
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,336
But she does

778
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Backflip

779
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
But not any old backflow

780
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
Sheetz Wings on leg over

781
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Blitz

782
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
In the air

783
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:43,136
Upside down and then she lands on one

784
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:49,536
Oh my goodness

785
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
What is it when you do the backflip do you go do your skates go up towards the ceiling and then come back down underneath you again

786
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,288
I just am having trouble Avenue

787
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
Because it

788
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
It's so dangerous

789
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,992
Also she says you're supposed to land all your jumps on one foot

790
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
But she did that

791
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
You didn't want photo just hold hold I just want this whole

792
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,792
And couldn't be like totally illegal because they are as long as laying on one food maybe we'll be

793
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
We will sing about

794
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,800
And she finishes her program with her back to the judges

795
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
And you know usually is it you skate you perform you smile in front of the camera but was it gives a mock neck skater

796
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:46,112
Call me to collect 10 minutes seriously 10 minutes people think about what should we do

797
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,256
Do with me and I said whatever just put a zero and so we can move on there or the marks that you get mailed

798
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:58,912
Presentation absolutely 48522 how do you get noticed in Olympic competition

799
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Nope so she ends up finishing

800
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Intense

801
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
I like yeah I finished and it's okay

802
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:15,296
Adele afterwards a lot of people interpreted that backflip as a

803
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
Big fat middle finger up

804
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
To the entire

805
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:24,000
Skating World I know you don't want me to but I'm going to do this anyway

806
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,352
When I asked no

807
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
I don't know what

808
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
I was just trying to

809
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Be happy

810
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
She said she just wanted

811
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
Something that was her

812
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Yes

813
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
Yes I had anyone ever done this

814
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
Backflip onto one blade before

815
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
No

816
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
No no no I'm the one who created this one

817
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
His wife is a Benelli

818
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,648
Oh that's what I'll do

819
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
The only one who did it

820
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Wow

821
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,816
You're the first person in the history of the human race who has done that

822
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
So I'm not going to with a jalapeno

823
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,704
I'll be able to die in peace don't steal my backpack it's mine

824
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
This mine

825
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
So I'm just

826
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Kings like what is happy

827
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Story end

828
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,480
Well as she retired from figure skating after

829
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
The 98 Olympics

830
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
She continues

831
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
What to do

832
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Isozaki

833
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Occasionally

834
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:27,232
But right now I think the main thing that she's doing is she's coaching she was in Minnesota

835
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
And she's coaching and skaters yes

836
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Black women weed

837
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
Ask people like oh did she

838
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
She

839
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Did she changed

840
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
The sport

841
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
Did she change figures

842
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Answer the

843
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Giving

844
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
No

845
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
Oh she did

846
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
You know sound like all of a sudden

847
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,736
Ito figure skating rinks across the country but across the world are flooded with

848
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,832
Little black girls learning their sock house in their Lexus and things like that

849
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,136
I will say for my

850
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
From what I can

851
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Until

852
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
For the first time that there are

853
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,024
There's more than one

854
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Black

855
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Skater

856
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Competing

857
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:10,240
At the same time internationally at least by their backflips

858
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
They are still

859
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
So

860
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
This is sort of like

861
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Almost

862
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
This way to blip

863
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
On the skating

864
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Where's he was just

865
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
You know no one would like her before

866
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,208
And there hasn't really been anyone like

867
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
But there is this kind of ironic

868
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
I guess we just did

869
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
If

870
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
You took her and

871
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
NNU put her in competition

872
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
Today if she was

873
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Competing on the world stage

874
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Today

875
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
She would

876
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Probably do better than she

877
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
She did back then

878
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
They've changed the

879
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,968
These are the scoring systems hope so now

880
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,504
You get points

881
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
For doing the kinds of power moves that

882
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,928
She was doing way back when and and even if you if you spill even if you fail at those moves

883
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
You still got

884
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
You get points for trying

885
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Yeah

886
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
For daring

887
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
And Syria was

00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
