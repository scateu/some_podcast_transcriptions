1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
Hate this is Radiolab

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm at Walters

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,856
And today we have the fifth episode of our mini series

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
G

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,304
Last episode we had a story from Google Miller about eugenics

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
All about scientists who were applying the darwinian idea that species can be shaped by natural selection

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
Too Human

11
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
Like instead of waiting for nature to choose which individuals

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
Of the human species were most

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
A quote-unquote

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
They thought

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,480
They could speed things along

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
And in the process

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Create like

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
A perfect human

19
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Which I as we got into last time was

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
I did after

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488
And at a certain point Lulu argued that these eugenicist

22
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
In emphasizing

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
There one narrow idea of

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
Perfection over everything else

25
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
They sort of missed the point of Darwin Darwin talks about

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
1

27
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,872
Sing this one ingredient that he Marvels at he doesn't understand why it's there

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
The thing to which we all

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Oh

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Existence on Earth

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Variation

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Variation

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
What makes a species resilience

34
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
Is differ

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
But that's a very selective reading of Darwin

36
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
Turns out not everyone agrees with her it is true of course that variation is really important to evolution

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
But it's variation coupled with selection that actually gives you

38
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Success so

39
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
You know I disagree with

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Her interpretation

41
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
So not too long after we talked to Lulu

42
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
I I did an interview with a scientist

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
Who takes a very different

44
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Aficionado

45
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,344
And he's come into a bit of controversy

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Some people argue

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Betty's

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Taking those

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Old ideas

50
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,560
That certain people can decide which humans are fit enough to exist

51
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
And which ones aren't I think it'd be very careful because

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,960
Nobody here is trying to optimize

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
One specific trait or number what we're doing is identifying outcomes that I think most people agree

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Free maybe are not good

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
And arguably he's walking those ideas

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,344
Into the future hello

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Okay to backup a Beat

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Hello

59
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Hi is this Steve

60
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
Yeah this is Steve this is Pat

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Hey Pat how are you

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
This is

63
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Steve Schuh

64
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
I'm a

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Theoretical

66
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
Physicist who also works in computational genomics

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Steve in his early 50s

68
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
Has short black hair little wire rim glasses

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
And he says he's been interested in genomic

70
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
The power of DNA

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah actually so when I was a kid. I watch too much TV

72
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Is that right

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
Yeah this is 70s there was no parenting going on

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Things were so laissez-faire back then and so when I went home in the afternoon if it's the very favorite

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Thing I would watch

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Was

77
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Star Trek the original

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,752
Star Trek with William Shatner as Kirk and Spock

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
And in the Star Trek universe in the late 20th century

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Engineered intellect

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
How to survive they had these so-called

82
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
Eugenics Wars

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,832
In which some genetic Supermen were created

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Check out who is this man

85
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,488
Bite technology

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
What do you want with us

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
They were smarter and more capable and they almost took over the Earth and all that was quite Vivid in my mind when I was

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Was growing up and he says

89
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Elsa made him Wonder

90
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,872
Steve like lots of kids growing up in the 1970s had to take an IQ test at some point

91
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
End

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
He says he's bored

93
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Really high

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
Like in the top 99 percentile

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Any bathroom self

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Why is that

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
Am I getting better vitamins is it cuz my mom and dad

98
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
You don't make me go to bed early at night

99
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
Is a city environmental causes that are making me

100
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Different from my peers or is there something different about my DNA

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Mrs. Pete

102
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,727
At one point took this question to his local library I found this whole section where they had book after book

103
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,103
About studies done on identical twins how they measure IQ or are they measure cognitive ability

104
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
So I just it was

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
Very Stark in my mind that something about our DNA

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Could influence

107
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,319
The power of effectiveness of your brain

108
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
This was

109
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
Dope that late 1970s

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
And at this point science just

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,511
Wasn't quite ready to tackle those questions in a serious way

112
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,095
At that time we had no way to actually directly measure DNA

113
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And even by the time I was in college

114
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
We had not

115
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
We're nowhere near being able to sequence a human genome

116
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
Soap Steve went in a different track

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Went to grad school for physics

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,431
Said well I'm going to work on black holes and Quantum field Theory because

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
Where are you know we would take a huge technological breakthroughs for us to make

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Progress on these questions

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
In my lifetime

122
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
But

123
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,231
It wouldn't take as long as he thought yes

124
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Speakers

125
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
15 years later

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
This is when roughly this was

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Mm

128
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
June 26th

129
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
2003 back

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Good morning

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
The moment we are here to witness was

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
Just brought about standing beside podium in the East room of the White House

133
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
President Bill Clinton announced

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,319
We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey

135
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Of the entire human genome

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
More than a thousand researchers across Six Nations

137
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Have revealed nearly all 3 billion letters

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,143
About miraculous genetic code Eastside come to fruition

139
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,007
Search Project huge advances in our capability to

140
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
Read out somebody's DNA and along with all these advances Steve watch as the price of a

141
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,735
Soda for Human Genome was sequenced at a cost of 1 billion dollar

142
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Dramatic

143
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Today the cost

144
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Does Pell Grant decrease

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Genomic sequencing

146
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
$47,000 in a roundabout $1,000 cost of genotyping

147
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Is going to come down here I realized wow

148
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
It is amazing how this rapidly

149
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
444 is born even conceived ideas about genomics and

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Genetic engineering will come true

151
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
And if I get to be one of the scientists

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Who makes real

153
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Some amazing trope

154
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
From science fiction that would be the most awesome thing in the world

155
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Maybe thinking

156
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
I was anyway

157
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,887
At me Steve Mister point about Star Trek episode about the Eugenics Wars

158
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
But

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
That was his interpreter

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
So

161
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
Those thoughts were in my mind when I thought what is it going to take

162
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
For us to figure out

163
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
The genetic architecture of human intelligence

164
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Still around 2011

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Steve started to Pivot from physics

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Did you know me

167
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Just hoping to find a portal

168
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Secular

169
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Place in the genome

170
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
That was influencing your say IQ score

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
But now

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
I'm Diane Sawyer

173
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Tonight on 60 Minutes

174
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Even if team ran into a problem

175
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,215
You mentioned the human genome in all of the things that it was supposed

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Do

177
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Ashley

178
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
A lot of people have been this

179
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,383
Pointed genetics turn out to be way more complicated than a lot of people thought of

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
Because way things were promised and it hasn't really happened

181
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
It was definitely oversold an initial hope had been like let's find the one gene causes

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Best rate

183
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
And the one mutation that causes

184
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Is that disease

185
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
And I in the early years scientists found a few of those sort of one to one

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
But

187
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Only if you

188
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Failed to turn up

189
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,799
You know some of the Hidden connections they had expected to find or they turned up stuff but then it couldn't be replicated

190
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
The same within a decade all human diseases would be cured

191
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Not too many of them. That was kind of the

192
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
The first

193
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Face this is Megan molteni I'm a staff writer at wired and explain to us what they found was that

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,303
Became clear that most traits in human beings are caused by a single gene or even a handful of genes

195
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,655
They often arrive out of the complex interaction of hundreds

196
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,799
Thousands or even tens of thousands of genes and other bits of DNA working in concert

197
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
So the challenge sort of shipped

198
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,943
It was about finding a single gene or mutation for any one thing

199
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,807
About mapping the huge after the genome and looking for variation

200
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
And so we realize we need many many more phenotypes

201
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
And much much more data

202
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
And so

203
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
How the address that was

204
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
Dexter began banding together into these big International Consortium to pool together data and dial up

205
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Statistical power for everyone 2017

206
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,479
Public Square 23andMe provides contributions

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Their data into the mix and so by the summer of 2018 they're comparing the DNA of 1.1 million people

208
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
Japanese giant data set that essentially launch

209
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
This next wave

210
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Genetic study

211
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,191
Yes that is the data set that has been studied to produce predictors

212
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
And that kind of brings us to

213
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,079
Can I bring the city's genome-wide Association studies

214
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
Explaining these can get pretty complicated but the basic ideas

215
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
But that you have a bunch of talk

216
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
People and you want to find out what makes them tall

217
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Genetically

218
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
So you take the genomes of all the top

219
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
People billions and billions letters

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
And you feed that data in Turkey

221
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
Computer that scans all the buildings flat

222
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
And it looks purple

223
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Like what do these people have in common

224
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
And computer might say like

225
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
A bunch of them have a certain mutation at

226
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
Spot 270 3674

227
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,431
And a bunch of them also have mutation in spot 920 3672

228
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
And another mutation is about 38000

229
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
I'm just making

230
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
App

231
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Steve actually did this an hour

232
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
For height and the

233
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
AI algorithm identified about

234
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
20000 different

235
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Locations in your genome

236
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
That

237
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Determine tight

238
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
At least informed

239
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
20000 spots in the genome that have

240
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
Some influence over how tall you are

241
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
It is

242
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
This is called

243
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Training docker

244
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
And went to train

245
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
What's its found all of these pattern

246
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Once it has figure all that out

247
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
You can men do

248
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Is prediction

249
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
For people that have never seen before

250
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,719
So what you do is you take the Genome of someone knew what we call out of sample data

251
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
This person is not involved in the training and feed

252
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Gestageno

253
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,167
This guy have a RB at this location how about at this location how about at this location

254
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
You at 20000 x

255
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
End of the fing world

256
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Predict

257
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,567
This guy's going to be 6 or 2

258
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Wheaton in how accurate exactly is this thing

259
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Well so we recently just a year-and-a-half ago so

260
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Succeeded

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
In

262
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
Building a predictor which has an accuracy of about

263
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Plus or minus in

264
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
That's pretty amazing

265
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
Yeah and we don't know like what those genetic variations

266
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
Doing we just know that

267
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Computer said there's something different happening

268
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Indonesia

269
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Places

270
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
I pray the taller people then for the other

271
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
That's correct

272
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Avere eyes are almost like Black Box

273
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Does you train them

274
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
And then you got to carefully test them but once

275
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Once you validate that

276
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
My God

277
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
The Lord

278
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Are the Martians just came and gave me this black box which does

279
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
This thing

280
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
It predicts height

281
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
And not just

282
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
We have a pretty good bone density predictor turns out that's pretty heritable

283
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Things like

284
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,351
Diabetes atrial fibrillation

285
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
Breast cancer prostate cancer

286
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
So you can you can do us

287
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Like literally anything

288
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Again

289
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
Cheney

290
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
So where this gets

291
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Interesting

292
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Is

293
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
That

294
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
Perhaps unsurprisingly just in the last

295
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Years

296
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Steve Hsu starts wanting to

297
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
Use these genome-wide Association

298
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Study is

299
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
As a way to

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Predict

301
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Intelligence

302
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
Intelligence is a complex

303
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Straight so we know there are genes involved

304
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
We know there are lots of them

305
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,191
But environment so where you grow up even how much you get to eat like all of that matters

306
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
2 but decent dozens of studies

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,567
Lockman tenant wins when it comes to intelligence

308
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,687
Or cognitive ability basically whatever we want to call what an IQ test measures which

309
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
As we know how is it going to take

310
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,343
The evidence that we know today suggest that genes are responsible for somewhere between

311
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
20 to 50% of house market

312
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Bar or

313
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
How we can house how we can measure

314
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
What we call in Telugu

315
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,375
And so that gives you hope that if you had an update at your AI algorithm

316
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Figure out

317
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
I had a crudely predict

318
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Cognate perform

319
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
From from your genotype alone

320
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
No Estes allowed to do that

321
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
The first hurdle community in Renton

322
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
She was only a fraction of the 1.1 million

323
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
People

324
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
In the study

325
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Had

326
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Peace Corps data available

327
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
And without that it would be

328
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Serving pasta

329
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
How to predict someone's IQ

330
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,231
But nearly every Jewish researcher on the planet was collecting

331
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Educational attorney

332
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
And that's just the number of years that people have been in school they did that is like

333
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Person that got nice

334
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
School diploma or a PhD

335
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
I am with Steve and I actually a bunch of other res

336
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Searchers would eventually figure out

337
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Is that the genetic pattern that predict

338
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Educational attainment is actually

339
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Very good at predicting IQ

340
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Earthquake comprable

341
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Flash Forward

342
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
2 today

343
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
We have predictors for cognitive ability that correlate

344
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
About 23 or .4

345
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
With actual

346
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
IQ score

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
So just put that in

348
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Correlation

349
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
1 means the computer would be able to

350
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Predict the IQ score

351
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Exact

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Every time

353
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
I'm based on

354
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Genetics alone

355
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
Correlation of 0 means computer base

356
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Physically beat guessing

357
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
At random

358
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
2.3

359
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
2.4

360
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
I bet like that doesn't

361
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Team very high to me.

362
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Directions to

363
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Pretty low analogy

364
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Let me give it to you this way

365
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
If you admit a bunch of

366
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Kids to college

367
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
And you have their SAT scores

368
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
You can predict their GPA in college

369
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
And the correlation between those two variables

370
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Is also about point

371
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
Got so we're kind of at that level of capability from

372
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Pure genius

373
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
The way Steve

374
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Using

375
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
That predictive capability

376
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
At the moment we are out

377

379
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
That's where I start to get cold

Epic rock break

382
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967

397
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Look at Walters

399
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Back to my discussion with Steve Schuh

400
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
So you also have a company yeah actually it's a it's a tech startup with invest

401
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Stirs Venture funds and

402
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
You know wealthy individuals

403
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
What's your company called again

404
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
It's called genomic

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Genomic prediction

406
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Prediction

407
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Okay

408
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,183
And you you're starting to apply these things you've discovered to

409
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
Two testing yes by testing for embryos

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,375
First of all the embryos were talking about here are the ones that were produced through IVF

411
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
IVF

412
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Speedo basically pass to baby

413
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,311
Take a little sperm and egg combine in a Petri dish for later transfer

414
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,175
So every year about a million babies are born worldwide

415
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,759
Using IVF a million I didn't realize was that high

416
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
It's about a million worldwide

417
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
And that means are actually many millions of embryos produce

418
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
Because when you do IVF you often produce

419
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
More embryos then you end up using

420
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Which means that oftentimes what IVF couples face

421
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Is a choice

422
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
Which embryos to use and which would be the best to use

423
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
And so

424
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
It is now common to do genetic testing on those embryos

425
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Typically really basic

426
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
The most common thing right now is just a

427
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,991
To test to see whether the number of chromosomes is normal to screencast down sin

428
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
Relatively simple test that is by far the most common kind of genetic testing is done

429
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
But now though if you think of the technical breakthroughs that I described to you you can you can screen against

430
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Much more than just down syndrome

431
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
And so the company that we started

432
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:18,495
Takes the same standard biopsy that's already used to do the chromosome count screening but takes it a step further and

433
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
And actually sequences a chunk of the Genome of that

434
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,943
And we can then applied all of the genomic predictors that I described to you

435
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
To an embryo

436
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
So the doc might say

437
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Embryo number 4 looks like

438
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Stephanie can have type 1 diabetes

439
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
Umbria number 3 has a very strange outlier for heart attack

440
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,047
Etcetera etcetera and applying the information you have about

441
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Intelligence

442
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Today's embryos in this decision

443
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
As well

444
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
So that's the most challenging

445
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
Question that's the one that everybody wants to focus on

446
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Because we can do it

447
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
But you know it whenever journalist contacts me

448
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,039
Even if the person I know has an unhealthy fixation on IQ and doesn't want to talk about all the help

449
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
Positive health things

450
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Associated with this technology

451
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
Just wants to focus on the one thing that

452
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
You know everybody gets heated up about the end

453
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
But yeah I still want to have the conversation because Society needs to understand what is actually going on

454
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
So

455
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Our current policy

456
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
And we arrived this after really a lot of

457
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Thought

458
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
And not wanting

459
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
To get out ahead

460
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
Of where Society is on this

461
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
The only thing that we report

462
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
About the intelligence of

463
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
The individual embryo

464
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
Is if the embryo is an outlier

465
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
In risk for

466
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,463
I think the medical term is

467
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
Takacs what is it is it a mental disability

468
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Something like that

469
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
I think it's

470
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
Intellectual disability intellectual disability

471
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
And that

472
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
The predictor would be

473
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Saying that it's likely that this embryo would have a

474
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
And IQ score below a certain number yes I think intellectual disabilities

475
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,991
Probably something like IQ of 75 or something like this and

476
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
It would mean that

477
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
The IVF physician will get a report

478
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Saying

479
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,695
Embryo number four has a very unusual

480
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Large number

481
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Of the variance

482
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
That

483
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Depress

484
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Intelligence

485
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
And I think that's a reasonable thing to want to know

486
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
Is there a parallel track happening in your mind

487
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
Because the other

488
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,383
People who had gotten excited about making super people besides the science fiction people are like

489
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
The Nazis

490
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Oh yeah

491
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,527
You know the idea that you would

492
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,367
Dehumanize some people because they're less able

493
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
Is extremely dangerous

494
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:50,559
But this notion that all we shouldn't do any of this research because there was a guy called Adolf Hitler

495
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
That's kind of crazy

496
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Tumi

497
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:03,103
We every technology really powerful technology weathers AI or genomics or nuclear energy

498
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
They have

499
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Risks it's always the case

500
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Sure but I

501
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,527
I guess I don't trust the IQ part of it like

502
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
Pretty well-established that I

503
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
The IQ score isn't a good way to determine intellectual disability like I think it's way

504
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Be more complicated than that

505
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,120
Right but keeping my none of this is a sure thing in the sense that we're not saying

506
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
That we know

507
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Embryo three

508
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,752
Will have IQ below 75 we're not saying that

509
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Purchasing the chances

510
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
The child

511
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
We'll have a lot of difficulty

512
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Modern society

513
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
That probabilities elevated

514
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,320
I guess I this is me where we disagree is that like I don't I'm not convinced you can know

515
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,672
What's the quality of someone's life is going to be like based on

516
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
And I cute

517
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,280
We're talking buddy that what you saying that conditional on that

518
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Score

519
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,632
If I go out in the population I look at people with that score

520
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
A lot of them have not

521
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Had

522
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Very

523
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
You know I think positive lives

524
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,080
And I'm pretty sure that most mothers when they're pregnant

525
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
When they go to sleep at night

526
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,992
They're not dreaming about that outcome their dream about another outcome for their children it just feels like

527
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Bad idea

528
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
The only question here is

529
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Imagine that you are

530
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
Sister is going through IVF

531
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,768
And you happen to have the genotypes of all the embryos of your sisters

532
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Potential kids

533
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
And you find out who a embryo for is predicted

534
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
To be

535
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
In less than the 1st percentile

536
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
For cognitive ability

537
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,616
But all the other ones are in the normal range or maybe even above-average

538
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Would you tell your sister

539
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
I mean that's the basic

540
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Question right

541
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,648
Who anyway we're going to make some kind of brutal decision like okay these two we implant

542
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Those 8 we donate to science

543
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
Yeah right so it was going to happen anyway

544
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
2/8 of their 10 embryos

545
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Right so

546
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
The thing is

547
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
If we can help your sister with little bit

548
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Let's Help

549
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
That's my attitude

550
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Ind2

551
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,104
I also want to emphasize that typically the embryologist will actually just look at the shape

552
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,760
Mike did the cells grow in a nice symmetrical pattern they just literally look at the shape of it and say like

553
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
That one looks nice yeah with your sister rather

554
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Go with the gut

555
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Feeling based on the shape

556
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Or would you rather go with

557
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Some genetic evaluation

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Well I don't

559
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
I don't know because

560
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
It's probably really hard for parents to know like

561
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
The really interpret that information they might just hear 75 and then here

562
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
You probably intellectually disabled I don't want that

563
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
And I think

564
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
That freak me out

565
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Yeah I do think the

566
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
We need really good genetic counseling

567
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,296
So the people understand the world that we're entering into

568
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,440
Because again no one's saying that embryo for is going to have IQ below 75

569
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
That's extremely bad that that's actually not the message

570
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
The message is that the risks are a lot higher than for all your other embryos

571
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
That's always

572
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Well

573
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,056
But as for what a lot higher really means I mean there's different ways of quantifying

574
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
The strength of the prediction

575
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
The way to interpret it

576
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Is it's a good

577
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Predictor

578
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
On average and that's what makes it useful

579
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
In research

580
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
I talked to this guy named Dan Benjamin

581
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
But in general

582
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
It's not a good predictor at the end of each what level

583
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
He's a professor of economics

584
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
At USC and one of the founders of that big Consortium of scientist social science genetics associate

585
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
Consortium that help pull together the million or so genomes that Steve's genetic IQ predictor is effect

586
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
If we built on

587
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
And he says

588
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Think about that comparison Steve made to the SAT

589
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
You know it's very hard to predict who's going to do while in college

590
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
And SAT scores are

591
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
Among the better predictors of that like

592
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
On average

593
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,696
The kids who score well on the SAT

594
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,792
Will do well in school but I mean if you look at a

595
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
University

596
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,680
You boys seen your grade point average yet there are going to be some pretty poor performers

597
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
And you might ask yourself

598
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:21,664
Why did the squirrel admit those students shouldn't they have been able to tell

599
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Go students

600
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
We're going to do

601
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,344
Praying and the answer is they couldn't tell

602
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,672
For any individual person SAT scores

603
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Are not

604
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
A good predictor

605
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
There are just too many

606
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
Other things that

607
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Matter

608
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
And justice

609
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Shift away from the sat back to like

610
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Using a polygenic score to try to say something about an individual

611
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
If you had to

612
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Quantify

613
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
What not a very good production meet how did you do that

614
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Well if you pics two people

615
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
Randomly

616
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
In the sample

617
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
And you asked

618
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
How likely is it that

619
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
The one with

620
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
The higher polygenic score

621
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,440
Is actually the one who

622
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
.

623
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
More

624
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Years of schooling

625
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
The answer is

626
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
About 60%

627
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
60%

628
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
Yes there is a 40% chance

629
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
That you'll get it backwards

630
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
And more to the point

631
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
You know in the context

632
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
Embryo selection

633
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,176
The prediction is most likely to be right it's going to be something like

634
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,992
Reducing it from 60% to 55

635
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
So according to Dan these predictions can be useful in large groups

636
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,392
But on an individual level

637
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
They're just a little bit better than a coin toss

638
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
So

639
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,280
I worry that companies that are offering a service

640
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Exaggerating

641
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
The potential gains

642
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
And also

643
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Are not being

644
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Upfront

645
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
About what the risks are

646
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Two things on that real quick

647
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
First dances

648
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:59,456
Because we don't really know how the genetic variations that predict IQ score really work

649
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
If you select against them

650
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,064
You might accidentally be selecting for others

651
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:09,952
Like mental illnesses or certain diseases are are these risks and we don't even know what all of the risks are

652
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Number two

653
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
Which might even be bored disturbing

654
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,912
Dance has the genetic data all of this is based on

655
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
Came only from white people of European descent

656
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
I think they can get their hands on

657
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,896
Consequently if you try to use at a test like Steve shoes

658
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm someone who's not a white person of European descent

659
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
It pretty much doesn't work

660
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
That correlation

661
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
Drops to the floor

662
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,464
So even the possibility of doing it is pretty much limited to

663
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Well off

664
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
White people at this point

665
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Insulin Steve

666
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Thrift stores with this comp

667
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,984
That the genetic predictor is pretty much like the SAT

668
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
That's just not the whole story

669
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
For complicated

670
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
And what worries me is that you know you have

671
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Guys like

672
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Dan Benjamin

673
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Advocating for this

674
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
You no more

675
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,528
Complex understanding of what

676
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
Statics really mean

677
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
You're saying they're being funded groups

678
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
They're not meaningful and individuals

679
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
You on the other side you have

680
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Steve story

681
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Which is

682
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
It's just so

683
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,680
A straightforward and compelling and you know it's Steve story and dance story

684
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Happy face off

685
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
I just feel like

686
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Steve's will win every time

687
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Story of Stow

688
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
Simple it does feel like

689
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
In the end what you're able to tell someone

690
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,064
Like isn't that much because it is in a one-to-one predictor or even really

691
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Close to that

692
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
Well it will get better

693
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,256
I guarantee you as we get more data the predictive power will get much better I think it will eventually

694
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Achieve a kind of

695
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
Capability kind of like what we can do with height

696
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Where are you you know that the error is about

697
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
I need a maybe plus or minus 10 points of IQ

698
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
You know I will say that

699
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Mega miltank

700
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
Right now while he may

701
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Be an outlier

702
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
In terms of what he's willing

703
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,832
To offer based on kind of where the models are now I don't think he will be an outlier

704
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Furlong

705
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
The

706
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Information is going to become available and it's

707
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Only going to it's only going to get better

708
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
And of course there are many ethical

709
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Things that we have to

710
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
It's sort out and I think different societies will decide different things about

711
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
How they want to deal with this

712
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
And so

713
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
You know if a particular country

714
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Said

715
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
We do not want you to ever

716
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Report

717
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Anything about

718
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Cognitive risks we just don't want you to report that

719
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
I would totally respect that

720
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
But then I think you have to read

721
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Respect

722
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
If the nation of Singapore

723
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
If they decide this is an important thing to do

724
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Will you better respect them too

725
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,768
Otherwise you're some kind of racist

726
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
Colonialist guy who says only my ethics

727
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Count

728
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
So I realized I eat I realize the NPR audience may not like it but

729
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
This is the world that we're entering into

730
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,592
Have people used to act like has the

731
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
Predicted tool been used by

732
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Consumers yet

733
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
So

734
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
They're different

735
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Segments

736
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
To the

737
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Product

738
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
The full-blown thing where you report

739
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,744
Genetic test scores polygenic scores for variety of traits

740
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,560
Is in the process of being used

741
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
What is the process mean like

742
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,216
Well I eat I'm not ready to report the birth of Annie

743
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
Child or anything but let you say samples have been analyzed

744
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Okay

745
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
And it's been that information provided to

746
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Couples

747
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,808
I don't know that I can comment on exactly

748
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Any specifics

749
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
Along those lines I'd probably have to check with RCU

750
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,936
When I staying just the other day as we were finishing the story

751
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,288
Steve roach rosson said that while the company has provided brisk reports

752
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
Do IVF doctors

753
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
For various diseases like breast cancer and diabetes

754
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
They have not quote

755
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,808
Given a report warning of high risk for intellectual disability

756
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Yet

757
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,184
And at the end of this

758
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
I find myself thinking about

759
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,816
The thousands of couples out there who are doing IVF

760
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,424
And the thousand more who will do it in the years and decades ahead

761
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,824
Honestly wondering like

762
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,688
I would love to use any name they want to know

763
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
Cycle early stages of IVF cycle 1

764
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
You can tell them

765
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
A really hard question

766
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
Feel uncomfortable

767
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
I think I would have a lot of anxiety over that.

768
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
You sure that is

769
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Not that act

770
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Brilliant

771
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
Healthy

772
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
I don't see what harm

773
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
We would need to ask

774
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Before we would ever

775
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:28,160
I would probably want to know you want to know but then you're looking at a world where

776
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
People who have a lot of money

777
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
The Lacs

778
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,072
For the ones who are more intelligent are offered to me and it wasn't

779
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
Prohibitive

780
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
It is something I think we will test for before we do our next round he's probably will do

781
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,664
I don't think about it long and hard

782
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Question

783
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
