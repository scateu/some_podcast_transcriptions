00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
Where our culture is going

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424

Radio WNYC

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Hey I'm Jared I'm rodheim Robert krulwich Radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
And by the way there's going to be a smattering of curse words here that we're not going to believe I think makes sense given the content of the story

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
And also there's some

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Graphic scenes

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Stat

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192

00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
Might want to anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
District start in 2008

75
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Sure how about with a song

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384

77
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Bmac Facebook

78
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Rise up

79
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
I stopped and put back on

80
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
So I December 27th a sunny Saturday morning that this group of young to

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Middle-aged women gathered in Downtown Palo

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
That's awesome

83
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
They're wearing these colorful hats

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,664
And are singing and swaying directly in front of the glass door at headquarters of

85
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Facebook

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Is there a song called

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
Yes

88
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,976
Was a humble Gathering of a few dozen women and babies

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,119
That right there is one of the organizers of the Gathering Stephanie Muir

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
What do you call an event Facebook nursing

91
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Nursing as in like

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Breastfeeding

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
The intent was really just to

94
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Be visible

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
And be peaceful

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
And make a quiet point

97
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
Waterway point

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
Are they trying to make Stephanie in this group of mothers you know they were on Facebook as many people were

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
And they'd have

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
Photos taken of themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies

101
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,559
They wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to face

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
These pictures

103
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Would get taken down

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,263
And they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading pornographic content

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
And people work

106
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
Really getting their backs up over this

107
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
They wanted Facebook to stop taking their photos

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
To say that will nudity is not allowed

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
Breastfeeding is exempt

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
.

111
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
Android backup

112
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Now

113
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
What

114
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
Stephanie couldn't have known at the time

115
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Was that this

116
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Small

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Peaceful protest

118
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Turn out to be sporting a Faceoff on Facebook

119
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
One of the opening shots

120
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Facebook trigger The Hornet's Nest and what would become a loud Rock

121
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
View Facebook

122
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,063
You and Global battle

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
And now I'm not talking about

124
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
All the things you've recently heard about

125
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
Russian interference in election meddling oreda breeches

126
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,839
But but rather something that I think is is deeper than both of

127
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
Free Speech violence against what we can say

128
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
And what we can't save Facebook

129
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
Fondear

130
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Thank you mr. chairman

131
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Mr. Zuckerberg I got to ask you

132
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
Do you subjectively prioritize or censor speech

133
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Congresswoman

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
We don't

135
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
In trouble for doing a sensory

136
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
But there are

137
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
What what what really grabbed me was

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Who is discovering that

139
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Underneath all of this

140
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Is

141
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
An actual rule book

142
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Apex

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Document

144
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
That dictates what

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
I can say on Facebook

146
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
What you can say on Facebook

147
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
And what all 2.2 billion of us

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,703
Can't say on Facebook for everyone in the entire Globe one set of rules

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
That all 2.2 billion of us are expect

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,359
The following is an actual document it's a digital document

151
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
It's about 50 pages if you print it off

152
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
And I

153
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
In bullet points

154
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,295
And if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment

155
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
For the glow

156
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Which

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Made me wonder

158
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Like

159
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
What are these

160
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
How were they written

161
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
And can you even have one rule book

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Right exactly

163
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,399
I don't into this world book and dug up some stories that

164
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Really

165
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Put it to the test

166
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
Okay I'll I'm going to sleep now. We're going to hear 3 ish

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
Okay okay give me to send the issue but that's go ahead with let's start back

168
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
On that morning in mm

169
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
The morning that you could argue

170
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
Started it all

171
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,927
Cuz in the building right behind those protecting mothers

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
There was a group of Facebook employees

173
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Sitting in a conference room

174
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Trying to figure out what to do

175
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Cool so if I

176
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
So I'm just going to

177
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,983
So I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees

178
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
One of them was actually in that room at that moment

179
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,943
And now neither of these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
Extensively house that will that take work for you

181
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Just so we have it

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
So what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did

183
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
With these two different former Facebook employees

184
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
All right ready

185
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
So

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
At the time when I join them there was a

187
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
Small group 12 of us mostly recent College grads Integrity team again

188
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Keep in mind this was in the early 2000s

189
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
Change this week in the internet hierarchy deep dark

190
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Myspace.com

191
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Is now the most visited web

192
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Us

193
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
Facebook head somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million users

194
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
We were smaller than Myspace

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
The vast majority of them College

196
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
And so in those early days those 12 people they would they would sit around in a

197
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
Conference like room with a big long table

198
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,519
Each of them in front of their own computer and things would come up onto their screen flagged to Facebook

199
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
And I like meaning like I a user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you

200
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
You think violates

201
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
The community standards this is Kate klonick she's a professor of law at St John's in in she's been a lot of time studying the

202
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
This very thing

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
And in she says in those early days what would happen is

204
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
A user would flag a piece of content and then

205
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,887
Fat content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room

206
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
It would just pop up on their screen

207
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
Most of what you were saying was either naked people

208
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Blown off heads org

209
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Things that there is no clear reason why someone had reported cuz it was like a

210
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Photo of a golden retriever

211
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
People are just annoying

212
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,599
And every time something popped up on the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision

213
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
Whether to leave that thing up or take it down

214
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,279
And at the time if you didn't know what to do you would turn your pod leader who was you know

215
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
Somebody who'd been around nine months longer than you and asks

216
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
What do I do with this

217
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
And they would either have

218
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
Seen it before and explain it to you or you both with knowing you

219
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Google something

220
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
It really was just kind of an ad hoc approach standard or any common standard

221
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
They had a set of community standards but the thing at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long

222
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,463
It was not very specific guidelines were really one page long there one page long

223
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
And basically all this page said was

224
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Nudity is bad

225
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
So is Hitler and if it makes you feel bad take it down

226
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,751
And so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture

227
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
Pop up on the screen in front of them

228
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
They be like

229
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,175
I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down

230
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Until

231
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
Rise up fight for the rights to have breastfeeding

232
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Anyway

233
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Now a dozen or so people in front of their office

234
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
This is on a Saturday

235
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
It it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache

236
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
But I thought

237
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
You know hey we have an opportunity here with you know over 10000 members in our group

238
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
According to Stephanie mirror those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group

239
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Who had organized

240
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Clean up

241
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
So to coincide with the live protest I just typed up a little blurb encouraging hour

242
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Members that were in the group

243
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
To do a virtual nursing

244
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
A virtual nurse

245
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Right

246
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
What we did

247
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
They posted a message asking their members

248
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
Two for one day

249
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Change their profile Avatar

250
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,935
To an image of breastfeeding and then change their status

251
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
To the title of our group pay Facebook breastfeeding is not obscene and it caught on

252
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,735
The social networking website is under Fire for its policy on photos of women breastfeeding their children

253
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:11,135
Thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in

254
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
Hundreds of interviews for print

255
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
Chicago Tribune Miami Herald Time Magazine we are X Washington Post

256
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
What is an interesting phenomenon

257
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
It was a media storm

258
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
And

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Eventually

260
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Perhaps

261
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
As a result of our group in our efforts

262
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Facebook

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Was

264
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
Forced to get much more specific

265
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
About

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Their rules

267
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
Soap for example by then nudity was already not allowed on

268
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
But they had no definition for nudity

269
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
They just said no nudity and so decide Integrity team that does 12 people at the time they realize they had to start

270
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Spelling out exactly what they meant

271
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Precisely

272
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
All of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to

273
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
Define nudity so I mean yeah the first cut out it was

274
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Visible male and female genitalia

275
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
And then visible female breasts

276
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
And then the question is

277
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Well okay how much of it

278
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
It's me showing before it's nude

279
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,855
And the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and areola

280
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
The nap nudity

281
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
And it would have to be taken down

282
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Which

283
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
Theoretically at least would appease these protests

284
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
Because you know now when a picture would pop up

285
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Of a mother breastfeeding

286
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,751
As long as the child was blocking the view of the nipple in the area let they they could say cool no problem

287
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
Then you start getting pictures that are women with just their babies on their chest

288
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
With their breasts

289
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Bear

290
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:43,807
Like for example maybe baby was sleeping on the chest of a bare-breasted woman and not actively breastfeeding

291
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Like is this actually breastfeed

292
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
No it's actually not breasts

293
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
Spitting the woman is just holding the baby and she has her top off

294
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
No but she was clearly just breastfeeding the baby

295
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
Well like I would say

296
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
But I would say it's sort of like kicking a soccer ball

297
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Like a photo of someone who has just kicked a soccer ball you can tell the ball is in the air but there is no contact between the foot

298
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,431
And the ball in that moment potentially so although it is a photo of someone kicking a soccer ball they are not in fact

299
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
Kicking the soccer ball in that phone became the procedure or the

300
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
Get the protocol of the approach for all these things

301
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
We have the basic

302
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Shirley on what we can see in the image

303
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
And so

304
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
I didn't like that to stay up under the rules because it could be

305
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,423
To easily exploited for other types of content like nudity or pornography

306
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
We got to the only way you could have ejected Lee say that the baby in the mother were engaged in breastfeeding is if the baby's lips were touch

307
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Touching a woman's nipple

308
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
So they included but you can call like an attachment

309
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Closs

310
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
But as soon as they got that rule in place

311
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Like you would see you know a 25 year old woman and a teenage looking boy right and like

312
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,999
What the hell is going on there oh yeah it's gets really weird if you like start entering into like

313
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
Child and I wasn't even going to bring that up cuz it's kind of gross

314
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,167
It's like breastfeeding p*** other sites like the currently

315
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,543
And so this time they realize they needed to have a nudity rule that allowed for breastfeeding

316
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
But also had some kind of an age

317
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,991
So then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy then we believe that it's inappropriate

318
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
But then pictures would start popping up on your screen and they'd be like wait

319
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Is that an infant

320
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Like where's the line between infant and toddler and so the thing that we landed on was if it look like the child could walk on his

321
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Cizeron

322
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Then to all

323
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Big enough to walk

324
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,191
To bigger breast

325
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Yeah and

326
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:42,079
Like the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like 18 months or two years

327
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Which

328
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Mets

329
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,943
There were a lot of photos still being taken down

330
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Within

331
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
You know days

332
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Sweep it

333
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Continuing to hear reports from

334
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
People that

335
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
Their photographs were still being targeted

336
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
But

337
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Facebook did offer a state

338
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
You know that's where we're going to draw the line

339
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
And keep in mind through this whole episode

340
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Is this perhaps the next big

341
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Facebook.

342
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,567
Cam the company was growing really really fast

343
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
And they're just got to be a lot more content

344
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
500 people

345
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
100000 sub who knows where we're going more people are joining Facebook everyday

346
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
60 million user so far 200 million by the end of the year and now War people on Facebook

347
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
Not just within the United States but also it was growing rapidly

348
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
You were getting in Turkey

349
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Facebook getting big throughout the EU

350
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
Content coming in from all these different places in all different languages

351
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
How are we going to keep everybody on the same page

352
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
And so

353
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
Once I saw that this was the operational method for dealing with this

354
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Creating this like nesting

355
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
Set of exceptions and rules and he's clear things that had to be there or had to not be there in order to keep content up or take it down

356
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Datsun became

357
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Their procedure

358
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
And so dis

359
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
Small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger

360
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
60 people in 900

361
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
And they set out to create rules and definitions

362
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Forbes

363
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Everything

364
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,951
Can we go through some sort of the ridiculous examples with left over here okay

365
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Sogor

366
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Gore mean violence, Gore

367
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
The gold standard was

368
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
Headline we don't allow graphic violence and Gore

369
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
And then

370
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
The shorthand definition that used was no insides on the outside

371
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
No guts no blood

372
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,639
Going out of something what was a separate issue there was an excessive blood

373
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,039
Rule had to come up with rules about bodily fluids semen for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like

374
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
What Does the clinical setting mean and

375
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
You know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat

376
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
At one of my favorite examples is like

377
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
How do you define art because as these people are moderating they would see images of naked

378
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
People that were paintings or sculptures

379
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
,

380
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
And so what they decided to do is say art with nakedness can stay up like it stays up if it is made out of

381
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Made out of metal

382
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Made out of

383
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,991
Don't really yeah because how else

384
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Do you define art you have to just be like

385
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
Is this what you can see with your eyeballs

386
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,743
And so from then on is they run into problems those rules just constantly get updated constantemente

387
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Yeah constant Amendment

388
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
New problem

389
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
New rule

390
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Another new problem

391
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Updated rule

392
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,983
In fact at this point that there are mending these rules up to

393
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
20 times a month

394
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
Really I take for example those rules about breastfeeding

395
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
In 2013 they removed

396
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
The attachment

397
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Claws

398
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Said the baby no longer needed to have its mouth

399
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
Physically touching the nipple of the woman

400
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
And in fact

401
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
1

402
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Nipple

403
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,047
And or areola could be visible in the photo

404
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Only one

405
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
Then 2014 they make it so that

406
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
Both nipples or both areola may be present in the photo

407
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,055
This is what happens in American war all the time just everything

408
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Yeah

409
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
I know it sounds a lot

410
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Like common law

411
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
So common law is this system dating back to early England where individual judges would make rulings which would sort of be a

412
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,391
Law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judge

413
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,511
Soak the body of law was sort of constantly flashed out in face of new facts

414
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,655
Literally every time this team is Facebook which would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight

415
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Apply

416
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,311
Something that they that they weren't prepared for that is that the rule hadn't

417
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,711
As soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about

418
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
For example sometime around 2011

419
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,367
This content moderator is is going through a queue of things

420
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Reject

421
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Escalade

422
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
Accept and she comes up on this image

423
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Oh my God

424
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
The photo itself was a teenage girl

425
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
African by dressing skin

426
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
Breastfeeding a goat's of baby goats

427
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,079
And the moderator throws her hands up and says what the f*** is this

428
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,151
And we googled breastfeeding goats and found

429
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
That this was a thing

430
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
It turns out it's a survival pract

431
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,623
According to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that

432
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
In a drought

433
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Unknown way to help your herd get through the drought is too if you have if you have a woman who's like that

434
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
To have her nurse

435
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,423
The kid the baby goat along with her

436
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Human kit

437
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
And so

438
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
There's nothing sexual about it

439
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,591
Good farming business couldn't and theoretically

440
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
If we go

441
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
Point-by-point through this list

442
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
It's an infant

443
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,111
It is sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there is no physical contact between the mouth and the nipple

444
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Obviously

445
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,744
Breastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Consuming that moment

447
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
What they decide to do is

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Remove the photo

449
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
And there was an amendment and a strict under the rule stating animals are not babies

450
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
We had that so in any future cases people would know what to do

451
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
Foot but they removed they did they discover was culturally appropriate and a thing that people do when they decide to remove the

452
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
The photo yet

453
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
That are aged individuals are a determined wheeler why why didn't we make an exception because

454
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,416
Cuz because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't

455
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
This was not one of those cases

456
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Juice wasn't worth the squeeze

457
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,632
And like if they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was

458
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,264
Is okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay this is a utilitarian document

459
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
It's not about being right 100% of the time

460
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
It's about it

461
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
Being able to execute effect

462
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
In other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be 100% just or Fair

463
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
We're just trying to make something that works

464
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

465
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
And

466
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
When you step back and look at what Facebook has become

467
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Like from 2008

468
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
To now is it 10 years

469
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,360
Xiamen I've just arrived at Accenture Tower

470
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,504
Kerri mennella idea of a single set of rules that work

471
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,856
That can be applied fairly that's just a crazy crazy concept

472
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
1516 because they gone from something like 70 million users to 2.2 billion

473
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
Cartoon pig Camp I would say it's about 30

474
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,680
They've gone from 12-volt sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up

475
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
2 somewhere around

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
16000 people

477
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,384
So there's a floor in this building where the Facebook supposedly outsources content moderators

478
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
It's out around 2010 they decided to start Outsourcing

479
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Some of this work

480
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Places like vanilla

481
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
Where you just heard reporter Aurora on the drawl

482
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
As well as

483
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
Dublin where we sent reporter Garrett

484
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Stack

485
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Scene where they get their stitches Facebook

486
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Everybody's beavering away

487
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
And we sent them there to try to talk to some of these people

488
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
Tube for letting sit at a computer and collectively click-through around a million flag bits of content the pop up

489
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Another screen everyday

490
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
Wow what was just curious like what's what's that like well

491
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Citizen question

492
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:53,344
Found out pretty quickly

493
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
None of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do

494
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
So there's a lot of running away from me happening

495
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
Facebook

496
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
I mean like

497
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
He just came out of there

498
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,688
I know you're lying in fact most people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's up is there something

499
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,576
Wrong about being inside like an NDA that they signed so when I finally did find someone willing

500
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
Willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you know

501
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Or do you not want to be named

502
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
That's totally fine

503
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,496
Explain that he and all the other moderators like and were forced to sign these non-disclosure

504
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
Stating they weren't allowed to

505
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
I admit

506
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
But they work for Facebook

507
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,688
They're not allowed to talk about the work they do

508
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,784
Ernie from talking about

509
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Why

510
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Several reasons one is that

511
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Up until recently Facebook wanted to

512
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,976
Keep secret what these rules were so that it couldn't be gamed

513
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
At the same time at

514
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Create

515
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
A sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want

516
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Monitor graphic images

517
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
Just given the nature of the job

518
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
That's going to have on you

519
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:27,552
I know you got to do this guy I talked to him he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the day

520
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Duration of it about a year

521
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,624
Get you up to theft every morning

522
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Kind of headphones

523
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
Ignore delete

524
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
45

525
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:44,448
5006 everyday

526
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,592
Yeah I was like there's a lot of cases or some other piece of content

527
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Three or four second

528
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,944
Wow all day long all day 8 hours a day

529
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
Well if I can ask what kind of things did you see

530
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
It's true I think it's too x-rated unspeakable

531
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
The magic button to

532
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
13 year old girl

533
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
Having sex with an 8 year old boy

534
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
And it's not just one

535
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,768
When did you did this like keep you up at night and you did this

536
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,264
Wake me up at 9 about these videos photos when he was trying to relax

537
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,384
He had to start avoiding things

538
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
SES

539
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
Exploding

540
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
I have to walk away

541
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
And I just I have to IX

542
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
I I saw that

543
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:23,264
A different moderator I spoke to described it as seen the worst side of humanity

544
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
You see all of the stuff

545
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
But you and I

546
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Don't have

547
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
Because they are going around

548
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Plane cleaner

549
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Yeah good job

550
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
You're in it and it's worth noting that I'm more and more this work is being done

551
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
In an automated fashion

552
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,488
Particularly with content like Gore or terrorist propaganda

553
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,328
The game better than make that they

554
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
Through computer vision they're able to detect

555
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Hallmark

556
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Of of

557
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,312
Are the terrorist video or allegory image and with terrorist propaganda de now

558
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Take down 99%

559
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Of it before anyone Flags

560
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
But

561
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
Moving on to our Second Story here

562
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
That there is a type of content that they that they are having any

563
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
Credibly hard time

564
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
Not just automating

565
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Even getting their rules

566
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Straight on

567
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
And that's running cheats

568
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Oh good

569
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Snorlax coming up well there will be laughter

570
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848
There will be comedians there will be joke. All right

571
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
No I think we're going to keep going okay

572
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3

573
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Simon Adler

574
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
So a couple months back

575
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
I think it's a shame

576
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
We sent our pair of interns

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
Parker Haj

578
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Standing Room

579
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,120
Wicked tickets for tonight

580
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Cramped

581
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
Narrow little comedy

582
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Club

583
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
The kind of place with light

584
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
El Super in Toronto

585
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
$15 smashed Rosemary cocktail

586
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
High top tables

587
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
AC is dripping on me

588
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
But still

589
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Kind of.

590
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
We sent them there to check out

591
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Someone else who found a fault line

592
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
In Facebook

593
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
What's real book

594
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Where to keep it moving right along the next

595
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
Tina, stage

596
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
I guess so

597
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,456
Mad I feel like my person to the city I was such a

598
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Care for you brat

599
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,368
You know I was young and I had these older friends which I thought was like very cool

600
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
And then you just realize that they're alcoholics

601
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Got dark curly hair with razor

602
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Oklahoma

603
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
And I think I was raised Jewish so

604
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,216
Winter is Jewish you read about Anne Frank a lot

605
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
You know a lot a lot

606
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
And

607
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
She

608
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
How did you decide to become a comedian

609
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
You know I was kind of the only thing that ever clicked with me and especially political comedy you know I used to watch the day

610
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,720
Daily Show every day back in 2016 she started this

611
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Political running bit

612
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
But I think can be called sort of

613
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
Absurdist feminist,

614
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
I know a lot of people

615
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
I think that I'm like an angry

616
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Feminist

617
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Which is weird

618
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
Because I am training and

619
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
In the wood

620
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,576
At first I just had this running bit online

621
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,904
On Facebook and Twitter jokes

622
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
You know like we have all the Buffalo Wild Wings around it

623
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
You know things like that eventually took this bit on stage

624
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Even wrote

625
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Shadowsocks

626
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,360
No no not my dad

627
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
So about a year into this running bit

628
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,016
Marshall was bored at work one day

629
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
And logs on the face

630
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,160
But instead of seeing her normal Newsfeed there is this message

631
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
It's that pops up

632
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
It says you posted something.

633
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Discriminated along the lines of race

634
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Gender

635
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
Or ethnicity group and so we removed that

636
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
And so I'm like

637
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
What could I buy

638
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Possibly a Post-It

639
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
I really I thought was like a glitch but

640
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,896
Then she clicked continue and their highlighted was the violating po

641
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
It was a photo of

642
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,320
What is the picture can you describe it to me as what can only be described as a

643
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:58,720
The chair of cute little seven-year-old with big curly hair and she's wearing this blue floral dress her teeth are all

644
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,584
Messed up into the photo Marcia had edited in a speech bubble that just says

645
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Kill all men

646
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,984
As it's fine it's funny you know it's just me whatever

647
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
So

648
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
I thought was ridiculous because she searched through her Library photos and

649
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Found that killallmen image

650
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
I post it again

651
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,528
Immediately after like yeah and it got removed

652
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
Again and this time they were consequence

653
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,184
I got banned for three days after that then after several other

654
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,840
Shoot forward this is months later a friend of hers had posted an article and underneath it in the comment section they were guys

655
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Guys posting just really nasty

656
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
So I commented underneath those comments

657
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Men are scum

658
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Which was

659
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Very

660
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
How long did you get banned for this time

661
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
30 days

662
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Wow

663
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah I was

664
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Dumbfounded

665
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
So there's a rule somewhere

666
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
If I type

667
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Men are scum

668
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
You take it down

669
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Yes

670
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
I'm like what could it be

671
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Inside Marshall called on her quote militia of win

672
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Exactly

673
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
To find out like is this just me

674
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
Female comedians who are sort of like mad on my behalf

675
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,384
Started experimenting posting men are scum to see how quickly it would get remove and if it would be

676
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
Remove every time and it was

677
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
So

678
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
They started trying other way

679
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Fluff yeah

680
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
Did find out where the line was

681
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
My friend put Menard duska that got removed

682
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Men are the worst

683
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,024
Remove the band this one girl put men are septic fluid

684
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Band

685
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
But we're only at the middle of the Saga

686
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
It doesn't end there

687
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
Because now she's really like

688
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
Like what the hell is going on

689
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,568
Is it sexism so I just start doing the most

690
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,640
Bare minimum amount of investigating

691
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:58,784
Cheap Googling around trying to figure out what these policies are in pretty quick she comes across this leak

692
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Facebook.com

693
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
So this is when I lose my mind

694
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,952
This is when Mark Zuckerberg becomes my

695
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Sworn nemesis

696
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
For the rest of my life

697
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,096
Because what you found with a document Facebook used to train their modern

698
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,472
Inside of it in section detailing who Facebook protected from hate speech

699
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,032
There was a multiple choice question that said

700
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Who do we protect

701
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
White men or black children

702
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
In the correct answer was

703
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
White men

704
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Not black

705
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Not even kidding

706
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
White man protecting black

707
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Children are not

708
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
That's not it

709
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
Look it's racist

710
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
Something's going on here

711
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,048
There is absolutely some sort of unaddressed

712
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,864
Bias or systemic issue

713
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
@facebook

714
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Hello

715
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
How are you

716
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
Not long after sitting down with Marsha

717
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
Facebook invited me to come out to their offices

718
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Susan California

719
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
And sit down with that

720
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm going to eat one cookie and then

721
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Typing

722
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,672
Could I just get your your name and your title and

723
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,232
I'm Monika bickert and I lead the policies

724
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,072
Facebook Monika bickert is in charge of all of Facebook's rules

725
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Including their policies on hate speech

726
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
So I asked

727
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,240
They're like why would there be a rule that protects white men

728
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
But not black children

729
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
We have

730
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
We have made our hate

731
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Speech policies

732
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
Let me rephrase that

733
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,296
Are hate speech policies have become more detailed over time

734
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
But

735
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,672
Our main policy is you can attack a person or group of people based on

736
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
A protected characteristic

737
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
A characteristic like race religion or gender

738
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,584
Set this takes a couple beats to explain that the gist of it is that

739
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
The Facebook borrow this idea of protected classes

740
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Straight from us anti.

741
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Discrimination law

742
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,288
These are the laws that make it so that you can't not

743
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Hire someone

744
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,896
Say based on like the religion their ethnicity there

745
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Race

746
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,504
And so on on Facebook you can't attack someone

747
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Based on one of these characteristics

748
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
Meaning you can't say menarche

749
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Nor could you say women are trash

750
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,768
Because eventually you're attacking all men for being men

751
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
So is it the all

752
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
Can I say Bob is trash you can say Bob is

753
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,936
Because at my stores explain to me

754
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
The distinction is that in the first instance you're attacking

755
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
A category

756
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
In the second instance you're attacking a

757
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Person but it's not clear that you're attacking that person be

758
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Cuz

759
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
They are a member of a

760
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Actor category

761
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,344
Oh so Bob might be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being a man he just might be

762
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Right okay so that explains why you take down men are scum but why would you

763
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Leave up

764
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Black children

765
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Hawaii weather

766
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Not

767
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
So traditionally we allowed

768
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Speech

769
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
Once there was some other word in it

770
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
That made it about something other than a protected characteristic

771
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,568
In Facebook jargon these are referred to as

772
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,384
AIA non-protected mod

773
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Sapphire

774
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:09,760
Just beans and literally nothing to give us an example of this

775
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,088
So traditionally if you said I don't like

776
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
This religion

777
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Cab drivers

778
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Cab driver would be the non protect

779
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
Did modifier because

780
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
Employment

781
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Is not a protector

782
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Category

783
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,376
And so what the rules stated was

784
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,264
When you add this non-protected modifier to a protected category

785
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,872
In this case the cabdrivers religion we would allow it because

786
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,992
We can't assume that you're hating is person because of his religion you actually just may not like

787
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Cab driver

788
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,112
So in the case of black children children is modifying the

789
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
Protected category

790
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Black

791
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Pizza children Trump's black

792
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
Age is a non-protected category

793
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Okay so

794
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
Children

795
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Becomes a non-protected modifier

796
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
And they're their there

797
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Childness

798
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Trump's their blackness

799
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
You can say whatever you want about black chilled

800
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,016
Whereas in the case of white men you've got you've got gender and race

801
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Both protected

802
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
You can attack them

803
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
That's just a bizarre rule

804
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
I would think you would go the other direction

805
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,000
That you d protected class would outweigh the modify

806
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
Well they they made this decision

807
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
As they plan to meet because their default was to allow

808
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,520
They were really trying to incorporate or nod to the American free speech

809
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
There's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is it

810
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we say this is

811
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
So bad we're going to take it down

812
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
And that in this case their concern was

813
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
We're all members of like you know at least half a dozen protect

814
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
The categories like we all have gender

815
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
We all have sexual orientation

816
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
If you made the rule is that

817
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Anytime

818
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Protected

819
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Class is mentioned

820
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
It could be hate

821
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:09,056
What you are doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone

822
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
On Facebook to potentially be hates me

823
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Then you're not left with anything

824
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:18,272
Turn right no matter where we draw this line they're going to be stopped some outcomes that we don't like

825
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
They're always going to be casualties

826
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
That's why we continue to change the policy

827
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
And in fact

828
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,720
Since March is debacle they've actually updated this rule

829
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
So now black children are protected from what they considered the worst

830
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Forms

831
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,912
Now car reviewers

832
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,960
Take how severe the attack is

833
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Into consideration

834
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
But despite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network

835
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,456
Marcia who think they're still just isn't good enough

836
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
There are not

837
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Systematic efforts

838
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,416
To eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups

839
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
She thinks

840
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
White men in heterosexual should not be protected

841
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Protect the group

842
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
Who are actually victims of hate

843
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Makes sense

844
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
Oh yeah because in sort of hate speech

845
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
We're thinking about hate speech

846
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,080
There's this idea of privilege door of historically disadvantaged groups

847
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,384
And that those historically disadvantaged

848
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Groups should have more protection

849
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Because of

850
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Being historically disadvantaged

851
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
And the challenge with that that was presented to me was

852
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
Okay

853
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
In the 1940s

854
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
Cut off the Chinese

855
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
Caffe in change if you had

856
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
Japanese soldiers

857
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Chinese

858
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
Showing millions of China

859
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
During World War II

860
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,408
At that same time you had Japanese-American Citizens

861
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Would have to move

862
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,760
Being put into internment

863
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
And so we have to ask ourselves a question like

864
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
Are the Japanese and historically

865
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Advantage or disadvantage group

866
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,720
Japanese Americans

867
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged

868
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,096
But in China it is a totally different story

869
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
In this happened at the exact same moment

870
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
You got two different places to differ

871
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Cultural

872
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
When you have a website like

873
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
My Facebook

874
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
Transnational community

875
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,176
They realize that they decided that ideas of privilege

876
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
Are so geographically bound

877
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,808
That there is no way

878
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,696
To evade actively weigh and consider who is privileged above who

879
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
And decided therefore

880
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,096
That we are not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege

881
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
I into the equation

882
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
And I think it's very important to keep in mind here

883
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
The moderators only have like four five seconds to make a decision

884
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
In those four seconds is there enough time to

885
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
Did to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given IP addresses can easily be mask

886
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
Is it enough time to figure out a person's ethnicity

887
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:20,799
On top of that we often don't know an individual's race

888
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,127
Other categories are even less clear like sexual orientation

889
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
And they've they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively

890
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
When we were

891
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Building.

892
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
Framework we did a lot of cats

893
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
And we saw some

894
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
Sometimes that it was just too hard for reviewers

895
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
To implement

896
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
A more detailed

897
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
A policy

898
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Consistently

899
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
They just couldn't do it

900
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Accurately

901
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
So

902
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:51,519
We want the policies to be sufficiently detailed to take into account all different types of scenarios

903
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
But simple enough

904
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
That we can apply them consistently

905
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
Can accurately around the world

906
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,575
And the reality is anytime that the policies become more complicated we see dips in our consistency

907
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
What Facebook's trying to do is take

908
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
The First Amendment this

909
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
High-minded lofty legal concept

910
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,095
In converted into an engineering manual

911
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
That can be executed every 4 seconds

912
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
It's for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe

913
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
And when you got to move that fast

914
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
Sometimes Justice

915
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Lose it

916
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,431
That's the that's the tension here

917
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
And

918
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
I just want to

919
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,623
Make sure I emphasize that

920
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
These policies

921
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
They're not going to please everybody they often don't don't

922
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
Please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook

923
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,071
If we want to have one line

924
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
The reinforced

925
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Consistently

926
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
Bennett means

927
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,215
We have to have some pretty objective

928
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
Black and white rule

929
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Coca-Cola

930
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Very funny

931
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
But

932
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
When we come back

933
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Those rules

934
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
Bacon tapas

935
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
This is Danny from Denver Colorado

00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,295
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

937
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,879

938
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

939
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:53,119
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

940
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
And I'm here because I need your

941
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
And I request

942
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,639
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

943
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

944
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
Brilliance

945
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Basically I want to hear about this

946
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,343
Times when a kid you know did something

947
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,647
It just means you lean back and say

948
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Well

949
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
How did they do that

950
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:22,559
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

951
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
To you

952
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

953
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,983
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

954
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
Or maybe the kids in math class you notice their writing used

955
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Taking the margin of their geometry

956
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,735
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

957
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
It doesn't have anything to do with it

958
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
If you have a story

959
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
T-shirt

960
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
Go to radiolab.org

961
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Brilliance

962
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
Record a short audio mess

963
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

964
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Thank you so much

965
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
Jad Robert Radiolab

966
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Back to Simon Outlet

967
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
Facebook free speech

968
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
So as we just heard before the break

969
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,087
Facebook is trying to do two competing things at

970
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
They're trying to make rules that are just

971
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
But at the same time can be reliably X

972
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Executed by thousands

973
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,303
People spread across the globe in ways that are fair

974
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Consistent

975
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,887
I would argue that this balancing a

976
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
It was put to the test

977
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
April 15th

978
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
2013

979
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
Bruce Wright

980
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
We have some breaking news

981
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
Otherwise I wouldn't cut you off

982
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,015
Monday the 15th 2013 just before 3 in the afternoon

983
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
Two pressure-cooker bombs

984
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,167
Through the crowd near the Finish Line Boston

985
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,263
And

986
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,079
The answer to the dust begin to settle

987
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
Oh my God

988
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
People are springing into action

989
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,111
Add this one man in a cowboy hat season spectator who's been injured

990
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Pick some up

991
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Rose in a wheelchair

992
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,999
Announce they're pushing him through they're the sort of ashy cloud

993
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,327
There's a photographer there any snaps this phone

994
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,727
In the photo show is the runner in the cowboy hat

995
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
And these two other people pushing this man

996
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Who I

997
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,639
His face is Ashen from all of the debris

998
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
Is hair is there two standing on end and you can tell that actually the force of the blast and then the the particles that got

999
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,599
Tanner actually holding it in this sort of wedge shape

1000
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
And

1001
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
One of his legs is completely blown off

1002
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
And the second one is blown off

1003
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:05,887
Below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons

1004
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
It's it horrified

1005
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Meanwhile

1006
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,799
CVS Bay Area Studio on the other side of the country

1007
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
I remember Snippets of the day

1008
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
Facebook employees for clustering around several days

1009
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,503
Staring at the computer screen

1010
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Watching the news break

1011
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,391
Kern just in the last half-hour or so I have memories of

1012
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:31,743
Watching some of the coverage has just released

1013
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,607
Of the Boston bombing remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that

1014
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
I posted on Facebook

1015
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
From the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but

1016
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Pretty quickly

1017
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
Photos going viral

1018
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
And we realized

1019
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
We're going to have to deal with it

1020
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
This image is spreading like wildfire

1021
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
It appears to be way out

1022
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,671
Side the rules they'd written by its in this

1023
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
Totally new country

1024
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
So together team together

1025
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
Sat down in the conference

1026
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,375
I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like

1027
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
Should we allow it or should they take it down

1028
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
According to the rules

1029
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah so if you recall the no insides on the outsides definition that we hadn't placed

1030
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Meeting

1031
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
You can't see like

1032
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,199
People's organs or that sort of thing

1033
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
And if you can then we wouldn't allow it

1034
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
And in this

1035
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
In this photo you can see

1036
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
You can definitely

1037
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
And so by the rules the photo should obviously

1038
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Come down yep

1039
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
However

1040
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
Have to run says

1041
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
No

1042
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
The other people are saying

1043
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
This is news

1044
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:45,215
Essentially this phone is being posted everywhere else it's important

1045
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
We need to suspend the rules

1046
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
We need to make an exception

1047
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,383
Which immediately receive push back while I was saying that

1048
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,455
What we've prided ourselves on was not making those calls

1049
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
And there are no exception

1050
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
There's either

1051
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Are there mistakes

1052
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
Orange Roofing

1053
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
We made the guideline for moments like this

1054
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,719
Twitch the other side shoot back oh my God are you kidding me like

1055
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,047
The Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you

1056
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,631
F****** kidding me damn the guidelines must have common sense your lips

1057
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,167
The humans we know that this isn't

1058
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
End

1059
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Yeah there

1060
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Kind of

1061
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
The right

1062
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
But

1063
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
The reality is like

1064
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
If you say

1065
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,871
Well we allowed it because it's newsworthy

1066
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
How

1067
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
How do you answer

1068
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
Any of the questions about any of the rest of the

1069
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,111
In other words this is a Pandora's

1070
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,999
And in fact for reasons that are totally clear team consistency team follow the rules

1071
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
Eventually wins the day

1072
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
They decide to take the photo down

1073
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
But before they can pull the lever

1074
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
Word starts making its way up to

1075
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
And internally within Facebook

1076
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,055
According to my sources in executive under Zuckerberg sent down in order

1077
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
We were essentially

1078
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
I told

1079
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Make the exception

1080
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,807
I don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is

1081
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
The photos

1082
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,623
You're not taking this down

1083
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Yes

1084
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
That's what happened

1085
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,559
This decision means

1086
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,119
If Facebook has just become a publisher

1087
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Whitley.

1088
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
I think maybe they have

1089
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,727
Bucket Maiden news judgment

1090
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:28,639
And just really knowing they've become CBS ABC near time and Atlantic

1091
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
A news organization yeah

1092
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,039
I in this brings up a legal question that that's at the center

1093
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,599
Of of this conversation about free speech

1094
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
Like

1095
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
Is Facebook a sort of collective

1096
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
Scrapbook for a cell or is it a public

1097
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,535
Square where you should be able to say whatever you want

1098
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Or

1099
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
Yeah it is it now in uzor

1100
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Currency election

1101
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
I'm sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final

1102
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,239
How to release what year

1103
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
You talk too much

1104
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
What exactly

1105
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Facebook is

1106
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,383
And this question has been popping up a lot reason

1107
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,175
In fact it even came up

1108
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
This past April

1109
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,503
When Zuckerberg was testifying in front

1110
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
Congress

1111
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
I think about a hundred

1112
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
40 million

1113
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
Americans get their news from

1114
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
Facebook

1115
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
So

1116
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Which are you

1117
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Are you are you at

1118
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
Company are you the world

1119
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
World's largest

1120
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Thunder this is

1121
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
The primary thing that

1122
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
We do is build

1123
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
Technology and products

1124
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Well

1125
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
I agree that we were

1126
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Responsible for the count

1127
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Compatible with

1128
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Fundamentally yet

1129
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
At our core

1130
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
Bia technology

1131
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
Company were the main thing that we do is having

1132
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Engineers and Bill product

1133
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,647
Basically Zuckerberg and others at the company are arguing no

1134
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
There not a new Darkness

1135
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
Why what would be the downside of that

1136
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Will Facebook currently

1137
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:53,119
Sits on this little idyllic illegal Island where

1138
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,191
They can't be held liable for much of anything there

1139
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
Subjected to few regulations

1140
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,335
However were they to be seen in the eyes of the court and the media organization

1141
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
That could change

1142
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,223
But setting that aside what really strikes me about all of this

1143
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,295
Is it here you have a company that really

1144
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,647
Up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules

1145
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
That are both

1146
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
As objective as possible

1147
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,791
And can be executed as consistently

1148
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
And they've been willing to sacrifice

1149
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,447
Rather large ideas in in the name of this thing

1150
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Forgettable privilege

1151
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Which we talk

1152
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,591
What about that they decided was to geographically bound to allow for 1

1153
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
But if

1154
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,455
If you ask me that there's nothing more

1155
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,527
Subjective or geographically bound

1156
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,879
Then what people find interesting or important what what people

1157
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,159
Find newsworthy

1158
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,743
Don't get it and I'll give you I'll give you a great example of this

1159
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,815
They haven't just six months after the Boston area

1160
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,863
Embalming when this video starts

1161
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
Out of northern Mexico

1162
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,983
And it's a video of a

1163
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,519
A woman being

1164
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Grab

1165
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,847
And forced onto her knees in front of a camera

1166
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
And then a man

1167
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
With his face covered

1168
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
Grabs her head pulled her head back in

1169
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Slices

1170
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Her head off right in front of the

1171
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
And this video starts being spread

1172
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,695
I can't count how many times I just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like

1173
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
One person came across this video or at least

1174
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,559
Dozens of others like it was Shannon Young

1175
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:30,143
My name is Shannon Young I am a freelance radio reporter

1176
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
Been living here in Mexico for for many years now and then is covering the drug war in doing so years back she know

1177
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Noticed this strange phenomena

1178
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:44,479
It first caught my attention in early 2010 Dragon social media you know your scroll

1179
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:49,599
Run through your feet and he know you'd see all this news people say there was a three-hour gunbattle and

1180
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:54,463
Intense fighting all weekend long for posting about clashes between drug cartels

1181
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
Government forces

1182
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,327
But then when Shannon would watch the news that night

1183
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,727
Sheep the reports on the economy and

1184
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,799
Soccer results but the media wasn't covering it

1185
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
There be no mention of these attacks

1186
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Nothing to do with the violence

1187
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
And so she another journalist

1188
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Try to get the bottom of

1189
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:22,623
Reporters in Mexico City with contact State authorities and they know public information officer and they be like shootings bombing

1190
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
What are you talking about

1191
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
Nothing's going on we have no reports of anything

1192
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
These are just internet rumors

1193
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
The government even coined a term for these sorts of posts

1194
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,887
The famous phrase of the time was Collective psychosis

1195
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:38,495
These people are crazy because you know they didn't want the situation to seem out of control

1196
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,055
But then a video is

1197
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
It opens

1198
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,783
Looking out the windshield of a car on a sunny day

1199
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
The landscape is dry Dusty

1200
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,671
Videos of a shaky clearly shot on a phone

1201
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:03,327
And then the woman taping star

1202
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
Cards talk

1203
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,423
This woman she just narrates

1204
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
As they drive along this

1205
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Highway

1206
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,639
Sheet pans the phone from the passenger window to the to the Wynn

1207
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Windshield

1208
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:22,015
Focusing in on these two silver destroyed pickup trucks

1209
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
And she said look at these cars over here are there if you know shut up and eat

1210
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,791
Mercure unibus 18-wheeler as you know totally abandon it got shot up

1211
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,095
1 Point sheet

1212
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,703
Stick the phone out the window to show all of the bullet casings

1213
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
Littering the ground

1214
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,567
And she just turn the the official Denial on it

1215
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Ted

1216
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,663
The government was saying there's no violence

1217
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
Here were cars riddled with bullets

1218
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
It was impossible to dismiss

1219
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
And from then on

1220
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,159
You had more and more citizens

1221
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,999
Citizen journalists uploading anonymously

1222
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,327
Video of the violence

1223
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,447
He's Lo-Fi shaky shots of

1224
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,519
Shootout dismemberment

1225
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
Beheadings I mean

1226
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
Bodies hanging

1227
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
Dangling off of overpasses

1228
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,903
Proved the world that this is really happening

1229
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,303
We're not crazy

1230
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
It's a cry for help

1231
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Yeah

1232
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
Which brings us back to that beheading V

1233
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
Yeah that video of the beheading

1234
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
A lot of people are uploading it condemning the violence

1235
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
The drug cartel

1236
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
And when it started showing up on Facebook

1237
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,551
Much like with the Boston Marathon bombing photo

1238
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,671
This team of people they sat down in a room looked at the policy of weight the arguments

1239
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,951
And my argument was

1240
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
It was okay by the rules during the Boston bombing

1241
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
Why isn't it okay now

1242
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
Particularly

1243
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,935
Given that it could help leaving this up means we warned hundreds of thousands of people at the brutality of these cartels

1244
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
And so

1245
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
We kept it up

1246
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
However

1247
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
It's f****** Raw

1248
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
It's why I think it's

1249
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,711
Oxalate responsible and impact quiet despicable of them

1250
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
People found out

1251
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
I have little neighbor kid

1252
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,575
It like that

1253
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,367
Backlash

1254
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Application for Lawrence

1255
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
Videos to people as powerful as David

1256
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Cameron Wake

1257
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Today's appointment is done

1258
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,607
Stony criticized the move thing we have to protect children from this

1259
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
David Cameron tweeted

1260
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,959
It's irresponsible of Facebook to post

1261
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
Beheading videos

1262
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
People were really upset because of what it was

1263
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,103
And so according to my sources

1264
00:58:55,615 --> 00:59:01,247
Some of the folks involved in making this decision to leave it up or once again taken into an executive's office

1265
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
And so we went up

1266
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
And and there was a lot of

1267
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
Internal pressure to remove it

1268
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
And I go to my boss and say Hey look

1269
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
This is the decision we made

1270
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
I recognize this

1271
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,303
This is controversial I want to let you know why we made these decisions

1272
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
And they made their case

1273
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:20,447
There are valid and important human rights reasons why you would want this to be out there to show the kind of

1274
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Savage

1275
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,263
And she vehement Lee

1276
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:29,919
They took another approach arguing that if we take this down you're deciding to punish people who are trying to raise awareness

1277
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
Again

1278
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
She wasn't budging and just didn't get

1279
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
Didn't get passed

1280
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
And

1281
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
Ultimately

1282
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
I was overruled

1283
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
And we removed it

1284
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:48,351
Just because there was pressure to do so the same people that six months prior told them to leave it up because of his music

1285
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,655
Said take the video down

1286
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,239
Reverse a decision in band a video post

1287
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
Go to the site of a woman thing

1288
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
The headed

1289
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Facebook

1290
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
A quote when

1291
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,711
If you want the one from Boston and you probably should have the one for Mexico and right

1292
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,991
It was a mistake

1293
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Yeah

1294
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
I think it was a mistake

1295
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
Because I

1296
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
I felt like

1297
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,975
Like why do we have these rules in place in the first

1298
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
And

1299
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
And

1300
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
And it's not the

1301
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
The only reason

1302
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
But decisions like that

1303
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Are the thing that precipitated melee

1304
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Leaving

1305
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Yep

1306
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,639
Not too long after that incident a few members of the team decided to quit

1307
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,479
And what would I think this story shows

1308
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Is that

1309
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295
Facebook has become

1310
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,831
Too many different things at the same

1311
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,647
The Facebook is now

1312
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
Turtle playground

1313
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,255
It's also an R-rated movie theater

1314
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,815
And now it's the front page of a newspaper

1315
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:56,191
My mother thinks the same time it's all distinct at the same time and in what we

1316
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,495
The users are demanding of them

1317
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,799
Is that they create a set of policies that are

1318
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
Just

1319
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,431
And the reality is just as means a very different thing in each one of these setting

1320
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,759
Justice would mean that the person in Mexico gets told the truth

1321
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
In Mexico by Facebook

1322
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:16,159
A little boy in England doesn't have to look at something gory and horrible in England

1323
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
But you can't put them together

1324
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Because they Clash

1325
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Exactly

1326
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,559
So how do you solve that

1327
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
The I don't know

1328
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,935
I think it's important to keep in mind

1329
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,287
That even if you have the perfect set of policies that

1330
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,615
That somehow managed to be just in different settings and that

1331
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,151
To be consistently enforced

1332
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,967
The people at the end of the day making these

1333
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Decision

1334
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,599
They're still there still

1335
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
Still human beings

1336
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,439
Is the office working or no

1337
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
I can hear you

1338
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,511
Yeah great okay

1339
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,815
At long last we figured it out huh

1340
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
Yeah clearly

1341
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,167
I spoke to one woman who did this work for face

1342
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Buckeyes want to be

1343
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Anonymous I don't want

1344
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
Dump even know that I'm doing it because

1345
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
They might file charges against

1346
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
Will call her Marie

1347
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
She's from the Philippines where

1348
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
She grew up on a coffee Farm

1349
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
That's my father's

1350
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Stop grow

1351
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,879
And I didn't know that coffee was only for adults

1352
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,719
She said many afternoons while she was growing up

1353
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
She and her mother would sit together

1354
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Side

1355
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,583
Sipping their coffee and

1356
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
Tuning into the shortwave

1357
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Washington DC

1358
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
And they sit there

1359
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
Listening to The Voice of America

1360
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Silent

1361
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
I'm going to ask that we all

1362
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
Bobbleheads

1363
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,503
She said one of her favorite things to catch on Voice of America where Billy Graham's

1364
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,831
Billy Graham one of the great evangelist

1365
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
Our Father we thank thee for this

1366
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Love of God

1367
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
That reaches around the world

1368
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Xiamen golf

1369
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,911
But then

1370
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:10,335
Fast forward 50 years to 2010 and Marie is consuming a very different sort of American Media

1371
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,895
The videos were the ones that affected me

1372
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
There were times when I felt

1373
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,551
Really bad that I am a Christian and then I look into these things

1374
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,951
She became a Content moderator back in 2010 and was actually one of the first people in the Philippines doing this work

1375
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
Usually had the night shift

1376
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:35,679
In the early morning or in the dawn from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.

1377
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:42,079
She work from home and despite it being dark she put blankets up over the windows so no one could see in at what she was look

1378
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,127
Cheap lock the door to keep

1379
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
Superkids out

1380
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,943
Are you have to go drive them away

1381
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
Alright without them. It's Otto

1382
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Making of Watch

1383
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,879
And she and the other moderators on her team who lived throughout the Philippine

1384
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
They were trained on the guideline

1385
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
On this robot

1386
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,535
There were policies if you have to adhere to

1387
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,327
Some of us were

1388
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Redis

1389
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,935
Gleeking passpasspass even if it's not really fast

1390
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Spanish

1391
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
Just to get through the content fast

1392
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
And in some cases she thinks

1393
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,103
Number of the moderators

1394
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
My doing it

1395
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
As a form of retaliation for the low rate

1396
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
People were pissed at the low pay

1397
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,575
If I can ask how much what how much were you making an hour doing

1398
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
As far as I remember it

1399
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
We were babies

1400
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,231
Like $2.50

1401
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
Where our

1402
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,607
Marie wouldn't say whether or not this low-wage led her to just

1403
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Let things through

1404
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,679
But she did say

1405
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Based on my

1406
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,287
Ghost background

1407
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,615
That I can look objectively at

1408
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,223
So I reject many of the things that I

1409
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,759
Think are not

1410
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Acceptable

1411
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Really

1412
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Of course

1413
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,671
She said whether something with outside the rules or not

1414
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,463
If forgot told her to

1415
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,255
She just took it down

1416
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
Whenever it affects me a lot

1417
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,095
I would click the button.

1418
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
It's a violation

1419
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,471
Because if it's going to disturb the young or

1420
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
And he should not be there

1421
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
So

1422
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,359
If there's a nude person

1423
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,967
Whether it was a breastfeeding photo or an anatomy video or a piece of art

1424
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,783
I would consider it that's pornography

1425
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
And then

1426
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Right away

1427
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
It's a violation

1428
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,999
You took the law into your own hands you went vigilante

1429
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
Say something

1430
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
So yeah I have to

1431
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
Protect kids

1432
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
From

1433
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
Evil

Site of humankind

1435
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:38,463
Where does that leave you feeling good leave you feeling at this is just at the end this is

1436
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
System

1437
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
Undoable

1438
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
II

1439
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,143
I think they will inevitably fail

1440
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
But they have to try

1441
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
And I think we should all be rooting for them

1442
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:27,359
