1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Let me tell you there is nothing like the she relation of Discovery I think you know that this is the end of malaria this is the end of everything else

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Mosquitoes spread wait a minute you know ticks spread Lyme disease we can probably get rid of that too I thought in the morning

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
Singing to the turtles in the in the parking

7
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,656
Pretty much and I got myself a full day of being who

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
And then I

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
But but

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
But

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
What if something goes

12
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
Wrong

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
I'm Jenna boom Radiolab and the guy they just heard is Kevin esvelt he's a scientist

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
You talkin to a producers

15
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
Soren wheeler and Molly Webster about

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,976
Crispr when she's at a technology cheese and you it's a gene editing technology

17
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Tok can we shape

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Life

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah we ended up doing an entire show about

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
And we called it a antibodies part 1 river that there was going to be a part 2

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
That's weird name that it's like telling someone you got them a birthday present but you haven't yet

22
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
We should just own up

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
Radiolab listeners we did not

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
Liplicious listen

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,648
Texting me know we ment to we meant to have a part 2

26
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
But you know we're doing a story

27
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
It fell apart his workout

28
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
Sucked frankly and we thought I was going to Astoria

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,168
Turn turn out to be stored at now we have what we're going to do is we're going to

30
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Pay you what your Jill the part 2

31
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
Yeah this is the part 2 finally

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Part 2 because

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
Crispr in the time that we did the thing till now

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,248
Has gone banana crazy everyday in the science

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Action which I know we all read religious

36
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,160
Be there is a crisper thing I started we're going to play you the original piece

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
For those of you who never heard it

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Justice reset the Baseline and then we're going to come back and tell you all this stuff

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
It happened since you

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
There is only explain DIY got

41
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Got started with this

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,776
You were some kind of an affair to tell you how I was at a party

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
It was a it was a

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Conference where they have a lot of different people with different disciplines come together

45
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
You know one of those

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Are panelists

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
Since we're at one of those functions

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
And

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
It was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,256
A lot of booze being serious everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach

51
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
So I was standing there with some violin

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
What are the fun ones

53
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
The jump Palace

54
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,008
Night my people fairly and they they start to lose

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Their s***

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Like genuinely lose their s***

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
About this thing called

58
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
And like I've never seen signs

59
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Excited about anything

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
What is crispr

61
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,832
Trying to explain to me what they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
I gather that had something to do with genetics and then at one point one of the biologist tournament is like

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
I'll tell you what it is

64
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
I can use crispr to take a little dog

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
And poof make it to a big dog

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Give me a chihuahua

67
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
Turn it into the size of a Great Dane and was like no you

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
He's like yes I can I could do it with crispr

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
What the hell is this thing

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
To sit here is you

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
I will get

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,064
So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl Zimmer

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Because I just figured

74
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
For this kind of thing

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
The car thing I got tok

76
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,512
Dr. Carl so I like why all the fuss

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
Maybe it was just the alcohol or but maybe there's something really

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Happening Here

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
Oh there's something totally happening there I mean it's

80
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
He started

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
So that

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
You you can actually find like

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
The first reference

84
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
In a 1987 paper

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
And some Japanese scientist

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
They basically describe something weird

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
N e coli and they said we don't know what this is

88
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
Coli are bacteria inside humans and like all living things

89
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,536
Equalize made up of DNA and T's and C's Angie's and what happened was it the scientist

90
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
Reading a chunk of that genetic code

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
When

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
They found this really strange

93
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Stretch of DNA

94
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,055
Stretch out well so basically what it was

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
5 identical sequences

96
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
In a row

97
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
And then they were separated by very short

98
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
Sequences in between them that were

99
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
All different from each other

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
The little blurb

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
To be like

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
And they look at that sound like what

103
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
But this is nothing like we've seen before repeated sequences in bacterial genomes are kind of unusual

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
Seems very strange some biologists felt that there must be a purpose

105
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,247
Among those purple sneakers Jennifer doudna University of California Berkeley cell biology

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,343
If I used to be called the dude

107
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,207
Sometimes it's cool in the movie she will be played by Jeff

108
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Right meow

109
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
Xango's on scientist are single repeat Loop repeats

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Everywhere

111
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah release in bacteria lots and lots of lots species of bacteria

112
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,335
They say okay wait a minute it's kind of cool your findings it's so often

113
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
Is this where the name Christopher comes from

114
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
The full official name is

115
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Clustered

116
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Regularly interspaced

117
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Short palindromic

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Repeat

119
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
My gospel

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
I don't know why they called it

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Furniture

122
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Sound like an app

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
But now

124
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Scientist had the puzzle

125
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
If nature at this level preserve something

126
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Intact

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Here and here

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
And here and here and here and here

129
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
And some of these here

130
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Creatures that have been around

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Hundreds of millions of years

132
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
You figure out

133
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
Whatever this is

134
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Doing something

135
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
But what

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
It doesn't take very long

137
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
Before the first big clue comes up

138
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Fast forward

139
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
2005 now scientists have these big

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Searchable database

141
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Does DNA sequencing system scientists

142
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Bank Willis do a search

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
Let's see if these repeating patterns Wiki

144
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Finding match anything else

145
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
It's out there in the world

146
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
And

147
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
The scientist guitar

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
Using computers to just line up these stretches of DNA with thousands upon thousands of different species and then

149
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Click

150
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Discover

151
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Did those bits of DNA

152
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Tween the repeats

153
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Stuck in the Middle does blurt

154
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
These

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Are matching virus DNA

156
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Like you can find viruses

157
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
With

158
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Jeanswear

159
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,519
The little you know these little to the bacteria had virus inside of them

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
Is that what that mean that that a virus brought it

161
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Into this

162
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
The first recognition was

163
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
This is virus DNA

164
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Somehow all these bacteria

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
A little snippet the virus DNA

166
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
West Indies

167
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Particular places

168
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Energy now

169
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
Which is a little weird if you think about that means are totally different creatures

170
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
It would be like inside a human finding a little bit of mosquito.

171
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
How do we interpret this well

172
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
Actually there was one scientist named Eugene koonin

173
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
To look at these results and just had

174
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Okay I guess

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
It's a defense

176
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:48,479
Why would you think that cuz he's a brilliant man if I went to a large

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Sanitation dump

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,647
And I found a teeny bit of human hair why would I think

179
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
I wouldn't know it just like a bit human

180
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Well you see

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
That metaphor might

182
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Sort of betray your lack

183
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,215
Skill in microbiology like this is not a dump alright this is

184
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Bacteria are not going to just

185
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Let virus DNA

186
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Get into their jeans willy-nilly

187
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Okay remember

188
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Viruses are the big anime

189
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
If your bacteria

190
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Viruses make your life a nightmare

191
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
Think about in the ocean okay the

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
The ocean is

193
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
Full of viruses and

194
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
And

195
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Viruses kill up to 40%

196
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Of all of those bacteria

197
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Everyday

198
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Everyday

199
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
And

200
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
We know that they have defenses

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
When Eugene koonin said was

202
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Okay

203
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
I'm going to bet that

204
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
These bacteria

205
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Are somehow

206
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Grabbing pieces of DNA

207
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
From viruses

208
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
And then they're storing it

209
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
And now they have a way of recognize

210
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Does viruses have

211
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
They come in later

212
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
Take little Polaroid shots of the enemy

213
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
Write know thy enemy

214
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Poster

215
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
What do you called the mugshot

216
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
This is Eugene koonin

217
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,471
Evolutionary genomics group at the national Center for biotechnology information

218
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
He's the guy that called reference to stunk up the whole idea that maybe these bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria

219
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Is the bacteria trying to defend itself

220
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Both but really if I if I

221
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
If I if I could eat myself

222
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Anythink

223
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
It was not so much kissing

224
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Because you know

225
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Let's get freaky

226
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
18

227
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Figuring

228
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Ouch

229
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
How the mechanism of likely to be

230
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
So can you

231
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Walk us through

232
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
How the mechanism is likely to work

233
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
All right

234
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
What happens if

235
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
You know when the fires comes in

236
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
2

237
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Excel

238
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
I just kind of

239
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
Explodes in Skyrim Lisa's naked jeans basically

240
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,415
If you're this bacteria these things might take over your cell so you've got to respond

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
UShip multiple

242
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Weapons of Defense

243
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
If you've never seen this virus

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
Before using the first thing you do says Eugene is you send out these enzymes

245
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,191
Pack the viruses they're sort of like the ground troops

246
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Any fights really hard

247
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
But much of the time

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,735
Vape fail and then nobody else you are here about

249
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
You're not terribly stupid

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
It's good fighter so very often

251
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Virus takes over

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Bacteria.

253
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
But but there is some

254
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Nonzero probability

255
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
Did you actually survive at

256
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
If you do

257
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
Then with the bacterial do with sending some new enzymes to basically cleanup

258
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
Go out find any stray viruses.

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
The enemy DNA into

260
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Beautiful smokey

261
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
And here he says it's where you get to

262
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
To the storage

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,159
Does enzymes woman take those little bits of virus and shove them into the bacteria's

264
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
Own DNA right in those little spaces

265
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Between the repeat

266
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Right there

267
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
So I use those

268
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Spaces in my own

269
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
DNA as a storage facility

270
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
Yes if you'll be able to exist

271
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
You use a different memory device

272
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Cuz here's what happened

273
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
Next time that virus shows up

274
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Express jeans everywhere now

275
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
You are

276
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Pair

277
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,063
This is where the Christmas tree really gets going

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
Cuz instead of sending out the ground troops were probably going to get their asses

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Now you can actually send out the

280
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Guns

281
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
What the cell does it will manufacture these special

282
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Molecular assassin

283
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
And we'll give those assassin a copy

284
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Of that little bit of virus DNA it hasn't storage spaces thing here take this mugshot if you see anything that matches this

285
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Pattern killer

286
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
And these attackers do we know what they look but one of them looks like

287
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Yep so we know what the protein looks like it it it actually looks I would describe it a little bit like a clam

288
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
Sort of Imagine Pac-Man become misshapen dandruff

289
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Which one of these guys

290
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
What it has is

291
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
A copy of that virus DNA

292
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
It's got the mugshot that is kind of waving around

293
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
What then happens is that whenever the Pac-Man bumps into some virus DNA

294
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
It pulls apart

295
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
The DNA

296
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Is Ipsy

297
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Read it

298
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
It's not the right one goes on

299
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,375
And if that RNA has the same sequence

300
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
Then click it just locks in

301
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
And molecular blades

302
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Come out and shop

303
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,599
So this is smart scissors to it's like

304
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
You're like the thing I got

305
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
All right now we're going to kill

306
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Stack match

307
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
When scientist first discovered this whole system

308
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
They're fascinated

309
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
They were like

310
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Still working it out

311
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
They're like

312
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
How can this happen

313
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Cool

314
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
But then

315
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
In walks the dude

316
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
Jennifer doudna

317
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
With a crazy idea what are the crazy radical

318
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
This could be amazing

319
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
Technology

320
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,719
This is a tool right this is a tool that we can use to cut DNA

321
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Where we want to cut DNA

322
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
Her basic thought was when we turn this defense

323
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Into office

324
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
These things they seem to be really good at cutting

325
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
I need the only thing to cut the things that are on their mug

326
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Pazzo

327
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
Maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshots instead of them going after viruses

328
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Maybe they could go after a gene that causes

329
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Huntington's disease are haemophilia

330
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
For example

331
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
So you got a mouse with something like

332
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Haemophilia

333
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
This is a diseases caused by one bad G

334
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
So what you do is you take diesel surgeon to give them the mugshot for the bad Gene then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot in a mouse

335
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Can you set it loose

336
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
And just like this program to

337
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
It will find that Gene and

338
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Shop

339
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
The scissors will end up

340
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Cutting exactly

341
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Virginia wanted

342
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
The badge is gone

343
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
Now the question is how do you put in the good G

344
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Nitrite turns out actually going to jennifer doudna

345
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Actually not as hard as you would think

346
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
Really yeah apparently what you do is

347
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
It's just that

348
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
Throw this new good Jean

349
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Kind of in the neighborhood where the girl genius

350
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Just in the general vicinity

351
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
You don't have to get super-precise and it turns out that

352
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,823
You know there are repair enzymes that are probably continually

353
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Surveying and checking

354
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
For brakes

355
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
This is what happens inside the cell

356
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Is repair Crews

357
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Come along the sea the break

358
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
The CD good Jean just sitting there next to the break to be like all right

359
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
I'll just take it in with the pretty guy in this space he said we take advantage of a natural repair

360
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Are pathway that cells have

361
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
They trick both the Cutters and the fish

362
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Yeah now we're not assassinating anymore

363
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Now we're actually

364
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Engineering

365
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
Agon from killing to refashioning

366
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,647
Designing jeans doing genetic

367
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Form of genetic engineer

368
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
30 years yes but

369
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Not like

370
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,263
Genome editing technology they've been around for a long time but none of them have been as powerful as

371
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Crispr

372
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Best Bets

373
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz she was actually one of the biologists

374
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,527
Should I drunkenly talk to at that thing Modern Art Museum I can't even really remember

375
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,135
Evening setting be so vague

376
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Back in the day

377
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
This is just like two years ago

378
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,607
You have these Gina De things you would take one put in a cell and what happened before was

379
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
You would give it some instructions about where to go

380
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
And it might go there but it might go somewhere that's a kind of related to where that was

381
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Staten Island

382
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Ridiculous

383
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,783
Not only would it take left Staten Island did not find there but it would cost you a fortune and taking up 6 months of your time to get

384
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
You know it's really easy

385
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
You just give it that mugshot

386
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
And it goes I'm going to find that guy

387
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
Exactly so it seems to be pretty precise

388
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
And it's

389
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,375
Cheap like the old tools would set you back about five grand to use them once crispr

390
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
The 75 bucks

391
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
And here's the kicker says Carl it seems

392
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
At the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria

393
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
Stickman to almost any other creature

394
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
It still works

395
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
You can use this

396
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Same crispr system

397
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Can you like do it

398
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Hornets

399
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
Vulnerable

400
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
You can do in corn corn do it in anything

401
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
I have not I'm waiting for someone to say

402
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Crispr doesn't work in

403
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Species X

404
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
And I have not heard of that

405
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
So basically what you have for the first time in science

406
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
Is Gene editing technology that is

407
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Is cheap

408
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Precise

409
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Possible universe

410
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
And Jennifer doudna says the moment the

411
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
The full impact of

412
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Landed on Earth

413
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,663
I really I literally had you know the hairs on the back of my neck rest

414
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,855
Just processing the fact that this thing exists

415
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
You know that you could actually

416
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Program it

417
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
To cut DNA and

418
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Just like this

419
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Molecular scissors and I can just

420
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Program and it cuts DNA wherever I want

421
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
It is amazing

422
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Unless

423
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Think about it

424
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Further

425
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Which we will do engine

426
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
I feel a cloud

427
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Coming over there

428
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,831
Don't you see I see you

429
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Over there but will be right

430
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
Hi this is Lauren from Atlanta Georgia

431
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Radiolab

432
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,327
Supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of

433
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
Science and technology in the modern world

434
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,239
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

435
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,103
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

436
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
And I'm here because I need your help

437
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
And I request

438
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

439
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
About what we're calling tiny moments

440
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Brilliance

441
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,327
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

442
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

443
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Maybe it was the moment that I

444
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,543
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

445
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
To you

446
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

447
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,967
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

448
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,831
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

449
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,487
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

450
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Have anything to do with the test

451
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
If you have a story

452
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
T-shirt with us

453
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
Go to radiolab.org

454
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Brilliance

455
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Record a short audio message for us

456
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,031
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

457
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
Thank you so much

458
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,487
Is Radiolab Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich okay so clearly the

459
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Possibilities are there to use crispr to treat disease

460
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Right

461
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
What if you could

462
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Get a little more fanciful

463
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,239
Write like what if you can actually go back in time and resurrect long-lost

464
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,359
Mrs. Talk about a lot we Could reconstruct using a computer

465
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,199
What did genome sequence of the ancestor of all birds was

466
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
And that would have been

467
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Kind of dinosaur

468
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
Anime could use crispr to turn the chicken into that thing

469
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
For what if you could take an elephant

470
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
And

471
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Snip snip snip

472
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Gradually turning

473
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Into its long-lost relative

474
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
The woolly mammoth

475
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Cuz they're related

476
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
But if they're there

477
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
We're right but if you know the woolly mammoth genome which they do cuz

478
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Play Family Guy.

479
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Crossbones

480
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Then you could

481
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,127
Compare the number of differences use crispr to

482
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Crispr out

483
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,711
The different parts of the elephant and put in woolly mammoth

484
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
If you can infect go backwards in Thai

485
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,879
Time and make changes in obviously I think you can go the other way to item mean

486
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Humans are

487
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
Good at design word designing animals

488
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
So if

489
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
It doesn't seem to me to be

490
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
Crazy notion to imagine parents all over the

491
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,216
Taller children so silencing the short jeans and

492
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
Favoring topology

493
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Getting rid of wheat

494
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
Muscles and going first

495
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Younger ones

496
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
I don't want it on and

497
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
And I don't know where the designing stop

498
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,504
We sorta got into all of this with

499
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Carl Zimmer

500
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
If

501
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
If you can

502
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Be very very Gene specific

503
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
And you learn more and more about jeans over

504
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Why couldn't you invent

505
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Why couldn't you make a

506
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,192
You might one day get supposed to get enough to do that there's no Wing in pig lab

507
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,568
You know is the best you can hope for right now is a woolly mammoth lab and that's down the hall from where the

508
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Where the

509
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
The real action is is it now there's a hall and at the end of the phone Tuesday wing it has not been built yet

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
It may be 20 years from now but that's what you looking at

511
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
Well yeah I think but the thing is

512
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Well because you can't make weight

513
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Winnie the Pooh

514
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Just because it's her evolutionary barrier

515
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
Okay well just forget stuff like except for the joke

516
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Okay I don't think that we need

517
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Federal

518
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Department

519
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Homeland

520
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,504
Spring security I think we're okay there all right

521
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
But we do need

522
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Is like

523
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
We do need to like figure out what are we going to do about

524
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Crispr

525
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
I mean they're going to be using crispr for cancer

526
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,304
Going to take me to take people's immune cells out of their body

527
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Unable to use crispr

528
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,448
To basically allow them to make proteins are going to be able to

529
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Grab onto

530
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Cancer cells

531
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
And attack their own cancer

532
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
We all have to be

533
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,920
What animal are you for

534
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Georgiou

535
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Uart Inc

536
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
You are tinkering with someone's own body

537
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
You are altering their own

538
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Selves

539
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Dude

540
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Where do I

541
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
It's just I can use it with this is

542
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
Meet I don't know if it's a religious thought or just

543
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
The thought of a conservative person

544
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
I'm not screw up in the

545
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
In a test tube baby error

546
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Now know many wonderful

547
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Adult farmer Lita

548
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
I remember being astonished

549
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Set

550
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
No soy

551
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't I don't know where the sacred

552
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Begins and ends

553
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
I'm not pretty

554
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
I guess what I'm instead on is I'm on

555
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
On

556
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
A hobbesian view of human beings

557
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
But there is something about

558
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
Human beings including scientist

559
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Volume

560
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096
There's a darkness and a light there

561
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
There's an Angelic side to Being Human on this

562
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Very very

563
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Difficult synonym

564
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
As the human beings get more and more

565
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Create and design and

566
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Creative

567
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Future

568
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
That future will include

569
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
The imagination

570
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
Both light and dark

571
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Humans

572
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
And that will be new in the world

573
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,392
I don't think it is new because if you go back to the start of the Scientific Revolution some like France

574
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
Does bacon with say explicitly like

575
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Science

576
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Is

577
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,840
Going to be both about learning about how the world works

578
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
And

579
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Using that knowledge

580
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
You know this has been discovered this is been published

581
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Everybody knows it

582
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,104
If you if you guys had a cocaine that we're going to all we're going to outlaw.

583
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm not the same

584
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
What what are you suggesting

585
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
Cringe Lewis one two three

586
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,184
What is it now

587
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
I don't know

588
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:09,120
We are permitted if that's where you are

589
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Ukraine

590
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
Shoe creams with attitude

591
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,568
Dial Beijing with with dragons

592
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
You're saying

593
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
You're saying oh my God

594
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,064
Forget to that conversation with Carl was 4 months ago

595
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,624
And a lot has happened

596
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
Pikachu the question that you asked

597
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Like where does the sacred

598
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
Christian and will one of the lines that have been drawn

599
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
By Jennifer down on others was that we should not

600
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Use the technology

601
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
Humans who haven't been born yet meaning not on sperm cells

602
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:50,848
Are egg cells because if you crispr say an embryo that is it that is a permanent change

603
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Right that is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children

604
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,808
And their children's children and their children's children's children you can't ask

605
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
The

606
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Person

607
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
If that's okay because you're doing it

608
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Before they're born

609
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Send

610
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
The real issue

611
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Imagine making these changes

612
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Cascade through generation after generation

613
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
You could affect the evolution of organism

614
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
And

615
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,752
I want to say trivial but it's you know it's fairly easy to do it

616
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
Kind of profound I feel it's really for

617
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
Profound profound but it was just an idea

618
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
That is until for the first time in history researchers in China have successfully edit the human genome and

619
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
An embryo just two months ago

620
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
It was announced that a Chinese team used a technique called crispr

621
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
In human embryos Evolution itself

622
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
The Chinese team they were not viable

623
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:59,712
You actually develop into a person so they're they're going to be discarded anyway still they can figure it out with those embryos what's the stop any

624
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
Boston ethical line

625
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
Just sort of thing could be serviced slippery slope towards

626
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Okay

627
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Now that the Grinch party

628
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
It's Fred and Robert didn't seem like

629
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
We called up Carl again

630
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
But we have to revisit we have to revisit because in our Armageddon conversation in which I believe I was

631
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
Extremely alarmist and You lyrics

632
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,832
Extremely down putting I feel that I should do a small little parade

633
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Cubby

634
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,768
Remember the Alamo remember remember China

635
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:50,400
And you have to close you should just begin anytime you want like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are going to start from there

636
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:58,080
I'm sorry so are we actually surrounded by an army of clones with soup

637
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Super powers

638
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,968
Yeah but I think the Dyke has been opened I believe I'm going to quote somebody who said

639
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,856
Maybe a few weeks ago I think you want me because last week you can writing for naturally

640
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
I think it was maybe with somebody

641
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Girl

642
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,256
Who said that the news from China and that news

643
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Probably

644
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
The beginning of an entire New Era and I think I actually said it was a historical moment

645
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
And I and I still stand by that

646
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
Do you feel differently now than the first time

647
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
I don't feel different

648
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Actually because

649
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Didn't really know

650
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Scientific

651
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Surprise here

652
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,064
He says people been doing all these crispr experiments and all these different mammals

653
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
We're mammals this is bounded

654
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,672
In fact it may be happening more than we think

655
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
One account in the journal Nature has said that

656
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
For other Chinese labs

657
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
What are doing this kind of work

658
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Carlyle Soto

659
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
Which she said was unsurprising to buttocks

660
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Rising

661
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,984
The crisper work the Chinese team did

662
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Didn't work very well

663
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
It works

664
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
Kind of

665
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
I mean in only a few of the cases

666
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Did they really get

667
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Exactly what they want

668
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,880
They tried using crispr in about 86 embryos and they only got to work right and maybe 28

669
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
A lot of them

670
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Mistress made the wrong cuts

671
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,304
Screwed up the cells and that led them to conclude that this is a technology that's not ready

672
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Right now for application in the humans

673
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
And

674
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
I agree

675
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
We still are in this kind of fortunate position where we can see it's dangerous

676
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
So we shouldn't

677
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Use it

678
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Animal human embryo

679
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
I just don't think that we're going to be able to certify find Refuge there in like 10 or 20 years and 10 or 20 years

680
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Crispr will be

681
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
So sophisticated

682
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
The people will be able to say

683
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
I can get you

684
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
The change you want

685
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
And I can do it safely

686
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,888
I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos at

687
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Have

688
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
The alteration in the

689
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
A particular Gene Yuan

690
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
So then what

691
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,872
Is that Jennifer doudna told us that this experiment similar experiments have been repeated in mice

692
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
With

693
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Moore Advanced crispr system

694
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Is it really there

695
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,784
There it was done with almost no air

696
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Sometimes I feel like we're certain

697
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
Displacing all are ethical concerns

698
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Onto

699
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Something that hasn't happened yet

700
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
We really are concerned about

701
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
What we're doing

702
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
The human gene pool

703
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
You know it's already here

704
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Take

705
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
As an example in vitro fertilization

706
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,496
About 60000 kids are born a year through IVF and

707
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Probable that

708
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Some of those

709
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:42,432
Parents chose what they wanted a boy or a girl and when people start doing IVF there was a huge controversy

710
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
See people said this was dangerous

711
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Unnatural

712
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
I don't see

713
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
People

714
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,624
Who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of IVF

715
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,720
You know I'm going to sound like I'm on Roberts out of this I mean okay so

716
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
So won't hurt

717
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
It will be alright

718
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
Are you okay so

719
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,008
So you guys know about all the stuff going on Iceland where they're looking

720
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
People's DNA and

721
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Another looking for

722
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Do these jeans and so on

723
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
And

724
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,480
When they're looking at these Icelandic people they found that some people

725
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
Had

726
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
A gene that

727
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Protect them

728
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Gets Alzheimer

729
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Reduces our odds of getting outside

730
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Let's imagine your doctor said

731
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Know if you

732
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Like for an extra $1,000

733
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,120
We will take these IVF embryos and we will

734
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Use crispr

735
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
To give them the Alzheimer

736
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Protecting

737
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Variant

738
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Would you like that

739
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
You want to add that to your to your procedure

740
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Or would you like your child to

741
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Two-Face

742
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Teacher of of

743
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Alzheimer's

744
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Your choice

745
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
Teachers might here's my thing here is anything with this hole

746
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,952
I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said which is

747
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
When it's not dangerous anymore

748
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
What will we

749
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
We do and I'm afraid we've already answered

750
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
It is not it's not a

751
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Question that's open

752
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Because if we're already doing this kind of

753
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
Stuff and who's going to say no to that

754
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
Who's going to say no to that

755
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
Yeah we've already answered the

756
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Yeah

757
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
We may have

758
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
So that's how we ended our peace

759
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
Just now two years old

760
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Broccoli

761
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,840
Roughly and the drunk biologists at Chad's cocktail party couldn't have been more pressure when you think about it

762
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,984
This is one of those this is one of those strange cases where like you do a story usually like we just going to leave it behind other things but

763
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
In the last

764
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Almost 2 years

765
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
So much has happened

766
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
So we figured we need to update this thing so what we did is we asked our produce return wheeler and our producer Molly Webb

767
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Just go out ask around make some calls and

768
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Ellis

769
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
You know

770
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
What's been going on

771
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,000
41 Molly do you want to give him the big news

772
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:09,632
The Jennifer Lopez is going to do a television show based on crispr

773
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
Give me an active role in the fictional narrative of the show

774
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:21,152
She's like something old something and crispr is involved

775
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:25,760
Really yeah where you at headlines

776
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,880
Wow it's crossover to that extent that's the thing is that gets the sum

777
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:37,280
And I like that I was like Jennifer Lopez knows about crispr and she was like this is such a hot-button issue Where do I

778
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
That's amazing

779
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Okay so so

780
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:47,520
Moving putting JLo aside science development have been quite a few

781
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
House right now what are those

782
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:54,176
I mean I guess I would just say that it's being used everywhere now so it's being used in crops

783
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
It's being used in medicine it's being used in basic research

784
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
It's being used hermansau and humans being used in eyeballs

785
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Clinical trial with actually injecting a syringe full of crispr carrying viruses into your eye

786
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Eyeball to overcome a genetic condition

787
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:18,240
What leads to blindness to this would be like with the viruses injecting the crisper the thing goes and cuts out the bad genes

788
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Exactly just take

789
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,872
You know a big syringe full of viruses and just stick it in people's eyes

790
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
Yes so course when we did the update

791
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,016
Soren and I called Carl Zimmer

792
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
Things are moving very fast

793
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
And what kind

794
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Thanks so

795
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
They are

796
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Doing things that look like

797
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
Curing diseases so Carl told us about one study

798
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Where

799
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,864
It seems like they cured a certain type of muscular dystrophy in mice

800
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,448
Cured must be cured muscular dystrophy in mice

801
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,800
Wow well then might not become normal nice but they get much much stronger

802
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,640
Then they would have been yeah so in your body you have a gene

803
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
That makes a protein that gives your muscle

804
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,016
Full strength but with muscular dystrophy

805
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
There's like

806
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
Typos in that Gene a mutation into that proteins not made and the result is that

807
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,744
Your muscles start to turn into sort of a

808
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
Fat-like substance

809
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
Has been described no power

810
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,496
Yeah okay so your diaphragm gets weaker and weaker your heart gets weaker so in this case they use crispr

811
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
To fix that Jean

812
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
So you get

813
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Protein in these mice

814
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
I actually saw

815
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
At the heart get stronger or the mouse

816
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
Was able to push with more Force

817
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,368
I'm button until they said over weeks they just saw like strength-building up

818
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
Are they going to do that humans pretty first

819
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
Pretty First Step be at this point but yeah this is one of the first experiments to show that this approach could work

820
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,168
Muscular dystrophy vitamin that's not a disease

821
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
With a cure is it not until

822
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
Potentially in mice now yeah

823
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,128
And there are some human trials that it be there

824
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
Started or

825
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,040
I probably going to start soon treating cancer example people are talking about one and lung cancer

826
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
What

827
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,904
Sure lung cancer or no

828
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
What they want to do though is they want to

829
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,584
Use crispr to go into immune cells where would cut out the part of the DNA that

830
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
How to put the brake on the immune cell

831
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
And

832
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,472
So you're you're taking your immune cell off the leash

833
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
And

834
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
I can attack

835
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
Tumors

836
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Marc Gasol

837
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,760
So the folks who invented this then must stand to earn a fortune

838
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
There's actually a big patent

839
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Dispute

840
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,440
That's happening right now so one of the guys know this is the one thing that I have heard

841
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:50,048
About a lot of you had been checking your crispr inbox you might have seen last week

842
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
There were two teams

843
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
Jennifer doudna steam out at UC Berkeley from the West Coast team and then on the other side

844
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,592
Is this group of researchers at the broad Institute

845
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
Witches on East Coast

846
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,528
And so basically they both filed for a crispr patent so there was sort of this like

847
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
East Coast West Coast

848
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
For the last

849
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Year

850
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,672
Showdown and just last week

851
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
The US patent office decided

852
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,840
That it would indeed go to produce is the not doubting

853
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,680
The not doubt the team but there are more patent super awarded

854
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,520
And there will probably be a peel so I don't think anyone thinks it's settled yet

855
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
So in the Civil War of

856
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,896
Over over crispr patents

857
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
There has been a Gettysburg

858
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
There are many more battles

859
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
What happened

860
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Gacha

861
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,672
Is there is there anything else on the on the list of like What's Happening Now exciting stuff happening now

862
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
Oh yeah

863
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,072
Can we do favorite strike and I do kind you're my favorite and then you can do your favorite

864
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,400
My my favorite came from Carl

865
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
Yeah yeah they're actually trying to use it

866
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
As an alternative to antibiotics

867
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
We're headed to know what I'm saying that means

868
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,968
What do you say eyes like an antibiotic to me is a pill that I tell you

869
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
So what would crispr Howard crispr replace that

870
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Well you

871
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
Your pill would have crispr in it

872
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,464
How how would it work you know in the same way you would take your amoxicillin or your antibiotic pill

873
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
You would actually take a pill that was filled with crispr

874
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,120
And then it would go out and it was fight bacteria

875
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
That is attacking your body

876
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,264
So you could pick out you know some super essential Gene that it has

877
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
And chop it

878
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
And that will kill the bacteria

879
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:43,200
Oh you would turn the Assassins on the bacteria exactly

880
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
So there you go

881
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,880
Yeah the antibiotics thing seems huge right cuz everyone's at this moment where they're like what happens with the Neck Road for bug

882
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,720
If you could actually just go in there and Kamikaze the DNA of like

883
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,792
Staff or whatever he'd be solving a lot of illness

884
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,704
Yeah but what's what what's your fave

885
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
Maybe the scariest to hi Kevin how are you I'm doing great how are you

886
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Kevin esvelt

887
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
I'm at the MIT media lab

888
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:21,088
He was sort of on the early edge of thinking about crispr I meant I think of myself as an evolutionary engineer before anything

889
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,672
Got into biology because when he was a kid he went to the Galapagos

890
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
My parents took me there when I was

891
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
10 or so and I was just captivated

892
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
Just looking all the creatures and I thought I want to make organisms that are as beautiful as that

893
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,448
You actually thought I want to make organisms as beautiful as that

894
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
1

895
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
That's like the childhood vision and then it's so hard right

896
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,848
Forget it

897
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
And but now with crispr like

898
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Almost like All Things become possible

899
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
So anyway to get to the crazy part Kevin couple years back he's working at the Harvard Medical School and one day

900
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,184
He's walking to work through this some the spark this

901
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Park called the emerald necklace

902
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
In Boston

903
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,584
It's beautiful and there's a small river flowing through it and you have these

904
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,192
Ponds with turtles in whatever giesen and you know he's thinking about

905
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
Crispr and what he can do and all these

906
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
Animals that are around him

907
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
And he has this

908
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
This thought

909
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
What if

910
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
We could

911
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
Encode crispr

912
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
In the genome

913
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
What if we

914
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,064
Program The genome to genome editing on it

915
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Own

916
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,720
Wait what what I'm I'm I'm not sure if all that what is it what is he saying well

917
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
The first

918
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Gene drives

919
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Maybe this is the way to think about it

920
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,376
Let's say that you want to tweak a mosquito

921
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
And make it so that the

922
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
Little parasite that carries malaria terrible awful malaria

923
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
Either can't get into the mosquito or can't live in it until that mosquito will no longer carry malaria that would be great that would be a great day

924
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,968
Think is malaria is a bad thing so you could now take crispr

925
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,088
I send it into the mosquito and change the gene inside the mosquito so now that mosquito either

926
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
Doesn't let malaria parasite in or kills it or whatever but basically doesn't carry it and that's great

927
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,792
Right but then I put it on to the wildness got us

928
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:12,448
And for itself amongst all the other mosquitoes so my mosquito has a special Gene but it's going to mate with some mom

929
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Mosquito

930
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,776
And that Mom is he doesn't have the normal old Jean

931
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,616
And the baby's going to get my specialty but it's also going to get the normal

932
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
Gene and that means that your baby has like a 50% chance

933
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Having your

934
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
Special training of because

935
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
Only one of those two genes gets

936
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
Sprite in the baby and then in the Next Generation the grandbaby there's only a 25% chance and you know on and

937
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
On and on

938
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
So you're exponentially losing Chris

939
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,168
Superpowers your chances just each generation get less and less of this Gene is going to stick around that's right because

940
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
Regardless of what we do natural selection wins in the end

941
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,616
Until Kevin is walking to work through the park and has his idea which is to use

942
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
Crispr to create something called

943
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Gene Drive

944
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
I came to drop yeah

945
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,855
Instead of just skip the DNA and insert a gene that we want

946
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,183
Also insert the genes that encode the crispr system

947
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
And tell it to make that particular change

948
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Here's how it works

949
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:14,399
You go into the mosquito and give it the new Gene that makes it resistant to malaria

950
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
And then right next to that

951
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
You put the jeans for the

952
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:23,359
Crispr system you just used to make that change a spare scissors or something

953
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,967
An insurance how that plays out your first mosquito has this Gene with the new change

954
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,063
And it also has the scissors yeah I'm going to meet some normal mosquito which has the normal

955
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,087
The two end up

956
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
Side by side in the baby

957
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,999
Now the new mosquito Gene makes the Little Caesars which go over to the normal Gene

958
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Snip it

959
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
And turn it into itself

960
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
So now there's two copies

961
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
Of the new Gene in The Offspring without

962
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Any human assistance

963
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
Crispr will cut

964
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Original version

965
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
And copy over the change

966
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
That Jean does the work that I used to do in the lab

967
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
On its own inside the baby

968
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,295
So interesting to okay so like I set it on autopilot

969
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
So you're basically allowing the mosquito

970
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Parent

971
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,719
Pass the scissors to the baby don't we send snip snip snip

972
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
And then that baby passes the scissors to the next baby up nip snap it is literally like a chain reaction yeah

973
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
So you know

974
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,263
From 82 grandbaby to Great grandbaby now instead of letting that Gene disappear

975
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
You're driving it into the Next Generation

976
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,943
That just keeps going down the line down the line down the line

977
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
This is something that spreads

978
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Indefinitely

979
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:41,439
This Gene is going to spread like wildfire through the entire wild populations you don't change

980
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
Just one mosquito

981
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
All of those insects probably everywhere in the world

982
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:51,423
According to Kevin this is the kind of change that could given enough time

983
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
Spread across the entire

984
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Species

985
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
So this

986
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
This idea of mosquitoes and

987
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,711
Watching Rampage true population of the dumbness

988
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
After we had four

989
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Publish the idea

990
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
We tried it in East

991
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Work on the first try

992
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
They just popped a little yeast loaded with the gene drive into a population to see if it would take over and

993
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
One week later

994
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Yep

995
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
Kevin told us they're probably now I think it's

996
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,447
10 different groups who are working on Gene Drive systems yes they are doing it

997
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:29,311
And mosquitoes and in parasitic worms and in rodents

998
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,639
It's all happening in the lab is still they are

999
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Trying out

1000
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
You know

1001
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,527
Dismiss method for spreading genes through a population

1002
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Yeah

1003
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
I just think that sounds terrifying

1004
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:45,183
Like honestly I just keep thinking of it's like oh we've we've just

1005
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,559
Hit over a domino and then walked away and aren't watching where the rest of them are falling

1006
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
I'm very glad you think that was me one full day

1007
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
The reach that point

1008
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Initially I was slated

1009
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:03,103
Let me tell you there is nothing like the she relation of Discovery I think you know this is the end of malaria this is the end of every

1010
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Hangouts mosquitoes spread

1011
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
Wait a minute no ticks spread Lyme disease we can probably get rid of that too

1012
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:13,599
I thought in the morning you're like you're singing to the turtles in the in the parking

1013
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,183
Pretty much a full day of being

1014
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Who

1015
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,255
And then I started thinking but but

1016
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
But

1017
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
But

1018
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
What if something goes wrong

1019
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
And supposed

1020
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
Go back to your malaria case

1021
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,263
Make mosquitoes malaria resistant well that seems

1022
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
Pretty safe I mean malaria is a human

1023
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Pathogen

1024
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Doesn't really affect

1025
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Other animals

1026
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
But what if

1027
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
Say the change you make to the mosquito

1028
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,831
Makes it slightly more toxic something to eat so

1029
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
When you have to contend with those mosquitoes in

1030
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
Boasting

1031
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
You know it could be that all the frogs are the Fisher whatever start to die off and then that make something else die off and something else

1032
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
I'll stay off

1033
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
Credibly complex system and you just you just don't know or if you could be that making a mosquito malaria

1034
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
Deer resistant also somehow

1035
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
Makes it do better in some environment than the mosquito population blows up and then it turns out that it somehow makes it

1036
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Easier to carry some

1037
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Other disease

1038
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
So

1039
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
And yours are more likely to go wrong

1040
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
But

1041
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
How do you know we should say at this point that Kevin is

1042
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
Really thinking about all the stuff he brought together a group of scientists to come up with some safeguards for this type of Reese

1043
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Research so doesn't

1044
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
Escape out of the lab and and his team is only working with this version of Gene Drive the day

1045
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Pacer rigged it

1046
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,455
So that it only lasts for certain number generations and it's her runs out of steam but

1047
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Scientist

1048
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
Can perfectly well

1049
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
Start playing around with something in the lab

1050
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
That could affect a whole lot of other people

1051
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
What happened to ask

1052
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
I think what this

1053
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
Technology forces us to reckon with

1054
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Is that now it's

1055
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Ffbe Reddit

1056
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
We don't know for sure but

1057
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
Theoretically possible for one person

1058
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Decide

1059
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
To change the local

1060
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,103
Possibly the global environment

1061
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
And that

1062
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,503
Ethically problematic race

1063
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:24,159
I mean if if and when somebody uses crispr

1064
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,719
An embryo and that embryo grows up into a person

1065
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,863
That will be a momentous thing but if you were to Gene Drive somebody

1066
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
Think about that

1067
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:38,495
Can a gene Drive likes a few people in and. Tell them in

1068
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
You don't have kids and someone like

1069
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
And you'd be driving

1070
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,175
Whatever Gene it is that you were engineering midterm or more people

1071
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,711
I'm and

1072
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
That's

1073
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
That's different

1074
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
God you know what I'm thinking about

1075
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,671
Thing that Jennifer doudna said I think it was her in our first piece of

1076
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,023
Like if you make a change and say an embryo like you looking to give this to me snip snip snip give this

1077
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Future child

1078
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Make it all alright

1079
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
Whatever

1080
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
Like you're doing that without the consent of that Unborn

1081
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,543
Yes but if you if you know do what you guys are talking about using this Gene Drive thing

1082
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Well now your

1083
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
Doing it without the consent of that unborn thing and all future generations of that unborn thing and to the consent issues

1084
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Just become like

1085
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
Unfathomable

1086
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
Exactly

1087
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
You know I guess we're all for taller

1088
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
But

1089
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,159
All for taller

1090
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,559
Show me and it has something to do with democracy itself like you sit there with a tool

1091
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
A change in your hand and you choose it but in the act of the with his truck in

1092
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
Any active choosing it for yourself this way you choose it for an uncountable number of others who do not have the

1093
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,007
Thanks you too storm wheeler Molly Webster for the update

1094
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,103
And the people we think the first time cuz of snakes still

1095
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
The band

1096
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,015
Many thanks to science writer Carl Zimmer many books
