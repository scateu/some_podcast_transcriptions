00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
I think I think there's a lot of moments in your life that you find yourself doing something

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,744
Anybody in here my name is Brittany would love to be able to talk with you

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
And you take that moment and step back from it

7
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,216
And you realize what the f*** am I doing

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
What just happened was this real I think that was one of those moments

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod iron rubber Co which is Radiolab in today on the podcast

10

Really we're going to do a ghost story at Halloween dude well you don't even know where to just listen

12
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
This one comes to my producer Matt kielty yet so I first heard the story from a buddy of mine

13
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
His name is Dennis Conroe dentist

14
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Eddie what's up dude Mills total beds

15
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
Will Dennis yes about a lot of things but in particular

16
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
House

17
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
So let's let's start with the house when did you move back in with Steve I was probably I don't know

18
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
2010 college

19
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Yep by the way what did you what did you study

20
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Creative writing

21
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
Yeah I just got I just kind of got bored there

22
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Going to stop going to class

23
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,544
I think what's my parents realize that they weren't very happy and

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
I would assume so and so

25
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,200
Set yeah I was kind of asked to come back home

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Back to town just outside Kansas City towns called Grandview I did I did

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,696
And the house was fairly old at about a hundred and five

28
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Years old at the time a White House nice little porch awning over a farmhouse style

29
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,216
You were at your parents home equity in your in your old bedroom and my old childhood bedroom

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Yasso

31
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
There was always a sense of like I need to get out of this house it's holding you back somehow

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
So I got a job

33
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Bruker job and got

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Laid off

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
And when you're turned into two and then 3 then 4 then 5 it was not that great

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
Time to be there in what way just that I felt like I was

37
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Still

38
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
16

39
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
He says he's over here is mom telling people on the phone why don't you know you never got to move out Izzy

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
She started circling classifieds jobs for typists printing press sales rep typesetter

41
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,504
I think everything in my life however I

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Mean for it not to sort of moves at my own snail's pace

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Eventually really old like 27 maybe actually he was 28 after eight years in this house

44
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,704
Dennis gets the job finds his apartment this ratty 6 Plex apartment

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
But

46
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Right when he said to move out

47
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
Finally home my mom got really sick

48
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,200
Dance mom is in remission from breast cancer for like 9 years but that summer

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Her doctors

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Told her that didn't return and that's bread

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Quite a bit

52
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
So

53
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
I said to hurt like a

54
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Do you do you want me to

55
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Be here or do you want me to

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Go

57
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
And she was like well you know if this is my time

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
She wants to go knowing that her kids can take care of themselves

59
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
Spend this moved out about 5 months later

60
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
She went pretty fast

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,016
Vons or so after my mom died my dad found out he had stage 4 prostate cancer

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,160
And he was really too sick to take care of the house and just be the guy by himself at that point

63
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,744
Now that's pretty much had to come home I take care of him

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
3-4 times a week

65
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Ed

66
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Has he got worse

67
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
Kid said to me like hey let's try to find you a house to buy so that I can teach you how to like

68
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Do all of the kind of stuff that one has to do men know how to do things like change out Plumbing

69
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
All this kind of stuff and so we put an offer on a house that fell through and before they can find

70
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
Something else for cancer from his prostate

71
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,183
Spread to his brain and you're the last week of his life he was really

72
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Not there

73
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
I can remember

74
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
One day like maybe maybe a week or so after he died walking through the empty

75
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Kitchen and

76
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
There was so much stuff there was so much stuff

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
Papers all over the place junk mail all over the kitchen floor

78
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Down in the basement tools all over the place

79
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Yeah I had this moment of

80
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Yeah

81
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Here are his tools and I

82
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
And now I

83
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,487
Have them in my hands and you know I just remembered taking up this

84
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
Clawhammer and just crying

85
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
Cuz this is my hammer

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
This is now my house is now

87
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
My

88
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Problem

89
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
But few days pass

90
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
And clean it out

91
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Soap

92
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
At age 32 junk in the basement but that stuff on the curb sale after c

93
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Sale after sale horrible

94
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Headed meant to replace it before he died but you know

95
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Finish my thought was like oldest to this one bathroom so it looks pretty good to sell

96
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Daddy never showed him how to

97
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
Doing it at stuff that point that I was like hell YouTube

98
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
And begin with your ceramic tile Nippers Michigan online or not I'll just Plumbing any redid the bathroom

99
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,951
And turned out pretty good it was kind of fun and then the next thing I knew I was taking wallpaper off of the kitchen

100
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Flats got to go hardwood floors insulation to attic glass block windows in the basement

101
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
I turned into the whole house

102
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
How long does that take

103
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
5 years

104
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Actually it was 6

105
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
Well he says the whole time he was doing this renovation

106
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
At night

107
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
I would have these dreams where

108
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
My parents just kind of came through the back door and it was just like a what are you doing here

109
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Oh that's right your your dad and then I would turn my

110
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
My back and then

111
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
They would have

112
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Somehow

113
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
Undone all of the things that I did

114
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
All they had brought the house back to where it what

115
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
State it was in when they were alive

116
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
And I probably had this dream I'm not kidding like at least a hundred times wow

117
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,271
Night after night after night just kept going on and on and

118
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Ultimately kind of

119
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
Drove me crazy until one day after yet another one of these dreams Dennis is finally like

120
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
All right

121
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
I'm selling it

122
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
Put it up in the markets waiting for a buyer

123
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
And then

124
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Something

125
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Strange happens

126
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Well something kind of strange I made this

127
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
Friend and she came over for the first time

128
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
Lady friend on a date you taking her back to your house and so

129
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Improvements until she was in

130
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
The kitchen right by the basement door in the kitchen

131
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
When she was like there's some kind of weird presents here

132
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
And I was just like okay well that was kind of sign that was not going to last.

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,519
Fast forward a few years didn't really think too much about it until one day Dennis's realtor is having an open house

134
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
No one shows so she was in the house by yourself and then it starts getting these

135
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,223
Text messages from her dude your house is haunted

136
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Like I can hear people

137
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
Walking around and

138
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
She texted that there was

139
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
Definitely something weird going on right by the basement door that's the same spot

140
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
That's that's kind of weird

141
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
But then here's the crazy thing called friend is in Eastlake

142
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
Hey funny thing to different people two separate occasions

143
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
They come over to the house

144
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
And they said they felt this weird

145
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Presents and she was like wait right by the basement door get out

146
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
So I got Heather I got Stacey on that Carla all three

147
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,159
To say they feel this weird presents consider yourself a bit of a skeptic about such things

148
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
I would say so rashly I'm just going to say no

149
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
So you don't believe in ghosts no all right what happened next

150
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
This also having to be right at the time that I

151
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,263
Sold the house Dennis to finally put the pen to paper signed the contract packed up all stuff

152
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,895
And so Carla the girl that first felt this thing because he went on a date with think they stay friends

153
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
Sad to me like

154
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
You know I'm

155
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Really curious about this

156
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,647
Would you mind if I call like these ghosts people to comment late check-out

157
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671

00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Place

159
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719

Yeah I'm just kind of walking through the house I think I got this on tape of just media walking through the house

167
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
Like we'll probably a waste of time but I'm

168
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
Still kind of curious about it it's Friday night right it's a Friday night midnight

Right off the bat

174
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
The only first got here

175
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
We both saw

176
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
A woman looking out the window

177
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
So what did she look like

178
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
I didn't really see what you look like

179
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Headlighting lawn repair it was like gray and

180
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
She was wearing one of those weird old timey dresses

181
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Dennis was like whatever

182
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,527
They set up cameras the basement in the kitchen in the clairvoyants had they wanted to try to talk

183
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
To this woman

184
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Any other scared in the house

185
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
Tell Brittany she's like the ringleader of the night she sort of explained how she does things

186
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
Things you know she was like the best way

187
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
That she could get them to talk to to to them was through flashlights

188
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
What to do if they take a few flashlights turn him on

189
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Enemy unscrew the tops of them

190
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Juice

191
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
So that they turn off

192
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,223
Let me just kind of set the flashlights that better now off

193
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
In the room by themselves

194
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
The idea is that if

195
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Ghost of the spirit wants to communicate

196
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Distorted

197
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
Touch the top of one of the flashlights with their dosti finger

198
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
And I'll turn it back on

199
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
It's not that you are

200
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
And I was like okay

201
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
So she took three flashlights

202
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
And we all sat in this dark room in a circle

203
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Okay and precept flashlights in the middle of circle by themselves

204
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,647
And she says Brittany

205
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
I love to be able to talk with you

206
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Can you turn on the lights on

207
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
And reset their me sit there

208
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Are you here

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
Then all the sudden this light

210
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
Kind of been sleeping song

211
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
And then she said okay

212
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Thank you

213
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Please turn it off

214
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
I'm going to goes off

215
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,671
What we can do with these lights here is if I can ask her then she says we have three

216
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
Lights you're the one you just turned on will call you us

217
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,095
Please turn on one more and that will be no

218
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
And then a

219
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Second light comes on

220
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
No way any the room like looking for somebody who has like a little switch or something

221
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
These people so they have no reason to fake this I suppose but now I just keep thinking well

222
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Houses close to the

223
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,183
Train tracks that maybe maybe the train vibrations of the train

224
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
But all the sudden they were like

225
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Can you hear that

226
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Footsteps

227
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
And they're going towards the kitchen

228
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,223
And I can hear

229
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,343
Dishes rattling on the countertop in the kitchen

230
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
No one's in the kitchen no one's in the kitchen

231
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,743
If you're in the kitchen right now can you turn one of these lights on

232
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Teresa didn't stare at these three flashlights

233
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
Then

234
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
I'm leaving the room what happened

235
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Well I actually

236
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Everyone

237
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Everyone in that room

238
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Died

239
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
Except for Dennis

240
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
I have no idea why I even invited you into this building

241
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Not. Actually they're fine

242
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,175
It turns out that I there was a guy downstairs in the basement one of the techies walking around

243
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
Pitch black down there and he just like bangs his head until I can air duct in the Sounders reverberated throughout the whole house

244
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,975
Jennifer Lopez it was very Blair Witch

245
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
Anyhow the techies is that they want to

246
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Get the three psychics down in the basement by themselves and so you know

247
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,847
These three women go down in the basement by themselves kind of cure them downstairs talking but we don't really know what's going on

248
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
They come back upstairs and they said

249
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
She was definitely down there he'll woman the Fate first saw when I got to the house

250
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,535
And they said that she was standing down in the basement next to where the old furnace used to be

251
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,143
Middle Tennessee she said that she lived here for a long time and then it's like in a second

252
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
You knew that back in the thirties or something a woman has lived in this house

253
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Who

254
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Was kind of not all there

255
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
And one day she turned down into the basement and thought she was picking

256
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Lice

257
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Off of chickens in throwing them in this big furnace that was downstairs in the basement at the time she got a little teeth

258
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,207
Close the furnace Story Goes caught herself on fire and then died there

259
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
I guess in the basement

260
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,375
But then there was another man downstairs to show himself to me but he won't

261
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Pop music completely disappeared

262
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
What did he look like

263
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
He was bald

264
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
News about Rick site but it wasn't right

265
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,711

267
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Not a lot but

268
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Similar

269
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Definitely

270
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
If I were to show you a picture of

271
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
My father

272
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,999
Would you have any sense of this with him

273
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
If I saw a picture of them yeah baby

274
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839

275
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,263

276
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
Yep that's man I saw

277
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
If she's very hesitant at the beginning just like I should jump in here really quick and tell you that this was actually

278
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
The first time that Dennis has ever listened to this tape

279
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Really yeah in the reason is cuz for long time

280
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Didn't want to listen to it

281
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Why

282
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,423
Part of it had to do with this moment because this is the point where my

283
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Skepticism kind of ticked off

284
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Part of it had to do with

285
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
What happens next

286
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823

00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
But

358
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,008
I said what have you been able to see the things I've done to the house

359
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
And

360
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,872
Both of the lights lit up very brightly yes

361
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,224
And then so looking for 6 years

362
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,064
Redone the house I've done a lot of things he only said

363
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Precinct are you

364
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,464
Happy with this are you happy with the things I've done at the house they both look very brightly yes

365
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
And

366
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
I said are you

367
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Proud of me

368
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Be proud of

369
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Black dog

370
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Clam

371
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
So in a few days guys

372
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
I'll probably never set foot in this house again.

373
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,864
I don't want you to stay here and feel

374
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
When you belong here I want you to Clearwater Beach

375
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Free

376
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Can you

377
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Coco's house

378
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
I am going to

379
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Recognize

380
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
The Haunting my dreams a lot

381
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
That's very important to you

382
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,200
That's where it ends

383
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
That's how I Call of Duty

384
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Exactly like that

385
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
And

386
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
Yeah kind of teared up

387
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,752
Keep in mind that this was the first time that didn't heard this tape and so

388
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
He played it back to him

389
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
Cuz we just wanted to see you like

390
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,968
How we remember that experience I guess part of part of part of my fear

391
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
I'll listen to it was that it would change it

392
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
And that it would be a different

393
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
Experience it would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more

394
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
Unclear what was happening but

395
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Listen to it again

396
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Yeah it was

397
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
As I recall it being

398
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Sonia does he believe he was

399
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Actually talking to his

400
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Dead parents

401
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
No

402
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,384
No I ended up actually

403
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
Calling this guy who explained to me

404
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
How this whole flashlight thing

405
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Works and that there is

406
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
A perfectly non paranormal explanation

407
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
As to what's going on with the flashlight almost Goes Bad Manners at this point to have a pact with me but I'm very curious to hear it

408
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
What's going on is you turn the flashlight on

409
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,448
When you turn the flashlight on the bulb gets really hot

410
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,264
When you take the top of the flashlight and you unscrew it

411
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Just like enough that the flashlight flickers off

412
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Flashlight off

413
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
And the bulb it got really hot to the inside of the flashlight also got really hot and there's this little piece of plastic inside the Flash

414
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,088
Flashlight it when it got hot it expanded

415
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,488
And now is the flooding since the flashlight off that piece of plastic it starts to cool down and starts the contraction we can track

416
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
He pushes these two

417
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
Tiny bits of metal together

418
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,656
The two little bits of metal come into contact and that's your circuit

419
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,568
Did the circuit open the light bulb it goes back on or that it warms again

420
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Dysplastic it starts in the hottest Spanish people chose this flashlight because it had that

421
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:38,368
Particular property do you think it's like a condor something no I don't think so no I don't think so I mean

422
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,000
He's like I think they're just trying to make sense of Randomness I mean they don't I don't think you necessarily know that this flashlight

423
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
Does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people here's my don't think it's a car

424
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,424
Because in this case it's such a it's such a

425
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Strange

426
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Coincidence

427
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,080
The whenever he wants his mom and dad his ghostly mother and father

428
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
To approve of him

429
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
And congratulate him

430
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
And honor him

431
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
With a yes

432
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
Miss Random you could get a nobody gets a yes

433
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
It's just chance

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
And util Dancehall

435
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
Yeah I told that it's cuz you told me to tell that it's true

436
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,120
Okay so when you told him what did he say

437
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Well

438
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
I want level like it didn't phase him

439
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
Denim Paisley said like look I know I know

440
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
That

441
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:35,968
The way that the world works is the way the world Works people don't come back from the tab

442
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
People don't talk to you through

443
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Flashlights

444
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
He also said that like he's not

445
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
Going to let go of

446
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
That experience

447
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,328
He wants to have it both ways I guess so I guess I guess I would have both yes this didn't happen and yes this apps

448
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Truly happened

449
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
I understand that

450
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,752
Even if you are the world's biggest skeptic if you don't believe in ghosts like

451
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
There

452
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Really aren't that many ways

453
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,664
Talk about these sorts of things these are the things that we all feel

454
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
You know guilt for free

455
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,040
Things are becoming our past the loss of those who

456
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Will Be Loved

457
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
That like ghost stories kind of seem to stick around because

458
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
They aren't experienced

459
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
I'll be at like a metaphorical experience experience

460
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
But let's talk about these things that we

461
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Can't adequately talk about

462
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,448
You know that feeling of being haunted

463
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Anticipated he eventually sell the house move out of the house moved out no more dreams

464
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
Parents haunting him

465
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
In the time that I sold the house

466
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Now

467
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,112
I thought the dreams would stop

468
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
And now

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
The dreams are the

470
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,024
I'm the one haunting The House of the new people

471
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
Or I will just walk in

472
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Hear the

473
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
What are you like

474
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
Going around repairing things

475
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Nope I'm just

476
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,056
Like being somewhat shocked at what they've done to it

477
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
It's like it never stops you

478
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Not guilty

479
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,792
And if you want to know a little bit more little more detail about the flashlight trick

480
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,608
Snarly tracking flashlight phenomenon

481
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:32,960
Check it out on our website radiolab.org Mexican food

482
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Asterid explained in Greater detail

483
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
And also you can see some pictures of Dennis's house

484
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
Yeah that's all we can say at this

485
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:49,856
Holiday moment at their names I guess I'm Jedi Cam'ron and Robert krulwich thanks for listening
