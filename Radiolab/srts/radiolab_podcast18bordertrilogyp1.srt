1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,808
Which is Radiolab and let's just

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
What does okay cool

5
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,928
With a reporter and producer lots of knots

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
I think the best place to begin it sounds like

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Is in 2008 so this is Jason De Leon I am an associate professor

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,752
Master of anthropology at the University of Michigan I direct the undocumented migration Prague

9
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,336
But back in 2018 Jason and actually just finished

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,432
And my doctoral dissertation was on ancient stone tools

11
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Holistic Industries

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
San Lorenzo tenochtitlan

13
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,368
An economic and technological studies about as far removed as you can be from

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,024
The stuff that I'm doing right now using a city in technological data from 11 domestic and non-domestic auntie

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,376
Explain json was on his way to being an archaeologist

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
So she would go out into the field you these digs

17
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Parts of Mexico and find these little fragments of Old Stone tools to study focuses primarily on

18
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Percussion flake

19
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,248
Dating back to about a thousand BC industry that is often ignored in Mesoamerican lithic analysis

20
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
And then you would write these

21
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,600
Papers by comparing differences

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
In the frequencies

23
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
A various tool type

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
Journal

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
Search said really did a handful of people agreed

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
But

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Like many academics and I can say this cuz I wasn't academic the study also finds

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Introduction

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
An adoption

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Prismatic blade

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
He had this moment we're just kind of

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Hit the wall

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
Like okay this is enough I'm not I'm not doing this

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
I want nothing to do with it

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
You know when I finish my dissertation I had really become

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Kind of disillusion with the work that I was doing and I have no idea what I was going to do I remember telling my wife at one point I feel really bad I feel like

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Wasted the last 10 years of my life doing archaeology

38
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
And to make matters worse I taken his job at University of Washington it's just got in his job where he was supposed to teach the very thing

39
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
Yeah it's just like

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Dove just an exit just a

41
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Full-blown crisis

42
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
But then

43
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
States Dept

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
Will json Was preparing for one of his freshman classes

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,808
Someone handed him a book writer named Luis Alberto urrea call the devil's The Devil's Highway

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass so sunstruck

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
They didn't know their own names

48
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
Going to remember where they come from

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
Had forgotten how long they been lost

50
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
One of them wondered backup a peek

51
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
One of them was barefoot

52
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
They were burned nearly black

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Your lips huge

54
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
McCracken

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
The Devil's Highway is actually Willits

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
It's a true story

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,624
326 men who came to the US hiking their way through the Arizona desert

58
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
14 of them died along the way as I start reading it and

59
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
Visions of Home flooded through their minds

60
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Soft green bushes

61
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Waterfalls

62
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
Children did you shock me I mean I knew a lot about the Border least I thought I did

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
You know tell Texas my parents were immigrants

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
But just I couldn't believe that

65
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
That's

66
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
You know that this was

67
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,248
This is somebody's world they were drunk from having their brains baked in the past

68
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
They were saying God and Devil days and days of walking

69
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,952
I'm running out of food they were dizzy from drinking their own urine you know dying of thirst

70
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Poisons clogging your system

71
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
And a certain point Jason comes across this past

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
Where the author is describing the things that were in these men's pocket

73
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
Belt buckle with a fighting cock inlay

74
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,408
One wallet in the right front pocket of his Gino to change some keys and silver belt buckle fake silver watch

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
1 km

76
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
You know these personal effects green handkerchief

77
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
And he's trying to reconstruct

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
The story about who these men were that died from

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
From exposure John Doe number 42

80
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
Pure jeans

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Colored piece of paper

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
Jason says when you read that book

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Alight

84
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
I thought I bought a plane ticket a month later I was in the Arizona desert

85
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,847
Jason gets out to Tucson Arizona and he manages to convince

86
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
Someone from a local NGO to basically like showing around and be his guide but I said

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
I want to look at the stuff in my turtle leaving in the desert

88
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,695
Cuz I already want to see this FAQ real deep into the desert and see what you what you're made of

89
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Misguided ran me through the wringer

90
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
That part of the Sonoran Desert

91
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
Is Haley covered in sagebrush

92
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
Cacti everywhere red sand

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,543
Jason said certain point in a few hours in the height

94
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
They walked a distinct line and got to this Rich where they could

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
He'll look out over this huge expanse

96
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Just imagine like a

97
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
A ravine or a wash

98
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
Jason says he suddenly noticed that the desert ground below them

99
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Was just

100
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Hubbard Inn

101
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
Stop over a thousand backpacks and water bottles at me

102
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Well what ends up happening is

103
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Stuff gets left behind

104
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
For a couple of different reasons

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,055
If you're in route you might throw something out because you get so tired in your bag just get so heavy

106
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,359
I know things are kind of sprinkle to posses migrant Trail

107
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
But once you get to the end

108
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Pastor checkpoint

109
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,271
Your Smuggler said okay we're safe now we got to a new road we can get picked up someone else

110
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,855
Will show up in the truck and then they will say alright the 30 of you get into the van

111
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Leave everything behind

112
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
Change your clothes so it doesn't look like you just walked for 2 weeks to this desert

113
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,863
Until when groups are moving really big you would see things of size of like football fields of just

114
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Stuff everywhere

115
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,471
Gatorade bottles Bibles photographs

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Toys

117
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,335
The kind of random things that you might throw in your bag and say I'm leaving

118
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
My home forever and annie's I think I want to take with me

119
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,967
You know you busy think like a diaper bag or a baby bottle

120
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
And you wonder my God

121
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
You know who

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Who just came through this

123
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
And what's

124
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
What happened to them

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
So

126
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
For the next several years Jason just keep going back to this stretch of the Sonoran Desert close to closing

127
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
Gathering whatever he could find dirty socks and

128
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,007
You don't like an archaeologist he would collect the stuff

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Categorizing cocktail dresses

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
High heel shoes try and figure out who it came from why it was their baby bottles hair curlers toy rapper

131
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
Who did the Lakers photograph for year

132
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
Backpacks Bibles bottles

133
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Human arm

134
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
He finds an arm weigh between some rocks

135
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Like an entire arm up to the show

136
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Sticking sticking out between two rocks

137
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
There was no flashes other than the

138
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
The things are holding the joint together

139
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Yeah

140
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,711
Jason and his guidebooks you there with they began to search the surrounding areas for other parts of

141
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
The body let me really the goal is to try to find

142
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
The skull

143
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Because in terms of

144
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
You know

145
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Identification

146
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Your best luck is going to be if you can get if you can get

147
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
The

148
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Pieces of the skull

149
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,863
Because if you can find pieces of a skull maybe you can ID the body and if you can ID the body

150
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Maybe you can tell the family

151
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Here's what happened to your loved one

152
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
So we were out there basically digging around

153
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Four four other parts of this person

154
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
We come across a human tooth some little tiny bits of rib bones

155
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
But we never find the skull

156
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
But I realize that

157
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Nobody's ever going to identify the person

158
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
There's not enough left of them and

159
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Does not not likely to be a case that will be solved

160
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,303
Now Jason says he knew of course that people are dying in the desert

161
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
But to see this

162
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
The fragments of a person

163
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Erased

164
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
You know it's very

165
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
I mean it's kind of just it started to kill you

166
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
Eventually he began have these nightmares snakes coming out of the eyes

167
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:26,879
About the missing skull bird swooping down and then picking up the eyes coyotes playing soccer with a person skull

168
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
Couldn't shake the simple Quest

169
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
You know what

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
What did this to this person

171
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
And how many other bodies like this might be out here

172
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
How'd it get to be like this

173
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,519
Questions

174
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
End up sending Json down

175
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
Sort of rabbit hole digging in the library

176
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
Forensics papers

177
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:59,135
Missing persons report igartua gone missing historical trends

178
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,023
Sociology paper is demography paper government document illustrations and the figures in the bitter Berry gunny's appendices

179
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
And over the next several years Jason would end up putting together this

180
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
Truly startling portrait of lost stories hidden statistics

181
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
Little known policy decisions along our Southern border that completely upended how I think about this

182
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Issue issue

183
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Poses real problem

184
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
Challenges that were constantly fighting about

185
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Don't never quite

186
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
This part one of a three-part series

187
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
On our Southern border

188
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
Will be doing it today and then next week and the week after

189
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Part 1

190
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Hole in the fence

191
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
All right so I stopped and started off

192
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
With Json question

193
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
How'd it get to be like this

194
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
How did it get to be

195
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
That's so many

196
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,159
People cross into America through the desert like

197
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
That's the classic image you have is someone who

198
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Walking through the

199
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
The desert

200
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Why

201
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Out of all the places

202
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Along the border that

203
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
You could cross

204
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Why is it that

205
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,287
So many people are are crossing in the hottest and most unforgiving place

206
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Imaginable

207
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,943
One of the things that Jason ended up telling us about that we found

208
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Mosto

209
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Striking

210
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
With simply the numbers

211
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Yearly numbers

212
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Of Migrant deaths

213
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
What's in the desert

214
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
And I mean it is shocking if you look at the date of their

215
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
A very Stark moment when things ship

216
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
Is it turns out that

217
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
If you're looking at

218
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
The number of people dying

219
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
In the Sonoran Desert the numbers are a bit tough.

220
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Pain down butt in the early nineties

221
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
It's single digits five bodies one

222
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
On your six bodies another

223
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
7 bodies

224
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
All of a sudden

225
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Overnight in the late 90s

226
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
You go from 5 to 10 Bodies 2

227
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
200

228
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
I mean it used to be that if you wanted to cross the us-mexico border

229
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
You go down to

230
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Cassandis to Tijuana

231
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
At dusk

232
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
Please call the soccer field

233
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
You would hop the fence with about

234
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
100 other people in the witches

235
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Bum rush the border patrol in

236
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Pappy we get by

237
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Would make it into the US in

238
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,375
You'll have to get caught sent back and people do it again the next day

239
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
That was a system for a long time

240
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
I'm in love tell me what change

241
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Well

242
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
In the mid-90s there was a lot of push back up

243
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Against the visibility of

244
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Muffin topping

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
And

246
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
It all kind of starts

247
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
With

248
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
This little-known story

249
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
There's a great book by

250
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
This guy Timothy Dunn called

251
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Blockading the Border

252
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
And it's about the Latino high school students in Texas

253
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Is right on the

254
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
We ended up calling the author he mentioned Timothy done and it and I'm getting so interested in the story that done laid out for us that

255
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
We're going to leave Jason behind for a while

256
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
I'm going to go on a little

257
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Yes

258
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
That by the way is co reporter Tracy hunt

259
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
All right well so where we going to go

260
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
We're going to El Paso

261
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
El Paso Texas

262
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
So

263
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
Yes at Racine I went to El Paso a while back

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Tomorrow of course he thought that if I was born somewhere else yeah

265
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Of course I mean I think about that

266
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
I feel like

267
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,031
I guess I got distracted you didn't finish the American flag

268
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
And a Texan flag

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
We went down to El Paso to visit

270
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
High School

271
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
Call Bowie High School

272
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Did you guys understand

273
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,767
You know in many respects it's just you know your typical American High School

274
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:55,167
Yeah baby, do they get your taco Tuesdays it's nice to talk

275
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Afraid

276
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
About

277
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Coventry students

278
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
The detectorists know football

279
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
And on their campus to have a huge football stadium with those big ghetto Friday Night Lights

280
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Marching band The Pride of the south side

281
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
Yeah your typical Texas High School

282
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
Yeah but there is something a little different about it and that is that almost all the students here

283
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
Scared Jose or Mexican American

284
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Gisela

285
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Oscar and we actually talk to you one former teacher this is one cyber Coronado I was eight

286
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Teacher at Bowie High School in the 1980s and 1990s

287
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
And what did you think

288
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
I taught history and he said that in all his years teaching at Bowie out there for 21 years and never had a single analyst

289
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Really

290
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Single white

291
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,287
Did we went to Bowie High School it's cuz something happened there in the early 90s

292
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Something that

293
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,711
It's sort of a note in a roundabout and and totally unforeseen able way completely change the way we

294
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,575
Think about that the US Mexico border

295
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
So we're going to start the stories actually in one of one Seibert tornados class

296
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
The class was immediately after lunch

297
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
And on this particular day that we're going to have a debate in class

298
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
And one of them debaters

299
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
First one of the kids was

300
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Going to be part of the debate

301
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
With late yes

302
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
Albert alphin came to came late to class

303
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
And so we've been waiting and waiting and waiting for him

304
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
10 minutes went by

305
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
15

306
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
20 and eventually he showed up being dragged in by the scabs

307
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Security guy

308
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,231
The school security guard and I thought you the security guard and brought him in because he was you know

309
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,327
Out doing some miscreant stuff like smoking pot again and

310
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
And so I kind of lay into Albert for being late again and for you know that pulling up his wrist

311
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Responsibilities with glass

312
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,639
But but I was like no no no other says that he had been at the handball court playing with his friends

313
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
And then when it was time to go from the quarterbacks

314
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Class

315
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
These two border patrol agents just came out of nowhere and their green uniforms demanding to see his papers like who are you

316
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
Where you from let me see your ID and he Albert tries to give them his school ID but they wouldn't take it

317
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
And they actually told him do you need today

318
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Federal ID of some sort

319
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
For them to believe it all that he was a United States citizen

320
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Or belong on the camp

321
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
And one just standing there like haha border patrol really bringing the kid obviously

322
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,039
Virginia three or four other students in class just kind of stepped in and said know what Albert telling you is true

323
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
Not only is Albert telling the truth but in the last couple of weeks

324
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,487
Border patrol had been on the handball courts and on the playing field

325
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,839
Repeatedly stopping students harassing student and

326
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
I was quite frankly shocked

327
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
One says of course he knew that the Border Patrol was around

328
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,079
Because of where the school is situated which will

329
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Talk about in a second

330
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
But he just never understand

331
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Present they weren't his students live

332
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
I was having a hard time processing

333
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
So the next few weeks

334
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
One started asking around different students being like

335
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,023
Hey have you had anything happen with border patrol at school and I got literally hundreds

336
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,167
The stories I was walking home from school and then I have my backpack on

337
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
This is Nidia Rodriguez who was a freshman at the time and all the sudden I saw this truck

338
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Border patrol tracking

339
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
Eating my way a couple of Agents got out of the truck and started questioning her where am I where am I going

340
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
We're all rounded up remember is walking to

341
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
School with a bunch of kids

342
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:04,255
Her backpack and again you know a couple of Agents got outside questions or we were born

343
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
Birth classes were taking.

344
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
School what do you have in the bag

345
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
When I go books

346
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
You know what else would I have in my bag

347
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,663
Play like walking through yelled at me over here

348
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,991
Sped up to me in the stopped in front of him to ask me

349
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
You know what's what's in the bag of the books

350
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
One of them rip the bag out for my hands

351
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
As I was trying to pull it

352
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
Away from home the other one grabbed me and pushed me up against the truck

353
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Forcibly

354
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
The bag way

355
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Rifle through it

356
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
Push me out for the

357
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
I already pulled me away from the truck

358
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
I threw my bag at me and told me to get out of here

359
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
As the stories came out it became clear that even the staff had had its run-ins with the border patrol we talked to the

360
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Assistant football coach

361
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Ben morea

362
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
He told us there was this moment he was driving with

363
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
Two of his football players they got pulled over by the border patrol

364
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
And one of them actually pointed a gun at his

365
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
Had never had a gun

366
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Hold On Me

367
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511

I know I got a dinner fied myself my name is coach been with you coach Bowie High School I have two of my football players

I appreciate you shut your mouth and get out of the car did holster The Gun Ben did get out of the car

371
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Car everything was fine

372
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
What was that like

373
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Rainier

374
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
One of the scariest

375
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Things

376
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
In my life

377
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
Why was the Border Patrol

378
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
On the grounds of the

379
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
They have some reason what's a little bit more maybe because I seem to understand

380
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
What was going on at

381
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Bowie High School

382
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
You have to understand something else

383
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
The legend of El Paso

384
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
You have to understand

385
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
El Paso

386
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Flavor

387
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
From 30000 feet

388
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
Right on the border of Texas

389
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Mexico and New

390
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
It's also the biggest city

391
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
Shares a border with Mexico to the other thing to know about it is that it's like it kind of has a mirror City on the other side of them

392
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Which is

393
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Water

394
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Ciudad Juarez

395
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
The largest city on the US Mexico border

396
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
The two cities are separated by the

397
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,391
Little sliver of the Rio Grande but they were essentially the same city up until 1848 when the US

398
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Invaded Mexico in Annex half the country

399
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
And even now according to Juan this mythical division between these two cities it's just

400
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
Doesn't exist remote

401
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,287
I mean I go to the dentist over there I buy cigarettes over there okay I smoke it

402
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,615
Almost everybody El Paso knows people live in ciudad Juarez

403
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
People feel a lot of snow people in have family members who live in El Paso

404
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
And this is literally one community

405
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
But the thing is when everything was going down in Bowie in the early 90s it was a community

406
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
In crisis

407
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
The night shoot

408
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
The peso crisis has spilled across

409
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
The Rio Grande

410
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,191
In the eighties the Mexican peso

411
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,775
Trash

412
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
Until people in Juarez started flocking you a passo because

413
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Well that's

414
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,807
Swear the jobs work like Johnson Construction childcare gardening

415
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
Kermit.the coming to El Paso legally that then you had all these other people workers required by

416
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,095
Lock and get permits but they still need it to work simply respond to the laws of supply and demand

417
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,703
And so they started coming to across the border to the United States

418
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,567
At unprecedented numbers ten thousand people a day

419
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
A day

420
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
You legally basically for their commute to work

421
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
It was chaos

422
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
It was a mess here

423
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,135
Border patrol Agent Venom David Hamm as a special agent

424
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
He told us that when when he was on that job

425
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,328
Before Dawn you can go down a certain parts the Rio Grande you have a hundred two hundred people lined up

426
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
Waiting on the River's Edge sun come up in here they come

427
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
Rush hour has begun the rush across the Rio Grande into El Paso

428
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
And there videos where you can see that you you see people waiting into the shallow parts of the River to cross over to El Paso

429
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,344
If they don't want to get wet they can pay a young entrepreneurial small fee and raft across

430
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Is border patrol agent

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
It becomes this cat-and-mouse game probably the way we've always done business

432
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
They come in you chase him

433
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Catch him and send him back

434
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
Day and night and day and night it was it was

435
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
Never ending job

436
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,688
And it was something you know you catch the same guys to three times a shift sometimes

437
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Hello I'm sorry

438
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
It was it was chaos

439
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,112
Obviously we're not accomplishing 100% of our nation

440
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Eggs that you got a hilarious

441
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Salt Lake

442
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,280
Around this time in 1992 there was a television interview

443
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,096
And they'll misegades he's the secretary for the board of

444
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Paw Patrol in El Paso

445
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,728
He's wearing a green hat with his green uniform with the gold shield on his chest

446
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
If we were not here

447
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
Did not keep a lid on this situation

448
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
An in the shop

449
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Behind him salute free

450
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Import from other country

451
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
You can see people

452
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,648
Climbing up the banks of the Rio Grande and just walking into El Paso

453
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:58,048
Laughs like having Wyatt Earp standing in front of three bank robbers robbing a bank

454
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Like so

455
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
How many

456
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
Alright so it was reported

457
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,544
At a time that for everyone migrant the border patrol caught

458
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
There were at least three to five

459
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Who snuck in and didn't get caught

460
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,456
And The Weather Channel said that this was because they just didn't have the right

461
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Didn't have the money or the agents

462
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
To apprehend all these people that are coming in

463
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648
Which finally brings us back

464
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
To Bowie High School

465
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
Okay alright okay yeah let's try it

466
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Because there's two important things about

467
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Counting my steps

468
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
1

469
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Who is

470
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Right right or

471
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
5 6

472
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Right on the ball

473
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
49er basically it's 50-50 steps 50 steps from the

474
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,808
We can't fit into Mexico into

475
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
The former

476
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,416
Assistant football coach and teacher benemerito he showed me

477
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,744
What's the what is that

478
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Dispense

479
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328
The old manse

480
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,448
Put up a bunch of fencing on the border to curb

481
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
Illegal immigration

482
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
So it's like a

483
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,384
Did so much taller than us but it was it was pretty flimsy they called it to Tortilla curtain and

484
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
Right at this spot across from Bowie High School

485
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
There was a hole

486
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
In the fence

487
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Yeah

488
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
And David

489
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,208
Former border patrol agent told us what that meant was that you had mine heard you had a lot of migrants

490
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Could be

491
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,560
Coming through that hole in the fence for Bowie High School

492
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
And he claimed that it wasn't just people looking for work

493
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
It was also people bringing in drugs

494
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
No way I know that because I work

495
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
Anti-smuggling unit

496
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
Watch him come through

497
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
And so border patrol agents had taken

498
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,064
To just sort of hanging out around the school on the school's property on the football field across the

499
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
Street from the school like just they were just there all the time even rumors that border patrol

500
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
You just would go undercover as students

501
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
And that they would you no wonder the Halls that they would go into the locker rooms I've noticed the

502
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
The Suburban

503
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
Parked on the bully camp

504
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Again former Bowie teacher

505
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
1 Seibert Coronado the whole reason you know that I thought they were there was the chain link is cut and they need

506
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Stop people

507
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
From entering into a high school

508
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
Instead of realizing that what they're doing is they're using the high school as a hunting round

509
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
And so the one when he started hearing about all the stories of these 14 15 16 year old kids

510
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
Stockton shaken down

511
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,168
It wasn't about border patrol trying to stop migrants from coming in or trying to stop drugs from coming across the border

512
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,008
It was the border patrol simply stopping people because they were Brown

513
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,824
And that's really

514
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
His Radio

515
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Angered me

516
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,272
But for most of these kids

517
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
Look out of the ordinary

518
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
You know kids like Ernesto Munoz

519
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Ricardo vielma

520
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Day today

521
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:10,304
Life talkative into some of the committee members Tony Santos the told me don't worry about it

522
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,144
Core neighborhood right next to the Border real life

523
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
Hear it in South El Paso go to the park

524
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,336
Shoot some basketball

525
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,944
You tell your your schoolmates we going to guess what happened after school care

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
You know how you got stuff

527
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Because of your hair cutter probably cuz of

528
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
You know how you're dressed or whatever you're more likely to laugh about it then be angry but in his US history class that year

529
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,280
One started teaching his kids about civil rights

530
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Actually getting them to

531
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
The beat the different ways of thinking about

532
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Talking about stuff like

533
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Over the last

534
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Hugh Dane

535
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
Letter from Birmingham Jail on to my mine

536
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,248
Mark the non-violence movement coming of age

537
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,112
And Malcolm X's Ballot or The Bullet

538
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,744
Interview students are learning about

539
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Farm worker strikes in California 1960s we learn about Cesar Chavez

540
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,312
We learn about Dolores Huerta Vegas La Patilla Karina

541
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
He was like

542
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,896
Okay I'll bring that book and I look outside the window and

543
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
There they are

544
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Border patrol agents in SUV's

545
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
On the parking lot stopping student

546
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
I think that's funny that we were

547
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Wait

548
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Hannah would like

549
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
Not okay I mean I didn't fully know exactly the letter of the law.

550
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,680
Find you that's what they were doing was wrong to get together

551
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:57,056
But you think this is right what do you think this is about

552
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Potluck

553
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Are we wanted things to be different

554
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Let's see

555
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
What we can do about it

556
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Because this has to

557
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Alright that's what's up

558
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Coming up

559
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
Juan and his students buy back

560
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Will continue in just a moment

561
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Let's do some more warm up

562
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,848
Hi this is Monica calling from Oakland California

563
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,432

Www.slha.org

568
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

569
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
And I'm here because I need your help

570
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
And I request

571
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
For those of you who

572
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,984
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

573
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,824
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

574
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Tiny moments

575
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
Brilliant

576
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
Basically I want to hear about those times

577
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
When a kid you know did something

578
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
It just means you lean back and say

579
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Maybe it was the moment that I

580
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,208
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

581
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
Or maybe the kid was a piano

582
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,864
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

583
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Or maybe the kids in math class

584
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,728
Stay Ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

585
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
We're interested in the

586
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Epic moments where

587
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
A kid does something super smart

588
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
It doesn't have anything to do with it

589
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
If you have a story

590
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
T-shirt with

591
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
Go to radiolab.org

592
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Flash brilliance

593
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Mrecorder short

594
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Audio message

595
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Again that's radiolab.org

596
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Slash brilliant

597
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Thank you so much

598
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,080
Chad Robert and hello

599
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Ricardo

600
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
And Tony

601
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
Okay alright so some of these kids at Bowie High School they actually belong to this group

602
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,648
Which is a Chicano civil rights

603
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
This has been around for holidays

604
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
Cintas 1960s it was a college group that these kids at Bowie actually petition them to have a chapter at

605
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
And I said sure

606
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,544
We were the first ones to get the Collegiate group

607
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
Supervised we would meet about once a week

608
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
And

609
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
Our meetings tended to be 30 40 50 kids

610
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Packed into a classroom

611
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,344
And for one of these meetings one brought in one of his friends a woman named Susan Curran

612
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
She works for the Border rights

613
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Coalition and social

614
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,744
She comes in and he student start telling her you know what's been going on

615
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
And they asked her if we have any rights here

616
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
She tells them absolutely you do because according to

617
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
The US Constitution

618
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
The border patrol or really

619
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Any officer of the law they cannot

620
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
Stop you

621
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Without reasonable cause

622
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
Beyhadh 15 you cross the border or when you saw them he started acting fidgety or you ran away or some

623
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:55,136
They can't just arbitrarily stop you question you because of the color of your

624
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
That's not enough to stop you

625
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,792
Because if that's the only reason they have to stop you then they're violating your fourth

626
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:05,632
Right the right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures

627
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Exactly

628
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
They just said you know what

629
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,264
You're getting your rights are getting stomped all over let's see

630
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
What we can do about this because it needs to stay

631
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
After Susan explain that the rights were being violated the conversation turned to what are we going to do about it

632
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
We have a lot of students who were suggesting things

633
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,392
That were probably you know slightly inappropriate

634
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,488
Like how about we just curse him out which I thought will make us out a bad approach

635
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
But apparently

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
According to one's friend Susan

637
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
Better to salt and so away from them

638
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
Definitely don't do that

639
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
But

640
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Finally

641
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
One of the students

642
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,368
Who's been watching Law & Order attempted murder of your mother

643
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
Who's knew all about

644
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:05,280
Saying the right to remain silent

645
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,120
You would like nothing it's your 5th amendment constitutional right

646
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,728
Isn't that you typically hear or instructed by my counsel

647
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Not to test

648
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
The five based on my fifth amendment constitutional rights

649
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
When rich white dudes get into

650
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Advice of counsel I broke my 5th Amendment privilege

651
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
And respectfully

652
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Decline to answer your question

653
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
But this one Bui match a student would like

654
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
Why don't we do that

655
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,232
And that's exactly what our students started doing

656
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,632
After that when border patrol agents would stop students and say hey give me your papers

657
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Some of these students would say

658
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
No I want to use my Fifth Amendment right I want to take the Fifth Amendment

659
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Simple as that they have the right not to incriminate myself

660
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Tremaine Style

661
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,712
I do not want to answer your question

662
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:01,856
Start Heidelberg right to remain silent

663
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,256
I don't want you to go through any of my stuff backpack

664
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,584
Amendment Amendment right

665
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,912
Spreading around right to remain silent

666
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
That we really

667
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Dump near me

668
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
The answer people's questions

669
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
The reminder

670
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Why why why

671
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Myself being

672
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
Being you and giving advice to these

673
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,488
Students and on the one hand obviously this is their legal right not to

674
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Provide

675
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
Information on the other hand

676
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
I can imagine that you know I've heard that there are

677
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
Border patrol abuse has there are

678
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
You know this

679
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
There are times when it doesn't go well and I'm telling you student

680
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
To go out

681
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
And basically

682
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
Be home

683
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
Stonewall

684
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Agency

685
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
It could put them In Harm's Way

686
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
And it did free

687
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Students were harassed for this

688
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Students were

689
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,840
The most notorious case is the case of David Renteria

690
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,496
And the way I started was on June 3rd

691
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
What was made in the 90s

692
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Is about Bowie High School

693
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
Yes sir David Renteria he was a senior at Bowie legally blind students coming home from graduation

694
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Practice and

695
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,600
And it's one day he just ran or just walking down the street and a border patrol truck

696
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,696
Rosa

697
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,280
My friend is the same thing in the office again what is a citizen

698
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,376
Seances again

699
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Stand up

700
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:10,624
Out of the truck comes up to David break his arm if you tried to walk away

701
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
On my own

702
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Slept album

703
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
You turned it

704
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
Exercising

705
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Stance

706
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,592
And I he put his neck on the back of my neck

707
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
A kick my legs

708
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
Laughing at his face apparently

709
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
And you know David wasn't

710
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,552
Physically injured after that he was freaked out

711
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
The recent one called

712
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,672
Particular incident notorious is because

713
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Immediately after

714
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,144
The local news in El Paso picked it up and started doing a lot more reporting on

715
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
On Border Patrol

716
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Andouille

717
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,288
And so did

718
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
National news

719
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,432
Good morning freaking America you know what I mean that's that's that's pretty huge

720
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
Explain the relationship between the Border Patrol

721
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,856
And some people at Bowie High School

722
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
And that alright

723
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
Daily on a day-to-day course are being violated

724
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Wyoming wrestling

725
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Because we're Hispanic

726
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Because the color of our skin

727
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
Because we live right on the border and because

728
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Well we live in a really poor neighborhood end

729
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
That's the only reason

730
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Atavist new started

731
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,032
Grow the border patrol sector Chief Dale musegades

732
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
Decided he was going to come to Bowie

733
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
To talk to the students

734
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,712
Is that something you remember him showing up

735
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,624
Doing damage control at that point

736
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
Discuss the alleged harassment he kept us out

737
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
We tried to contact you on musically.

738
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Multiple timezone

739
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
The story but he did not reply to her voicemail

740
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
But

741
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Wednesday morning

742
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
We were able to get footage

743
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Which of that meeting Mousa Gates

744
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:08,128
Kept Good Morning America out because one of the students take this

745
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
And then we need to get our hands on it

746
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,760
So it's like 30-40 kids from matcha in this classroom

747
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
And Dale misegades

748
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
He was sitting in front of us

749
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,160
Wearing a suit and tie trying to put things into perspective

750
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
Started telling the students like

751
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Look the holes in the fence

752
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
I can't hold it hold

753
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:30,144
We keep patching them up they keep getting cut open

754
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
I can't I

755
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
I don't think there's any way in the world

756
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:41,664
And he told the students say they busted some people who had brought drugs through Bowie

757
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
Investigation

758
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,832
So music is this like we're essentially trying to stop the flow of drugs here why are you guys complaining so

759
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
But eventually

760
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
Decedent start speaking up

761
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:10,080
One student stands up and says hey you're harassing us and that's why we're upset

762
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
And be your strategy for capturing border-crossers seems to be to heard them all into the school where they're penned in

763
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
Relevant to a place where they can get out of the you circled in it

764
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
It's raining like cat people

765
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:32,096
Will not stop

766
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
I don't like

767
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,472
You know I don't know a better way to do it but not at the sacrifice of a right

768
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
It's a little hard to hear but he said not at the sacrifice of our rights

769
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,344
I do not have right

770
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
What did it feel like to be sitting in that meeting I mean

771
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
It felt bizarre I mean that you know somebody is denying what everybody sees with her own eyes

772
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
There was no face value to what what he said now cuz it that when we were standing cynical about the whole situation and

773
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
And are you trying to undo the stuff that was already

774
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
To the meeting goes poorly

775
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,968
And a bunch of the students and some of the staff including benemerito this is

776
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Football coach who had a gun

777
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,600
They all together decide that they want to

778
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Sue the Border Patrol

779
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
The phone rings one day

780
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
And eventually they call up this guy

781
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,560
If we're getting ready to sue the Border Patrol

782
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Will you be our local Council

783
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,656
And I said no but hell yeah

784
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,472
El Paso civil rights lawyer

785
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,824
Albert armendariz jr. optimistic

786
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,480
It's never nice job during the government is not easy when you live on the border and working Segundo Barrio

787
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,528
You are never optimistic

788
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
Then a governmental system is going to work for you

789
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
So

790
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,304
October 23rd 1992 the trial between Bowie High School and the border patrol begin

791
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
And apparently the courtroom was

792
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,448
Pretty much divided in half on one half you had the border patrol like

793
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
Agents in full uniform sitting there

794
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
Another half you had these boots

795
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
Dressed in their finest

796
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
Mini dresses black

797
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,456
Those kids were little Troopers

798
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
They all done up in the stand

799
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
Told her story

800
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
And then eventually

801
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Border patrol sector Chief still missing

802
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
Do you remember what the defense's argument was

803
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Well they had lots of argue

804
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Now we can't verify this

805
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,936
Specifics of what happened in the courtroom because a lot of the court documents of being destroyed

806
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,264
Music it's got off there and his basic argument was it

807
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
If you look at

808
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
The US code

809
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Federal regulations

810
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
1357

811
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
Powers of immigration officers and employees

812
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Number one

813
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Officers

814
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
Have the power to interrogate

815
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,391
Any alien or person believed to be an alien

816
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,719
As to his right to be or to remain in the United States

817
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
And I can do that without a warrant

818
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
And then

819
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,727
They can do that quote within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States

820
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
What's a what's a reasonable distance

821
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,335
So this is what nuts has I I don't know exactly what

822
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,663
Went into the germination of what that is but the distance is

823
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
A hundred miles

824
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
Really yeah in that hundred mile Zone border patrol has the power to interrogate has the power to arrest without warrant

825
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
And they can also and I'm quoting here

826
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
Quote search for aliens in any Railway car aircraft conveyance or vehicle within that

827
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
And then on top of that within a narrow word

828
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
Distance of 25 miles

829
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Miles from the border

830
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,727
They can go right under private property

831
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Whenever they want

832
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
There's the zone

833
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
It's designed

834
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
To prevent

835
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,663
Border patrol officers for being charged with

836
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
With trespass

837
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
When patrolling the Border

838
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Akai cross-examined

839
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Music

840
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
And so

841
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,159
What music it was arguing is it like if they have all this power

842
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:12,511
And if they can go on private property right up on the border

843
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
And you got this High School On the Border

844
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:20,959
Then there's no question that they can be on school property and do their jobs that's how they read that

845
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
But they couldn't understand is

846
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
They were

847
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:29,663
Doing it in a way that violated the Constitution and that is against the supreme law of the land

848
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
This was Albert's argument that

849
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
No matter what towers you have you can't violate somebody's Fourth Amendment right

850
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
You have to have a

851
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Gintama treason

852
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
To stop somebody

853
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
So what did the court ultimately happened before this court is finding us that says findings of fat

854
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,071
Facts and conclusions of law

855
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Bunton

856
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
, senior District

857
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Judge

858
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:56,031
Before this court is plaintiff motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction and memorandum of Law and support

859
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Pursuant to rule Seattle

860
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Does that sound

861
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:05,503
What we got in front of me here

862
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Jurisdiction and venue

863
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
Okay that means

864
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,975
Keep me the findings of fact the litigation the name individual plaintiffs are united

865
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Is it. I hereby order

866
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,959
The court hereby enjoying the immigration and National Naturalization Service the ins

867
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
It's about the time with both of them

868
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,615
From stopping and questioning an individual as to

869
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
His or her right

870
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,199
To be or remain in the United States

871
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,783
Unless the agent has Reasonable Suspicion based on speed

872
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Specific articulable facts

873
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,439
Involving more than the mere appearance of the individual being a Hispanic

874
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Descent

875
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,535
Okay that's a fancy way of saying stop judging people by their looks

876
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Side the judge

877
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Yes

878
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
So they wanted they want

879
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
It was just

880
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Absolutely

881
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,847
Like she was a big celebratory school assembly

882
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
They're all

883
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
Hardee's

884
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,247
Plaques I think I might even have some of the wall up there

885
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:15,647
It was pretty awesome again for my student Ricardo vielma

886
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,231
Holds that the border patrol did violate constitutional rights

887
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,303
You just don't see the agents on our campus anymore

888
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,911
Deputy assistant football coach been Maria who ended up being a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit

889
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Treating us like people like second-class citizens

890
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Federal agent

891
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
And we couldn't believe that we took on the federal government and one

892
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
That was one of the first times I was really proud of what our government

893
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,783
DL stands for

894
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Ricardo said

895
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,423
Coming out of federal court that day

896
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
It was like him and seven other students

897
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Send it came out

898
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
And there's a bunch of other students and faculty from the school there everybody was like cool let's go back to school hop in the car like now

899
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
Yeah we kind of want a basket

900
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
So we walked from

901
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,063
The federal courthouse downtown to Bowie High School

902
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
And you know when we were getting there where

903
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
