1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
Robert krulwich

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,832
This is Radiolab about the

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,928
The crazy Power of Words in particular 60 words

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Is

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
It has

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
You can say defined America for the last 12 years

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
And

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
In a place to start

13
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Is it difficult

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,704
This just saying you were looking at

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
Obviously a very

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
Disturbing life

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
September 11th 2001 8:46 a.m.

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,944
Has crashed into the World Trade Center we don't know anything more than that we don't

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,272
This is the day that anyone who is old enough to remember desert

20
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
Remember where we were

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
Who we were with

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,048
And

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Course

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
We can remember how we felt

25
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
It is the worst attack ever on American soil

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
But

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
If you really want understand the world we live in now

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
You got a jump ahead one day to September 12th to a corner office in the white house where there's a lawyer sitting

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Computer try to figure out how are we going to declare war

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
And one of the things that everybody realizes after sort of an initial discussion is yes we'd like to do

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Declare war but we have no idea upon whom we should declare war that is Gregory Johnson the Michael Hastings now

32
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
National Security reporting fellow at BuzzFeed the reason this lawyer by the name of Timothy flan

33
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
The reason Flanagan is sitting at a computer in an office is because been President George Bush had to do something he had to

34
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
You didn't want to act alone you wanted Congressional approval right I mean technically in an emergency

35
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Can defend the country is the commander-in-chief after all he doesn't have to go to Congress and say hey do I have author

36
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Relation to use for an emergency that's been with us by the way senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Magician but President Bush needed Congress on his side he felt it was important that we Project Unity

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
We're all standing together as one and second if this was an act of war the power to declare war in the car

39
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,608
Constitution is given to Congress not the executive when Congress declares war

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
Suddenly the president has a very clear and

41
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Powerful mandate

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Now the declaration of war is kind of a dead instrument of international law II mean nobody's declared war

43
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Since World War II

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,504
But the modern incarnation of the declaration of war

45
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Is

46
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
The authorization to use for

47
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
The authorization to use

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Force What's called the authorization for the use of military force for as it's commonly refer to the AU

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
NF

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Right so

51
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Are lawyer in the White House

52
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Flanagan

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
He's given a task

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Go right in aumf to Congress contended

55
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
He really has no idea so he goes back to the last time

56
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
That the US did this

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
Last time Congress passed one of these things he does it quick

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Sort of search on his computer

59
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Find it 1991 Iraq

60
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
The Gulf War

61
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Flanigan grabs attack

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
And then he copies that into a Word document

63
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
And that becomes his template he make some Cuts he makes

64
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Some changes he delete some word men

65
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
He hit send

66
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
Are war on Terra adjustable

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Reset emotions bewildering series of events are us drone strike in linked to Al-Qaeda

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,528
Madness that is basically the world we live in

69
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,856
15 members of a wedding reception who killed wife

70
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
If you like me even sadistic treatment feel like me and you find yourself flipping through the channels see the news

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
Ignoring it then every so often thinking

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
Terrorism Targets in Africa from Libya now the u.s. Air Force drone strike in southern Somalia

73
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
How are we doing this in all these different places

74
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
100 prisoners are on a hunger strike

75
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,247
Thank you for so long is it okay to do that

76
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Witches who signed off on this you know

77
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
And it turns out

78
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
We all did because it was in that document

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:50,047
This is the legal foundation for everything that the US has done everything from Guantanamo Bay

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
Two drone strikes to secret rendition

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
To seal rate it's all been hung off the 60 words

82
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
And that's the crazy

83
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Buy the body of the stock

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
The part that really matters

85
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
And the reason that when I was reading Gregory's reporting on this house

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Like what

87
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Is it it all goes back

88
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
2 1

89
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Single sentence

90
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
60 words one cent

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Can you read it

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Absolutely

93
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,975
That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate Force

94
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Against those Nations

95
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Organization

96
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Or person

He determines planned

98
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Authorized

99
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Committed

100
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Or aided the terrorist attacks

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
That occurred on September 11th

102
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
2001

103
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Or Harbor

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Such organizations

105
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Or person

106
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
In order to prevent

107
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
Any future ask

108
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Of international terrorism

109
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Against the United States

110
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
By such Nations

111
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Organization

112
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Or persons

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
60 words

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
Today a collaboration with BuzzFeed Adam with reporter Gregory johnsen

115
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
We're going to try to

116
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Code those words

117
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
And ask where do those words

118
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
And how

119
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
Did they come to mean what they mean

120
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
It's not what you think

121
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
And how did they end up

122
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
Leading us into what is arguably the longest war in American history

123
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,575
And nobody saw it coming actually no but that's the weirdest part

124
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Nobody - 1

125
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Let's start

126
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
Linda Vista Barbara Lee

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,375
Write Berkeley is a congresswoman from right around Berkeley

128
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
California

129
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Hello hello hello hi it's Barbara

130
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,359
And she is someone who has been in many ways a lifelong Act

131
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Going all the way back to when she was 15 and High School

132
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
San Fernando Valley

133
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Cuz I wanted to be a cheerleader

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
But you know since the early 60s

135
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Have certain criteria like

136
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
At least weather was stated or not

137
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Blond and blue eyes

138
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,327
For you I would figure and I was really hard so I went to the n-double-acp

139
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
She got them to pressure the

140
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
The school to change the rules

141
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
And she became the first black cheerleader

142
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm at at her High School yeah yeah that's just my way of introduction fast forward many years to become a congresswoman

143
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Gets elected to a second term

144
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
And on that day

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
There is smoke pouring out of the Pentagon she was at the capital no one knew where to go so the police officers just said run

146
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
Run run go go go attacking our country so I ran out of the capital of Pennsylvania

147
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
The Avenue

148
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
I remember looking back

149
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
It's a lot of smoke

150
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Which was you know the Pentagon so clearly

151
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
The country is under attack clearly

152
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
People have died clearly

153
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
We've got a deal with whoever did this

154
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Whatever it takes

155
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,943
Fast forward 2 days September 13th barbely's back of the capitol

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
To meet with

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
Her Democratic colleagues to review that document

158
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
The Flanagan Center

159
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
The mood in the room was very somber and very angry

160
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
Other thing we have to keep in mind when we're talking about this

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
Is all of this was done within 72 hours

162
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
After the worst terrorist

163
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Attack

164
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
In United States history

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
And very

166
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Confused

167
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
What would be the appropriate response

168
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
So is she and her colleagues read those 60 were

169
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
There was a lot of debate going on back and forth oh yeah

170
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Oh yes from everyone

171
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Because it's actually wasn't the first rap

172
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Flanagan had sent one over the night

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,903
Before September 12th 2001 and that one was something that almost no one agreed

174
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
According to Gregory that early draft

175
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Had a few extra lines in it

176
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
One gave the

177
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
The president

178
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
The power

179
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
To preempt

180
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
Any future acts of aggression against the United

181
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
Barbara Lee and her colleagues knew that look

182
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
So many things can be packed into this word

183
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Aggression

184
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
That if we sign on today

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
That if we give the president

186
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Does power

187
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
The president may never have to come back to Congress ever again

188
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
And request authorization for military force

189
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
Because he can say that anything is aggression

190
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
And we're also giving him the power to preamp

191
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
To the kicked back to the White House Flanagan took out those

192
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
And now they have this new draft

193
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
That the president

194
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
Is authorized to use all net

195
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Siri inappropriate

196
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Just what you heard

197
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
It's the one Barbara read that

198
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Hats off racist

199
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Glycol necessary

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
What does that even mean

201
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
I said this is too broad let's not

202
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,807
Definitive is open-ended and I she was speaking this is taking place in the basement of the Capitol building

203
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
She sees some of her Democratic colleagues start to nod

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
People we're not in people were not

205
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Is everybody there knew the danger

206
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
You just have to go back 50 years

207
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
The Gulf of Tonkin

208
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Gulf of Tonkin

209
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Tonkin

210
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Yes

211
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
To explain

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
My fellow American

213
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
At present

214
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Commander in Chief

215
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
1964 LBJ announces that to American ships

216
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,415
Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam were torpedoed by North Vietnamese boat people now

217
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Now argue that one of these attacks never even happened

218
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Nonetheless President Johnson won

219
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Strike Back

220
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
So yes Congress

221
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
To pass a resolution

222
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Which they did

223
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Giving the power to quote

224
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Take all necessary measures

225
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
To repel any armed attack

226
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Against the forces of the United States

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Inter prevent

228
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Further aggression

229
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Making it clear

230
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
That our government

231
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Answer United

232
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
And its determination

233
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
To take all necessary measures

234
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Import of freedom

235
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
10 in defense of Peace in Southeast Asia

236
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Now it is the broad language of that.

237
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Most people believe

238
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
It opened the door to the worst

239
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Part of the Vietnam War

240
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
The Rangers and Marines took casualties mostly from Hitman sniper the thousands

241
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
Thousands of casualties atrocities

242
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,295
567 South Vietnamese civilians in March 1968

243
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,671
And in a television interview in 1969 when President Johnson was as to justify at all

244
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:16,095
I can't just blame him in August 1964

245
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
The new whatever maybe next

246
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,639
To the lessons of Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam that was very much in the air

247
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
In that meeting on

248
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
September 13th

249
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
2001 several key leaders hope to avoid a repeat of the 1964 Tonkin Gulf resolution so is understanding

250
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Barbara Lee stood up

251
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
Passage where colleagues she was worried about some of the slang

252
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
People are not a people were not

253
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,071
So there was a lot of uncertainty about what to do but

254
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
In the end those concerns were ultimately outweighed

255
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Buy another

256
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
We've got to be unified with the present we can't show political division

257
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Let's have the nation let's have Congress

258
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Speaking with one voice

259
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
It was a time for Unity and borax

260
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
It's a walking out of that Democratic caucus

261
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
On the evening of September 13th Congressional leadership decided

262
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
The D60 words

263
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
This is the version there's no going back to the drawing board

264
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
And so

265
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
At 10:16 a.m. September 14th 2001

266
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Session clerk will call the roll

267
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Dashiell calls about

268
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Mr. Alan's

269
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Mr. Alan's

270
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
There 98 Senators on the floor

271
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Mister morning itch

272
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
All 98 event vote yay

273
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,015
So is asleep later in the day of the resolution we go to the house

274
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Where Barbara Lee was

275
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
A representative

276
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Dashiell XU Rush the vote

277
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,487
Do the Senate because the White House is called for a National Prayer meeting at the National Cathedral

278
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
For the victims of

279
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
That's supposed to start right at noon

280
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
And so right after the vote all the Senators

281
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,959
Pour out of the capital and get onto the buses I'm trying to get through the drizzle

282
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
There's actually raining that day

283
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Know that moment

284
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Barbara Lee

285
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,151
She hadn't decided how it is that she was going to vote I struggled with it for the previous two nights

286
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Denver 12th and 13th

287
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
She stayed up late calling back to advisors

288
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
Friends in California we talk

289
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Everyday

290
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Including this guy this is Ron dellums

291
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,255
Alright serve for 27 years in the US House of Representatives Barber used to be his chief

292
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Staff and when he resigned

293
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
She want his

294
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Congressional seat you know she would say what what about this in

295
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
What do you think about that and we kind of talked through the

296
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
The emotional state of the country that we are feeling

297
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Pain

298
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Anger

299
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
We're shocked

300
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
Both Barbara and Ron were trained as psychiatric

301
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Social worker

302
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
So they both knew

303
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
It when a person is feeling all of those things

304
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
Generally better to do nothing

305
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
Yes I called you one-on-one you don't

306
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
Make decisions when your morning

307
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Afraid

308
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
On the other hand

309
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
I believe you know and unity to

310
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
I want to be unified with the president when the country is under attack

311
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,471
I understood he didn't tell me he didn't say which way I should vote but I did say two

312
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Barber however you vote

313
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
I will always respect

314
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
You will always be friend

315
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
You will always be family

316
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
So that moment

317
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
With the memorial service about the

318
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
To start in a few hours to the houseboat

319
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,159
Barbara Lee was at the capital I was in the cloakroom and said she wasn't sure how she was going to vote she plan to skip the memorial

320
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
She wanted to stay she wanted to think and then

321
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
I don't know what it was

322
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,191
May have been the spirit moving me I don't know but at the very last minute she was drinking actually can of ginger ale at the

323
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
I think I'm going to go and I just ran out I probably was the last one on the bus I had the can of ginger ale in my hand and

324
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Ran down the steps and got on the bus

325
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
She got to the cathedral the house buses arrived about

326
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
30 minutes or so before the opening

327
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
And so far for 30 minutes she's in the

328
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
Cathedral about halfway back listening to the Oregon

329
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Thinking about

330
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
The families in those who were

331
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,447
There are people around her who are sort of whispering the pain and anguish

332
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
A few people who are crying

333
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
I said I got to pray over this

334
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,383
And she just wrestling with her boat

335
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,063
Her heart is say one thing this is too broad and her head is Saint Unity

336
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
How is it that you can be against the president

337
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Does point

338
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,023
Speaking of the president eventually President Bush

339
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Take the podium we are here in the

340
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Middle hour of our grief

341
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Just three days removed from these events

342
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Americans

343
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Do not yet have

344
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
The distance of History

345
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
But our responsibility to history

346
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Is already clear

347
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
To answer these attacks

348
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
And rid the world of evil

349
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
And then as soon as President Bush

350
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Steps down

351
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Everyone in the congregation

352
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
Stands up and they they sing The Battle Hymn

353
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Republic

354
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,591
Which is a very powerful

355
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
A very moving

356
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Piece of music

357
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,807
But it's not the sort of thing that is typically sung at a memorial service since it's a very

358
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,415
Forward and almost aggressive sounding was the phrase terrible Swift

359
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Sword

360
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Yeah

361
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Oh my God

362
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
It was

363
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Not quite

364
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
What I expected in a memorial service

365
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
But

366
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
The second speaker

367
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
A reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter

368
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Got up

369
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
He gave a reading from Jeremiah 31

370
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
Israel suffered

371
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
The excruciating pain on

372
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Tragedy of militant aggression

373
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,871
And destruction here in that all over again takes me right back there and I remember

374
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Korean drama

375
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,967
Lamenting and bitter weeping weeping

376
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Rachel weeping for her children

377
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Weeping

378
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
For her children

379
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
When he spoke

380
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
That's when two men

381
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
What is the Memorial

382
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
And then

383
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
He

384
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
He started

385
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,303
Pray for healing for grief-stricken hot

386
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,911
For the souls and sacred memory of those

387
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Who have been love

388
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
And

389
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
He said something that really struck

390
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,127
Barbara Lee Divine wisdom

391
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,199
He said as we Act

392
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
We not become

393
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Be evil

394
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
We deplore

395
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
That evil that we deplore

396
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
When he said that

397
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,607
Became very it was the sense of peace and calm came over me

398
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:18,239
And Barbara Lee says it was right then that you knew what you do

399
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
The clerk report the title house joint resolution 64 joint resolution to authorize the use

400

Later that evening the house opens up at

402
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Bait on the aumf

403
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Speaker

00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:36,415
Arise in support of this resolution which authorizes the president to use all Force necessary

405
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,511

00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Horizon supported this resolution tonight to fully endorse and authorise

407
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
The use of force

408
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
One after another

409
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
The doctor arrives in support of the authorization

410
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
16 in a row

411
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,991
Until Jalan from California is recognized for a minute and a half

412
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
We get to Barbara Lee

413
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,623
Mr. speaker members arrived today really with a very heavy heart

414
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,767
When did is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week

415
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,423
Only the most foolish and the most cows without understand the grief

416
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Are people and millions across the world

417
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
The I am agonized over this vote

418
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
Grips with it today

419
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
And I came to grips with opposing this resolution

420
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,879
During the very painful very beautiful memorial service

421
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
As a member of the clergy spoke eloquently said as we

422
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
The ACT let us not become the evil that we do

423
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Deplore

424
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Just after the boat Barbara Lee says she was

425
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
The cloakroom again

426
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,759
And she starts getting accosted by colleagues all of these friends are coming up to her and saying

427
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
You've got to go back you you cannot vote

428
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,647
Changing my boat one of them actually said

429
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,999
It hurt look you've done so much on HIV you've done so much on Aid

430
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
This boat is going to take you out

431
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Think of the bigger picture

432
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Are you saying you're dead

433
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,287
Giving president the authority to go to war we don't know what we're doing and you know the only Congress can declare war

434
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,871
Help me on this guy's the houseboat

435
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Okay I was just now finished

436
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
That boat

437
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
And we see one

438
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
Novo during the final vote for the house was

439
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
422

440
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
We know what the Democrat we don't

441
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
Yet know who will figure that out

442
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
Barbara Lee was the only person

443
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
In the Senate

444
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
For the house

445
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Cast a no vote

446
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,639
That must have been a very lonely moment to be perfectly honest with you I said some prayers

447
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
For my friend

448
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
This was the right thing to do

449
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
And you know votes like this

450
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,184
You have to be ready to pay the consequences over the next few weeks and months

451
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
Her office was inundated

452
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Ladders

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
Barbara Lee your traitor and a disgrace to the office that you hold archive to Mills College

454
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
Weight on American society terrorist yourself

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
So much hatred

456
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,872
I don't know why you decided to place yourself into the camp of terrorist attacks came and they came and they came

457
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,040
Death run off to hell with you and Benedict Arnold one of these security day and night

458
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,880
Thanks for supporting the Taliban hey henway Barbara Lee

459
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
What are you

460
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
What do you believe in you go to Mills College in Oakland

461
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
What are there you will find 60000 letter

462
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
They're not all things

463
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
But most are

464
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
The congressman Lee says she never faltered

465
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Because right after the boat

466
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
She's in her office my dad called me

467
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Lieutenant Colonel retired in the army

468
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,664
He said I'm really proud of you you know my daddy been in Korea

469
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
And World War II

470
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
You see the way I see it

471
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,856
Cuz I really wasn't sure what he was saying cuz you know

472
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
I really wasn't sure

473
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
Chabad alright Daddy's proud of me

474
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,304
Now we should know that Barbara Lee is still a congresswoman

475
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
She did not pay the price

476
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
For that no vote

477
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,936
Whatever you think of of her VOC weather youth

478
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
I think it was the right thing to do with wrong thing to do what is interesting to me

479
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Is that

480
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,152
As we're sitting here looking back on 12 years of war she was sitting there 12 years ago looking forward

481
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
And maybe she saw something about how this

482
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Play out

483
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
But how these

484
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
These words say 60 words

485
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Would start to grow

486
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
And expand

487
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
What's next

488
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,144

And I'm here because I need your help

493
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
And I request

494
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

495
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

496
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,288
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

497
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,616
It just means you bring back and say whoa

498
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
Maybe it was the moment that I

499
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,504
I kid you been reading to 4 month started reading back

500
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Do you

501
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

502
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,928
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

503
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,792
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

504
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
We're interested in the

505
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Epic moments where

506
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,728
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

507
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008

Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich should Radiolab in today 60 words

515
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Is a collaboration with

516
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
BuzzFeed and

517
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Reporter Gregory johnsen

518
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Stories based

519
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
On a

520
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
An article that Gregory Road

521
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
About this

522
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
60

523
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Simple word

524
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
It really defined American counter-terrorism

525
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
More than a decade

526
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,600
It's called the authorization for use of military force

527
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
That shorten to aumf and was passed by Congress

528
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
3 days after

529
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
September 11th

530
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
Here it is again read by Senator John

531
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,168
It says the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate Force against those Nations organization

532
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,544
Are persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks

533
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,664
That occurred on September 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons

534
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,528
In order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States

535
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:31,392
By such nations are organizations

536
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
He seems almost boards saying

537
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Yeah he does

538
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
Can I just be honest with you for a second

539
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
I generally move to the world

540
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
With the

541
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Assumption

542
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
Has been proven over and over again.

543
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
A truth that I don't know how the world

544
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Like somehow I missed that day in school or something are you referring something in specific like a general sense

545
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
It somehow like Oz is out there behind the curtain pulling levers and I'm just

546
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Always got me stuck on this

547
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
You know what motivates the show for me

548
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
I feel kind of stupid most

549
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
And these shows are a way to engage

550
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Examine the word

551
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Night

552
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
And when it comes to these matters of national

553
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
I really feel

554
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Clueless

555
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
Until when I read Gregory's article

556
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
I felt like I understood something crucial

557
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
For the first time

558
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
By the way words actually operates in the world

559
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
Cuz like again this sentence this totally boring sentence this is the legal foundation for everything that the US has done

560
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes

561
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
The secret Renditions

562
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,584
To seal rates it's all been hung off the 60 words one lawyer who is in the Bush Administration said look

563
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
This sentence is like a Christmas tree

564
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
All sorts of things have been hung off of

565
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
But how

566
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Hotlix

567
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Cuz you don't you read the thing and you don't

568
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
Seeing any mention of

569
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Guantanamo Bay in those

570
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
60 words

571
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Doesn't mention detention

572
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
It doesn't mention

573
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,064
Drone strikes it doesn't mention

574
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Drone strikes

575
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Against American citizen

576
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
That guy

577
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Some of the first books

578
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Recalled to help

579
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
What's the code this that's

580
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,816
That's John Bellinger I served as the legal advisor for the Nationals

581
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,936
Security Council from 2001 to 2005 and as the legal advisor for

582
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
The Department of State

583
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
2005 to 2009

584
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,848
You can't do any speed dating with an E with a credential like that cuz

585
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,944
The date will be over that's my congressional testimony voice

586
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,320
Attention isn't anywhere in the sockets how do you read detention from the sick

587
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
The argument with which I am

588
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Purple as a legal matter

589
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Is this he says if you go eight words into those 60 words and you get to the phrase all necessary and appropriate

590
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Appropriate Force

591
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Cesarean

592
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
Does resolve what is force

593
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
What does that mean

594
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,080
What are you out if I punch you in the face that's amusing for it that's one kind of morning use forced

595
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,688
To kill people but a lesser use of force is to detain them

596
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Detention is simply lesser in

597
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Excluded

598
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
IND use-of-force

599
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
It comes naturally in a military operation

600
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
It's like a subset

601
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,560
So if you're authorized to use Force to kill people you are also by default authorized to use Force

602
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
To detain them

603
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,192
I sent sheet to knock them out of the battle in other ways than that that forces both

604
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Necessary

605
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
And it's

606
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
And the courts have upheld that

607
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
That one Workforce

608
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
That is how you justifying

609
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
Guantanamo Bay controversy surrounding Guantanamo Bay

610
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Continue

611
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
The authorization to use military force act has

612
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:48,000
I've been the legal basis for the Detention of thousands of individuals

613
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,352
Numb about being charged words detention or never mentioned

614
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,216
Because that's attention if it gets even trickier if you go just a few words

615
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Past illness is there any pro

616
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
GeForce

617
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,360
Do you get to the mention of the enemy who the force is supposed to be

618
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
And it seems to be

619
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
Very limited language

620
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Give me maybe we can shoot everybody

621
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,136
Body or anybody know only the people who planned authorized committed or aided the Terrace

622
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Attacks

623
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,048
It occurred on September 11th 2001 or Harbor touchdowns much more

624
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
Which is why a lot of congressmen and women voted for it

625
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Joe Biden

626
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,216
On the day of the vote September 14th 2001

627
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
He says

628
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
Look people don't freak out about this language

629
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,104
Relates to the incident

630
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
And has broad Authority related incident

631
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
It does not relate to all terrorism every place cuz it just talking about Al-Qaeda who did this and the Taliban who have

632
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Harbor Freight

633
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Nope

634
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
Not necessarily

635
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,792
Gregory Johnson against overtime what happened is there's been this other sort of

636
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Catch-all category

637
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,496
That has been read into b60 word even though it appears nowhere in these 60 words

638
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,824
In a catch-all category is associated Force

639
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Associative

640
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah what we've been calling me 61st and 62nd

641
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,368
If you define the enemy as Al-Qaeda the Taliban and Associated forces

642
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
It's a whole different ball game

643
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,560
So you read those those all those words that did not include the phrase Associated forces is nowhere in the

644
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
So where does

645
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
So then why could people cite something it isn't in the back during mysteries of a bit

646
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
So the earliest example that we could

647
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Find

648
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,640
Of those two words is in a 2004 Memo from

649
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
Deputy secretary of defense Paul wolfowitz

650
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,040
It defines of Mao Qaeda Taliban and Associated forces

651
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
The truth is

652
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
It may have just been there from the beginning

653
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Play me is according to Ben Willis

654
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
From The Brookings institution there is a concept

655
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
In the laws of war

656
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Called co-belligerent

657
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,936
It's the idea that if you're at war with personae

658
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,288
And person B is on person is side in the war

659
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,080
You're also legally at war with

660
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Person B

661
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
Makes perfect sense if you think of it traditional War

662
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
We're at war with Germany

663
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Italy joins our side so by default we're at war with Italy to write

664
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
So just transpose out here if we're

665
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
War with this group called

666
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Al-Qaeda and a certain set of groups

667
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
There aren't them

668
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
Join the war on Al-Qaeda side when you are legally at war with them

669
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
You don't think about that too hard it is

670
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Crystal clear

671
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
But then the question that has arisen over time

672
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
Is how broad

673
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Do you make that

674
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
That Circle

675
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
Is the problem

676
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
BECU

677
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
We're not talking about nation-states any

678
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
Are we talking about group

679
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
So okay

680
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:52,832
How close does the linked to Al-Qaeda and the people who carried out September 11th have to be

681
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
So if you have someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who is connected to September 11th is that a no

682
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Or is it only three legs

683
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,072
Or can you be an associate in Minnesota

684
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
Now we can't exactly know how broadly the Obama and Bush administrations have

685
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Define those words

686
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
We'll talk about why in a second

687
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
But you just have to look at the news

688
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
You could see that

689
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,432
Like we started with a war that was in Afghanistan and then it spread to

690
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Gelato different places

691
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Pakistan

692
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Libya

693
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,624
Somalia Yemen yeah and there's a lot of debate in a lot of discussion

694
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
About like is this legal

695
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
Does this have anything to do with September 11th anymore cuz now the group in Yemen al-Qaeda in the Arabian put in

696
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
And so which is a group that that was first formed in 2009 they have their own hierarchy and their own structure and it's not

697
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Not clear

698
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
How

699
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
In what

700
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Fashion

701
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
They take orders

702
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
From

703
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,456
Either Osama Bin Laden why he was still alive or now I have another one

704
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:57,600
So does this make them and Associated force or does it make them part of al-Qaeda

705
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,440
Dancer leaps on

706
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
2011 MKT.

707
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:08,864
On your calendar December 30th 2011 seem to be yes when the US assassinated two members of the group

708
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,264
This is not confirmed yet but they could very well have been a US predator drone strike that is a US government

709
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,896
Attack to put all this in contact between 2002 and 2014 according to some estimates

710
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
They're going about 65 drone strikes in Yemen

711
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Killing about 400 people

712
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
So much hinges on how you define those

713
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
So much is in the definition

714
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
I asked the Pentagon I said

715
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Who

716
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:38,560
What are the list of associated forces to Al-Qaeda yes the u.s. is a war that's clear

717
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
What about the other

718
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Al-shabaab

719
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Buchheit in Iraq

720
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
Al-Qaeda in the Islamic maghreb armed Islamic group

721
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
Who are these groups who is the US at war with

722
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
In the Pentagon emailed me back and they said

723
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
The list is classified and offer

724
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
For public release

725
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
Wait so we

726
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
Who we are at war with any don't know

727
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
I see you saying

728
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,488
When you approached the Pentagon they said that they will not tell you the names of the people were at War again

729
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Well maybe they shouldn't

730
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Don't you want to know as a citizen of America

731
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
Fighting on the other hand do I want to know as

732
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
If the United States has determined

733
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
That I am dangerous to it

734
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
If it announced

735
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
Then that would give me a certain amount of

736
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Notice

737
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
2D is this advantageous

738
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
United States

739
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
It could also though

740
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Act as a disincentive for you to

741
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
To take action

742
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Baby

743
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
But maybe not

744
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Maybe they will just

745
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Quieter

746
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
More dangerous

747
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Mystery there might be reasons for

748
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:50,240
They have not wanted to provide a public list because they this is John Bellinger again

749
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
The group's move all the time and so if you say well

750
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
These were associated groups while then

751
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Certain people just move

752
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Group beta Group B

753
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
And they also want to leave these different groups guess

754
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,320
But it still raises democratic

755
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
Insurance if the America

756
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
Can people don't really know

757
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Who the execu

758
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Git branch believes is covered by the aumf

759
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,816
In the Democracy in a representative democracy

760
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,912
That has to be weighed out should the citizens of the United States

761
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
No

762
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:25,824
Who it is that the United States is targeting for Death Around the World who it is that the United States

763
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Technically at war with

764
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
Should War be a decision that the citizens of a democracy of a representative democracy have a say it

765
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
Presented rameses you just said so I'm assuming that

766
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Chairman of the house intelligence committee knows every item on

767
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,232
I'm not so sure morning everybody today to

768
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
Receive testimonial

769
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
The law of armed

770
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,936
Conflict one of the more interesting Senate hearings took place in early 2013

771
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,776
The 2001 authorization for the use of military force

772
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
The aumf

773
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Who is the Senate armed services

774
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Dyskinetic

775
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,456
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan chairman of the committee

776
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,528
Senator McCain is on the committee like you're welcome or whipped

777
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,856
Gregory says the Senators called a couple of Defense

778
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Department official

779
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Answer question members committee thank

780
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,208
The opportunity to testify

781
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,280
About the legal framework for the US military operations

782
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Defend our nation

783
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
Cuz they want to know like

784
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,168
Now that we're 12 years into this war how are you using the stock

785
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Does need to be changed

786
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
So the Department of Defense officials in there were four of them

787
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Came and said look I believe that existing

788
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Authorities are adequate

789
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
Disarm comfort

790
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
Don't revisit this sentence don't repeal it

791
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,344
This sentence is sufficiently gives us all the power that we need

792
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,416
And Associated forces are laying out their case

793
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
They say those two words

794
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
Associated Force

795
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Associated Force

796
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
Associated forces over and over and Associated force and Associated forces

797
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
Shaded forces and their Associated forces Associated for an Associated forces instead of just nodding along a lot of the time

798
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
Others were like what

799
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
Dylan. I've only been here five months but this is the most astounding and most astoundingly disturbing hearing

800
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
That I've been to since I've been here you guys have essentially Rewritten the Constitution here today

801
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,976
That's Angus King independent senator from Maine and you keep using the term Associated forces you use it 13

802
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,048
18 * in your statement that is not in the aumf

803
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:27,936
And you said it one point it suits us very well I assume it does suit you very well because you're reading it

804
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
To cover everything

805
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,824
Who won the most striking moments of this hearing is when the head of the committee

806
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,152
Senator Carl Levin turns one of the dod officials and asks

807
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Is there a list

808
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,504
Now there's an existing list

809
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
Two groups that are affiliated with Al-Qaeda

810
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,488
Senator I'm not sure there's a list per say I am very familiar with the organizations that we do consider

811
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,376
Right now are affiliated and I could provide you that with yes or we can do

812
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,936
When you add or subtract names from that list

813
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Could you let us know

814
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
We can do that as well mister

815
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
IQ

816
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,128
Let me see if I understand what you just said at a Committee hearing

817
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:13,504
Say US senator asks specifically so who's on the list of people were allowed to

818
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,368
That suggested that the Senate armed services committee who had oversight

819
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Really had no idea

820
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:26,560
Today's weather like all right if we don't have any idea who were at war with in the Senate armed services committee doesn't seem to have

821
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
And who does

822
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,472
One of the things that became clear to me as I was reporting on this

823
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Story

824
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,080
Was that many of the people who are making these decisions

825
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
I never been elected by anyone

826
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
The any position

827
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,296
And they were the ones who were making the decision not the elected representatives and so who are they

828
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
I guess so yeah

829
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:57,792
So we rooting around for a while looking for an answer to that question until we found this guy

830
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
Daniel kleiman he's a journalist and I've covered National Security and counterterrorism for many years and

831
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,032
Based on hundreds of confidential interviews that became his book Killer capture

832
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,080
He was able to paint a picture for us

833
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Who makes these decisions and how

834
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,688
He told us about these meetings you say it's the s

835
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:21,088
TV s meanings what are they who's in the room how did the events unfold these are they they call them

836
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,672
Civics meetings in the vernacular of

837
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
If your ochracea stands for secure

838
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
Video teleconference

839
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,120
Meetings described them as a sort of a massive top secret Google Hangout

840
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Chat with literally hundreds of people

841
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,728
From throughout the National Security bureaucracy

842
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
Login to decide who's on the list

843
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
You should live

844
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
You should die

845
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
You should literally hundreds literally hundreds of people now many of them are backbenchers they're not participate

846
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
Heading out in the call but they're taking notes

847
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,952
Before they get together in this meeting many the folks at this meeting he says they're giving a little packets of information on each Target they called

848
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Baseball

849
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,048
Sister look like it you got a picture and stats

850
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:08,448
Like Yogi Berra on one side and then you got his batting average in his hometown on the back of the terrorist equivalent of

851
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
Bald actor who is this person

852
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:14,848
Where does he Rank and what kinds of operations has he been involved in in the past

853
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:20,224
Eventually a general will come on the screen and say here's our Target objective Akron for some reason he says they was

854
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
For the targets by the name of American cities

855
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Subjective Toledo

856
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,952
General might say Target is an overhead an opportunity to kill this person can we legally do it

857
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
In the fascinating thing although maybe it won't come as much

858
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Surprises

859
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
People he's making this

860
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Is Pitch 2

861
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
I got generals but

862
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Lawyers

863
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,752
Are lawyers everywhere that is just a basic fact

864
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
Of Modern Warfare says John Bellinger

865
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,128
You know of lawyers on the ground with artillery units

866
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Tank commander

867
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,040
Lawyers in Kevlar lures and helicopters are lawyers really almost behind every bomb

868
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,648
Just lawyers everywhere and that's a very good thing

869
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
That's Harold Koh he was at

870
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
The top lawyer at the state department

871
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
2009 to two

872
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
Because it means that we're not just

873
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
Shooting why people willy-nilly or

874
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
Because we're angry at them right there

875
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Considered careful decision

876
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,056
No Harold kokori the den clivens reporting was

877
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
NOC

878
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
Tibbetts meetings and he would often be the one to answer the generals questions

879
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
Can we legally killed

880
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
So we asked him

881
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
If lawyers are now the ones deciding

882
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
True we are at war with Who We Are

883
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
How do you do it

884
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Unfortunately for us

885
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
I don't think I'm good

886
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Just call their mother

887
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
Audible methods but I'm

888
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
He said he couldn't comment on any of

889
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Classified

890
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
But

891
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Coco is a

892
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,984
Creative lawyer 40th and Clive

893
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
People familiar with

894
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
The process code in particular had a

895
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
A fascinating way

896
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
Determining who is and is not an associate

897
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
Another which we are or aren't at war with

898
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
And it seems to be less

899
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
About the groups as a whole and more about

900
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Individuals within the

901
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
For example

902
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
I see you already

903
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,975
That was an important issue for Co if you're going to Target a guy he has to be

904
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
A senior member

905
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
A group like Al-Qaeda

906
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:15,935
Yes be able to give orders and he has to be unique within the organization you couldn't simply under Harrell Costa Rica

907
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,263
Go after say a driver or a cook

908
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
Who was in al-Qaeda or even

909
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Foot soldiers

910
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,431
Because they were fungible

911
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
Meaning they could be easily

912
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Another criteria was

913
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
Whether they were externally Orion

914
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,159
Forco if they were just participants in a civil war you couldn't Target

915
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
But if they were targeting westerners

916
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Or Western interests

917
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Then yes

918
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
So if you take Dan kleinman's account

919
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
Criteria as representative

920
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
And we first have no way of verifying

921
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,031
If you take that as the norm then maybe there is

922
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Strong wedding

923
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
But I interviewed

924
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Numerous people who

925
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
Participated in these meeting

926
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
Shenzhen one of the things that

927
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
I heard over and over again

928
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Was it there was this

929
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
This kind of

930
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Inexorable

931
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Momentum

932
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
Toward killing

933
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
And that

934
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
At the military people in these meetings

935
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,327
Could speak with a kind of a tone of Do or Die origin see if Act 2 of the people

936
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
Who I quote in my book

937
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Used exactly the same metaphor

938
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Describe

939
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
That sense of momentum that was very good

940
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
Ultra zest

941
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
It was like

942
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
Standing

943
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
Train track with a

944
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
Train hurtling towards Hemet

945
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
A hundred miles an hour

946
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Then I guess like

947
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,319
Play the important question for me is like how often do they say no

948
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,927
Well you should be 99 * yes and one time now or 50

949
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,255
2 times yes in 50 times know how many Noah's Ark

950
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
Well look I'd say I did not come across

951
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,399
Many many examples but he did tell us

952
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
About this one is

953
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
This is a

954
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
Meeting between the top lawyer at

955
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,079
The defense department in a man named Jay Johnson

956
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
And the top lawyer at the state department

957
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
Open todoist and parallel Harold Koh

958
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,759
Anacortes dansources Harold Cohen J Johnson worth

959
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
We're faced with

960
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
Determining the Fate

961
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Aveda

962
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
40 year old man

963
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Roughly 4

964
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
What are you named scaife wolfed are robo

965
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
I think that's the right but it's

966
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,535
I'm not sure he's a member of these Smalley group al-shabaab

967
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
And Picante

968
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,679
World Cup Celebrations of 10-2 tragedy in the Central African nation of Uganda

969
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
A few months before this conversation is in 2010

970
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,823
Al-shabaab bombed a rugby club and a restaurant

971
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
At the same time in Uganda

972
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Killing 74 people

973
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Broken chairs

974
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,943
Smash table

975
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
And the sounds of pain

976
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
As Rescuers search for the living

977
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
And the dead

978
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
So that just happen

979
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
And according to Dan Kleinman at this moment

980
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Intelligencer

981
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
There was a debate raging

982
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,255
Weather al-shabaab should

983
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
Or should not be considered an

984
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:55,423
At the time their leader had sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden

985
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,519
But their agenda was primarily a local

986
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Agenda

987
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
Player never struck out

988
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
Against the United States

989
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Sore against American interests

990
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
In the region

991
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,247
So you got the top lawyer at the state department and the top floor

992
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Pentagon facing off

993
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
That's the weather this fellow robo

994
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Al Shabaab

995
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Should live or die

996
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,999
How does this work if somebody just like this someone pound the table or yes this was this was a very

997
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,351
Heated meeting Jay Johnson argued vehemently that

998
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,679
Robo was covered under the aumf

999
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
He was after all a founding member of

1000
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Carolco

1001
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
Vehemently disagreed

1002
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
Harold code conclusion based on the evidence

1003
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
Any intelligence

1004
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Did he saw

1005
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,967
Was it Robo was not externally focused

1006
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:45,087
In fact he belong to a faction of al-shabaab that was arguing against attacking

1007
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
Did the United States and other Western entry

1008
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,255
Still going to climb in these two men went back and forth and back and forth until eventually Harold Co

1009
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Is Drew a hard mode

1010
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:59,423
Look if you do this you need to know that you will be doing it over the unambiguous

1011
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
Objections

1012
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Of the state Department's legal

1013
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,591
The unambiguous movie that's very strong language

1014
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
Which coming from a lawyer

1015
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
And the signal that is sent

1016
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Tattoo the White House

1017
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Housewives

1018
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
You will be taking

1019
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
Military action even though

1020
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
The top layer of the state finance said that this would be

1021
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Illegal a

1022
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,975
Okay so what happened did they decide not to they did not do it

1023
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
Academic

1024
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
It's it's

1025
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Live

1026
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
Depends on which way the decision goes

1027
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111
11 mm

1028
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951

1029
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
Jim Donaghy

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
One sentence

1040
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
60 words that's all

1041
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,959
It's the 2001 authorization to use military

1042
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
Dayforce sign in salons

1043
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
September 18th

1044
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
2001

1045
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567

Reporter Gregory johnsen we have

1047
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
We have manhandled diesel

1048
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Yeah we have dissected we have by size

1049
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
Second trifecta

1050
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:53,343
Did you quadrisect it to the aumf as it's called

1051
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
Yes and you know we've looked at how that these two sentences

1052
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Define flask

1053
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
12 years

1054
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Counter-terrorism now

1055
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
How would Define our future

1056
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
General thank you for being here today this is

1057
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,143
So we were thinking about that Senate armed services

1058
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,447
This Committee hearing we ended up calling someone who sat on the

1059
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Tim Kaine senator from Virginia

1060
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Who is there

1061
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Yeah that what's up

1062
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
That was a very

1063
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
Kind of hair-raising day

1064
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,271
And Senator Kaine told us that one of the most hair-raising moments for him was when one of his fellow Senators Lindsey Graham

1065
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Fast one of the Department of Defense

1066
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,183
Officials Gear graywood with May the war against radical Islam or Tara whatever

1067
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
Description like to provide

1068
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,559
Will go on after the second term of President Obama

1069
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Another words

1070
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,911
How long do you think this particular War

1071
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
As declared in the section is going to go on

1072
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:45,055
Leonard my judgment this is going to go on for quite a while and yes beyond the Turks

1073
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
Second term of

1074
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
The president & Beyond this term of congress

1075
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,943
Yes sir I think it's at least 10 to 20 years

1076
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
It was chilly

1077
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,647
Cuz like this is already the longest war in history United States Vietnam

1078
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
And now a DOD official as saying add-on 10 or 20 years so I said

1079
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:11,935
The administration's position that you tell me if somebody is born after 9/11

1080
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:18,335
Let's imagine in 2030 they join a group that is just become associated with Al-Qaeda

1081
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:24,735
Is it the administration's position that the aumf would would cover them in those organization and without hesitation

1082
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:31,135
Can the administration Witnesses said yes as long as they become an Associated Force Under

1083
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:36,767
That's a legal standard that was set out it it's not limited in time

1084
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
Not limited in geography

1085
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Really traveling

1086
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:46,751
But you know I'm also trouble by another thing and then you know the iconic and it's a New York picture of the

1087
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,919
VJ Day kiss in Times Square

1088
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
August 14th 1945

1089
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,063
Did there oughta be a day where those who have served in war

1090
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
That you declare that the war is over and then you celebrate them

1091
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
You can ask sometimes by service

1092
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
Family sucks

1093
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
Is going to end yours ever come up

1094
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
Yes yes

1095
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,407
He told us it's something like one and three people in his state of Virginia are connected to the military

1096
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
So he does get that question a lot

1097
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
And the truth is

1098
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
We all want to be

1099
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Need

1100
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,439
Inside 7 days after that Senate armed services Committee hearing

1101
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
President Obama

1102
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
It is a great honor

1103
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Give a speech

1104
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
To return

1105
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
2

1106
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,375
The National Defense University

1107
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
We seem to say basically

1108
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
It's time for war

1109
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Like all wars

1110
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
Mustang

1111
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
That's what history advises

1112
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:03,039
That is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing authorization to use military force

1113
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Where are you I'm at

1114
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,135
Best Lionel says that he would like to get rid of those 60 words

1115
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
And in this war

1116
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,023
Yeah but Common Sense tells you

1117
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,303
That these are

1118
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,447
Different kind of enemy not a state or government they just they make war

1119
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:27,615
It a different way Senator McCain has a great wind you guys look where in Ancient Warfare where the war isn't going to end with the signing of a peace

1120
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
History on the deck of the Destroyer that's not how it happens these days there's no clear start and ending and yet the president

1121
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
He wants to end the war

1122
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Set timer

1123
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,647
Every war has come to an end he sees himself

1124
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
As a person who came in

1125
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:47,583
To a country fighting two Wars and he brought them all to an end and I think he wants

1126
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,911
To have done that but how how do you how do you do that

1127
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
How do you end a war

1128
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
When the vast amount of people

1129
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
But you're calling the enemy

1130
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Haven't stopped fighting so

1131
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
What he does

1132
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
In the maze

1133
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
And it's extremely clever

1134
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
And by the way

1135
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,295
It's really well lawyer

1136
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
Is he announces a set of rules

1137
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:16,511
Going forward for drone strikes strikes to punish individual we act against Harris

1138
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Propose a continuing

1139
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
An eminent

1140
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,655
Threat to the American people that he's only going to use drone strike

1141
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,447
When there's an imminent threat

1142
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Consuela understood

1143
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Who understands

1144
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,127
The fit in the Constitution and also in international law

1145
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,943
President allowed to act unilaterally

1146
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
In self-defense

1147
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
When there is an imminent

1148
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Threat

1149
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Meeting a surgeon

1150
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,623
And you can't feasibly capture that

1151
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
Ben fears that what President Obama was doing there

1152
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,999
Thereby stressing that word

1153
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
An eminent

1154
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Threat to the American people

1155
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,863
Is it he was laying a New Foundation

1156
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,983
You saying when the aumf and I wanted to end

1157
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
I do have another way of justifying

1158
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
All these things

1159
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Maybe they wouldn't change

1160
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
The drone strikes in the raids with

1161
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:10,527
Continue as long as you have a capacious enough understanding of what the word imminent means

1162
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,111
You might be able to continue a whole lot of this stuff

1163
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:20,767
And then you don't have to go to Congress at all and you can say you've ended the war

1164
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:27,167
War and the human rights groups will cheer for you and

1165
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,799
We're going to mysterious we find that there are a whole lot of imminent threats for free

1166
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
Thank you very much everybody God bless you

1167
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,759
May God bless the United States of America

1168
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:47,903
And in the context of what happened to the 60 words you do have to wonder

1169
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,951
What's going to happen to a word like Eminem

1170
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,559
And all the while according to been witness and pretty much everyone we spoke with

1171
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:01,471
Haven't really answered the big questions when do we want to attack the enemy who is

1172
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,871
The enemy and if we're going to be fighting them even when we're not technically at war with them and what's

1173
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
The difference between War and Peace

1174
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,583
And that's why this whole subject is so unsettling if you don't know

1175
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,727
The common sense definition any more of when you're at War and when you're at peace then how do you

1176
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,519
How do you write rules

1177
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,847
Yeah this was an attempt to begin a war

1178
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
And so it has the usual beginning quick okay you who are you

1179
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,247
Are you out there where

1180
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,087
You for how long till you surrender another not going to like

1181
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
All the usual

1182
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,975
A business of warfare is it doesn't apply in this case so they have nothing in the house what do we do

1183
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
Just like one long improvisation

1184
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
