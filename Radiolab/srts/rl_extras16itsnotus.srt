At WNYC Studios note to self

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632

00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:42,496
Thank you sir there we are yes and I am here pinch-hitting for Dad for a little bit

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
To spread the word that this is an important time for Radiolab Robert

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
The year the giving time of the year we're about to do I say

00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456

Will Be Kind of Wonderful

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Because

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
We who make the show and you who listen to this

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Show don't often have a chance

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
To get together so in the next bit of time what we're going to do is we're going to pass

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
We've invited some of the p

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,168
People who normally listen to come on the show and people who Donnelly make the show come and listen

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
When mixing it up a little bit

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,592
It's a strange menagerie of humans and we want to just go to the zoo of us

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,736
That's coming right up but if you'd like to hit pause just for a second and make a contribution right away like right now

24
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
You can enjoy the episode knowing that you already done the thing that you were supposed to do that we're going to be on our knees begging you to do what

25
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
You've already done it I guess that's already

26
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
You already

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Do you want me to take you

29
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Robert is beating around the bush

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
Radiolab relies on the

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
Support of listener contributions

32
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Listeners like you yes

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
Who make all the stories that we put

34
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,480
Also it's time that we extend a hand to you are podcast listeners

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
Invite you to make a financial contribution

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,672
So that Radiolab can keep these episodes coming your way it is super easy to do

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
We asked you to go to radiolab.org donate to give

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
Or even easier if you live in the US

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Open up your phone

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Probably what you're listening on anyway

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Open up the messaging app

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,032
Type the word Radiolab to the number 6 9 8

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Fix it

44
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
That'll get you started

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
But suppose you live in Montevideo Uruguay or in Zagreb Yugoslavia

46
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,784
A country that no longer exist what do you have to do then

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,648
Let's go to radiolab.org donate that's what I always do whenever I'm in Central Europe

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Southeast America

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
It's really easy so don't be intimidated

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Now

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,912
As we promised it is time for you to meet some people who you here on our show but have never really met

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,056
Aryan whack produces a part of my show she's never met them either so this was her chance to find out about them

53
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Our chance

54
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
To find out about

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
What is this Terry

56
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Did I lose you

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,416
Hi how are you how are you in your email

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Why don't you know

59
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,608
All right so I decided to call this woman that I have just been desperately curious about

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
4

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Years now

62
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
Since I've worked here

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,592
The reason well I've been wanting to reach out to you for a while because

64
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Part of my job here is to listen to

65
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
All of the spots that come in for our underwriting and I like

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,856
Choose the reason produce them and put them into the episodes I need to go in

67
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Tobacco for a second we have our listeners

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
Submit underwriting reads via the app

69
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
And

70
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
We put them into the break of our shows if you've listened to the show with any regularity you've probably heard this

71
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
And

72
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Jesus carry babcock lumish

In a pinch I need a spot quick I know that there's going

82
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720

From Thierry Henry Babcock

84

00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Terry Babcock

91
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,951
What sound of Honolulu and like I know it like when your husband is around

92
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Brian Babcock

00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Chocolate milk

00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
I mean it is all day sound like evidence that I

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
Gathered from your phone calls in the background noises and what not

97
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
You're awesome this is really funny

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
What's your hypothesis

99
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
My hypothesis will you live

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
In

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
Cold Spring for a while and I was like she doesn't

102
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
She sounds

103
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
Too young to be like a like a snowbird so I didn't think that you guys had moved for the weather

104
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
Like somebody must have gotten a job down there

105
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
You have grandkids

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
And I was surprised I had heard that a couple of times

107
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Or at least I sound like little kids

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
To me baby.

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,927
Anything because

110
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Mariners gear

111
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Yeah I would love the real story

112
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
No reason why I should have gotten mixed up with an army guy

113
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
So he's active duty military

114
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
And so we moved

115
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
4 years

116
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
With his army assignment

117
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Summer 2014

118
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Assignment to Hawaii and that's where we live

119
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Crown actually that makes me so happy

120
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Have you ever heard yourself

121
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631
When like you listen to Radiolab have you ever heard one of your reads

122
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
You can spend no

123
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
On a regular basis I'll get an email from

124
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
A former student or a friend or

125
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,735
Thing that they heard me on Radiolab

126
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
That I feel still

127
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
The tax firm

128
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,415
But no it never do you have a favorite episode

129
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
I don't know but I think

130
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
One of his things that I love is that you

131
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
Things that are very complex

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
And you make ardidas letters

133
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
Phenocrysts

134
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,799
Videos are black hole

135
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
You make them nauseous

136
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
Interesting

137
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,711
But accessible and exciting and then I remember it

138
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Yeah

139
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Well

140
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
I mean there's

141
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Frequently

142
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
Thirty different drafts of an episode

143
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
It's hard to like hear the finished product

144
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
That's just a listener

145
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Try again and not being like I didn't deposit that

146
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
P there

147
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
You know like other room tone there I could have smooth that out something you know and I meant I miss that a little

148
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
I guess I mean like I want to know like why you do it like why why you're so committed to like give

149
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Driving test

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
In this particular way

151
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
So

152
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
I feel like what you've asked of us

153
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Is solo

154
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
NC weather

155
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Public Radio

156
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Or it's me

157
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
It's something I can do

158
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Okay

159
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
Yeah whatever we've lives as one

160
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
No it really is a soundtrack of my life and

161
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
I could be wrong but I feel like for plenty of people they're concerned that they can't give a big chest

162
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
That

163
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
DeSean Jackson

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
I think about

165
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
No Ethan just a little tiny

166
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
What would happen if your coffee

167
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
I think people feel like that's not enough but

168
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
And I don't

169
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
I think we should underestimate

170
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And

171
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
So

172
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
It's going to be New York if I can take you for a cup of coffee

173
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
I'll be happy to

174
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
That would be great thank you so much

175
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
Really enjoyed this conversation

176
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
I didn't know if you were

177
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Man Down

178
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Really

179
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,879
Menucha here's the thing about Terry is that she's one of a lot of

180
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927

00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
But in very particular ways like

186
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
Like when you meet them, I really whatever that thing you do they don't do that

187
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Very specific

188
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
Either complements or arguments but it's

189
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
Their listeners

190
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Meeting Dave listen

191
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,647
Robert I think what you're saying is the listeners you listeners not only do you give

192
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Your time you give your brains the brain remember you give contributions

193
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
What is what keeps Radiolab on the air

194
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,495
And in order for 2017 to knock it out of the park like 2016 did

195
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
We need you to keep doing that if you were just sitting here talking about like

196
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Maybe okay maybe now

197
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
What would you do right now if you want it

198
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
You would go online to radiolab.org donate

199
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
To give

200
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Is Radiolab spelled

201
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,279
It's two words or one now it's just one or even easier just

202
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Text that one word

203
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Radiolab

204
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
2 the number 698

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Fix it

206
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
To get started that's if

207
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
If you're in the US

208
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
In any case so you can get it handled in a matter of seconds and Wheatland

209
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Yeah we really do

210
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
I know

211
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Introduction to one of our listeners

212
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
I recently met

213
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
The three things that I say I love about this country

214
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
A festival

215
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
You're drinking water coming out of your faucet

216
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
It's insane

217
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,047
Yo-yo thirsty in the middle of a shower you just open your mouth when you're done

218
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
It's incredible

219
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,423
So this is mayank Mishra he's a graduate student in ecology at princeton university

220
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
When is Bike Lanes

221
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Fantastic

222
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Yeah

223
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Because I said

224
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
You should try riding a bike in Calcutta Ohio Deli it's

225
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
It's

226
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
It'll definitely get you closer to God

227
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
That's what ya God does exist in India

228
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,671
So my aunt started out as a civil rights lawyer in India often defending people who he thought have been

229
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
Give without cause

230
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
He left for the United States

231
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
In part because he had sued the man who was

232
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Simply became the prime minister

233
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Of India

234
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
And he thought maybe I

235
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
You should go somewhere else

236
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,079
Dove and the tub thing I love about this country

237
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Was internet I mean just

238
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
Really great internet where I could listen to things

239
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
All the time

240
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,575
And also I heard Radiolab was when I first started listening to podcasts

241
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,719
I first met my time after giving a lecture up at Princeton University came up afterwards and he said you owe

242
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
I want to tell you about the

243
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
First time I heard

244
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Keurig Radiolab

245
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
Okay so you was on a road trip with some of this

246
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
Fellow students so I was supposed to be navigating

247
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,775
I was just graduating from my masters in public administration from Princeton

248
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
We would done with

249
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
School

250
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
But he was still getting to know each other

251
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Because

252
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,271
You don't know if he was done with it we knew each other but we didn't quite know where everyone came from

253
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
And people going

254
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
The beach house the entire class

255
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Was going bad

256
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
Tifosi farewell and you don't spend a

257
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
A few days together

258
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
And I was supposed to be navigating and I got everything wrong

259
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
And we went miles away

260
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
And I song talking about

261
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
How I have to deal with the loss of my father than my grandfather

262
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Boots

263
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Michael's friend

264
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
And

265
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,687
Have you also having to deal with the fact that we were going to leave the

266
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Place behind

267
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
And leave this

268
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
Community behind the feud filmed over the past two years the first one

269
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
I had in the US

270
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Someone said you were busy

271
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Incredibly

272
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
Greed Episode by Radiolab on

273
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
Life After Life I think of

274
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,863
That was our afterlife episode it was a series of meditations

275
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
Undeath this hour we ask that question I did what happened

276
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,407
At the very moment when you slip from life to the other side and what happens after

277
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
And resulting it I was just stunned silence

278
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Susie

279
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Entire thing

280
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
And once the

281
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Was it seems that's always stuck with me

282
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Is the

283
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
I remember you were talking about a group and it said

284
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,839
What happens when the group dispersed some people go their separate ways

285
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
Does a group die or do they carry

286
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
It with them this was a short fiction p

287
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Peace by the neurology

288
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
Is David Eagleman which was right on our show by the actor Jeffrey Tambor

289
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
When soldiers part ways at War's end

290
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,991
The breakup of the platoon figures the same emotion as the

291
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Well the death of a person

292
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Participants

293
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
Gamble away feeling that they were just part of something larger than themselves something they into it had a life

294
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
Even though I can't quite put a finger on it

295
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
In this way death is not only for humans but for everything

296
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
That exist

297
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
And it turns out that anything that enjoys life

298
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Enjoys an afterlife

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
And then there was something about when you pass away

300
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
What happens to the

301
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Do the things that make you up when you die

302
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
You agree

303
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
My orgasms

304
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Of which Eureka MO

305
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Weather in sheets of Scandal

306
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Communities of spleen by with your death

307
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Did they don't die

308
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
Instead they they part ways moving off in their separate directions mourning the loss of a special time they shared to get

309
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
Actually haunted by feeling them

310
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Everyone's playing Parts in something

311
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Larger

312
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Femdom self

313
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Something

314
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
That has its own life

315
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Something that

316
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Macon

317
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Are they

318
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Butterfinger

319
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
And I think I don't know I had not told about things that way

320
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
I'd never thought about where life begins and

321
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Raiden

322
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
And my uncle mentioned another Eagleman piece that causes a year

323
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
There was this one thing that you said which was

324
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,335
That's one way of looking at death

325
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Is

326
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
When the Lost person

327
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Speaks your name

328
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
That's when you're gone

329
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
There

330
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
R3

331
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Guess

332
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Now the first is when the body

333
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
The second is when the body

334
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Consigned

335
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Foot in the grave

336
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
The third is that moment

337
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Sometime in the future when your name is spoken

338
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
For the last time

339
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
With my father and my grandfather

340
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
You know the TV

341
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
Forget them today

342
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
UWE

343
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Stop bossing on their stories in

344
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
No one remembers him

345
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
That's when

346
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
That's when they're gone

347
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
That's actually gone

348
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
So you're listening to this

349
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,791
Are they any other people listening and there's this kind of Deep Quiet in the car

350
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah and then what

351
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,703
So that happened and then that was my introduction to listening to podcast

352
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
So then I started listen to Radiolab more

353
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,103
And who did you have a lot of time on your head about what's going on after school what happened

354
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
So what happened was

355
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Even in school

356
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
I've been a loyal

357
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
I had reached this point where I thought

358
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,951
You know I was done with human beings I was done with human right I was done with all of that stuff because I felt like

359
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
The we were just

360
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
Too far beyond

361
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Receiving

362
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
And I feel like

363
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Clearly this is not where I should be

364
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Because there's

365
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
A big Oval Drive trivia some affinity

366
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
But what are you what are you decide to

367
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Do

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
What was the news

369
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
I wanted to go back to school

370
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
I wanted to study ecology

371
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
And I attended the

372
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
That's awesome

373
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Ecology

374
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
I'm completely blew my mind and I decided

375
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,391
You look good I'm not on the right path maybe this is about

376
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Should be on

377
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,023
I remember we was living in Brooklyn right across from the botanic gardens

378
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
And

379
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,887
Even through the winter I go there and I will listen to Radiolab

380
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Honda

381
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Everytime I think of Radiolab I think of

382
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Smiles and tears

383
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
So streaming down my face

384
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Because

385
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
There's always

386
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
So much emotion to tell if backed into it

387
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
Babysitting the

388
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
In the cold

389
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
In the snow in the botanic gardens no one else around

390
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
With a small notebook

391
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,023
I'll listen to Radiolab and every time something would come into my head at jot it down

392
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
So sitting there in the botanic gardens listening to us like what what what

393
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
To the Dufour

394
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
So open me up and help me together

395
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Did both things right

396
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
Open me up to

397
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
The new world

398
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
If ideas and Thompson

399
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,175
A community of people who

400
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
Also have similar thoughts

401
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
You also want to find out more about what

402
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Going on

403
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
And also help me together because I was

404
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Sold by myself

405
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
I'm very very fortunate

406
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
Have my wife with me and she was

407
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
Let me she's been a huge bill of Sapulpa

408
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
We have bolts

409
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
So to step out of our comfort zone

410
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
An affordable Visa

411
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
To some extent

412
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Because of Radiolab

413
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
Every time I hear the

414
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Opening credits of Radiolab

415
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,319
It feels like I'm just stepped back home from the cold or something it's just

416
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
You don't shake off

417
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
All the snow from your jacket

418
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Unsettling

419
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
You do feel like you sort of

420
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Solve something

421
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
I hope not

422
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,119
I hope not but I totally feel

423
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Are you happy about where I am

424
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
It's interesting

425
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Because

426
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
If you if you listen to the show we do we never solve anything

427
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
That's right yeah

428
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
You never do

429
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
So you know what this was

430
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
This is something I've been thinking about a lot recently and I was speaking to a very close friend about this

431
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
I was thinking about what is the rule

432
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Scientist

433
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
And I found it

434
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,743
More recently been there have been things that make me

435
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,583
Wonder what the scientific Community is looking out for some time

436
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
I think sometimes

437
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Will Solace caught up in

438
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
Our credibility and the fact

439
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
We must maintain The credibility and we shouldn't break rank

440
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Put new one

441
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,199
Becomes a scientist because they read a really credible

442
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Scientific

443
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
FIFA

444
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,087
Bereaved did they become scientists because they're inspired by

445
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,183
This world around them and they're just really curious about what's going on

446
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
You inspired me to

447
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
To be more curious

448
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Beretta

449
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
To recognize that we don't have answers

450
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
And sometimes just looking for questions

451
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
Is enjoyable it's a lot of fun

452
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,639
What I do together

453
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
To be looking for things together to go on this treasure hunt

454
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Around life together

455
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
That's home

456
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,415
Robert I think I might be in love with my uncle

457
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
When we shook hands I remember like holding onto his hand like for an ex

458
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Extra beat because

459
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
When you do this for a living you don't expect

460
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Do anything much more than tell a story

461
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
But if you can

462
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,871
If you can help somebody get out of a hole or climb a mountain or change

463
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,175
No change a life then like that

464
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Cherry

465
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
On top

466
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
Super duper cherry on top and I happens

467
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Carly

468
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Not on off and on

469
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Show

470
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
So that's really cool

471
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
And

472
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
And I just had to

473
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,048
Just say like if you listeners if Radiolab has touched your life

474
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
At some point in this past year doesn't mean they had to have a career makeover

475
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,056
It was just like it made you smile or it made you think about something a little bit

476
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Differently

477
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,944
We ask you to remember you're part of a community and this community

478
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,504
Is held together with listener contrib

479
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
It really is what keeps

480
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Radiolab

481
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
So let's suppose you were in the mood to give

482
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
Radiolab something how would you go about

483
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Play easy rock

484
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
Okay let me just take me through it slowly and step-by-step

485
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
Stewart fast. Org donate

486
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
You listening on your phone it's really easy opening up

487
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,200
Messaging app that you got there

488
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Very good

489
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
Text the word Radiolab spelled fully out

490
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
To the number 69866

491
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Six nine

492
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Now what

493
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,864
Oh now okay I'll leave it a story to tell producer Eddie McEwen

494
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Who was who wanted to meet somebody

495
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
Well you don't want to meet her so here we go

496
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,408
Okay so a few months back we did a story called alpha-gal

497
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
I'm getting nervous

498
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:49,088
And the star of that show was a woman named Amy Pearl get my EpiPen

499
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Allergic

500
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
To radio greatness

501
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,512
That I know of has been really exposed to that yet

502
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
I'm Robert.

503
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
The story was about any pearls

504
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Allergy to red meat and how she got the allergy to red meat so I'm going to tell you anymore she goes in the story lesson right now

505
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,408
But the reaction got from the audience on Twitter and in comments on our website which is insane you should we get kind of like

506
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
You know the outcome and hear their love the show hate the show where's

507
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Science stuff like that

508
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
But this time it was just like this

509
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,904
Huge outpouring of deep deep love for Amy Pearl

510
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
You don't get that girl her own show she's incredible she changed my life Amy Pearl for president was one of the tweets

511
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
And I felt the same love her that everyone else did in my Java the show is again a lot of cutting tape and sound design and

512
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Music and stuff like that

513
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
So I never actually like met her before but I met her through her voice

514
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
And I also

515
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Thought how she's very wise

516
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,968
In ways I feel like I really need in my life right now

517
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
And so this is one way to get more it'll bring more Amy Pearl back into our lives again which feels good

518
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Good hello hey

519
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
Also it was sort of an opportunity for me to ask

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
A question I wanted to kind of

521
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,912
But I recently moved here from a really small town in Canada and I'm

522
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Trying to

523
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
Figure out how do I be a human being in the city and

524
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
Just letting you know not let it well I mean it's like

525
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
I mean do you ever hear there's a famous saying

526
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Did you ever hear it

527
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
If you can make it here

528
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,320
If you can make it anywhere

529
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
It's up to you

530
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,464
New York true everything is so hard in the city

531
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
I mean forget it it's like

00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
I'm like I have to renew my driver's license or driver's license you're a big trouble oh my God everybody

Unlike all you have to do is go for a minute like

Where my mom lives in Connecticut and I go up there and she's like

Well for sure a good thing about being in the city as if

549
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
You know

550
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368

You keep you can like I'm sure between now and the time you get home tonight you can like

552
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Pick up someone's pain like

00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,656
Vermont like tell somebody they have they have like toilet paper on their shoe

554
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
Help someone who seems lost for like smile at someone

555
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Seems down there be like oh my God I love that book that's like you have every opportunity to make someone else's day better

556
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
You could just be like

557
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
I'm a superhero

558
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
If something happens I'm going to rush over there and something might happen any second City it's like you know

559
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
And it's like

560
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
When you're walking around the city

561
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
I always find treasures like if

562
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
If you lucky

563
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
In the gutter

564
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
You just like

565
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328

567
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
So great and like

568
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Can you tell me

569
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
What's your

570
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
What's with the last time you really saw the city as beautiful

571
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Oh my God

572
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
God I think the last time I saw

573
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
The city is beautiful

574
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
Probably

575
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Last night

576
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,952
It was very dark and I got my dog and we went out like on the Block that I walk on

577
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
All the time

578
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
But somebody had

579
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
What's all the leaves and there was

580
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
A pile of

581
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Oakley

582
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
On the side

583
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,776
And the light from the house

584
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Lectin

585
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Every oak leaf look like

586
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Meloetta

587
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
MSN there such a pretty shape and I was like oh my God

588
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
These are just being thrown out by the tree

589
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,744
These are not even like of Youth and I was like well every single year it grows up

590
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Brand new Leaf

591
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
And then dropped it off and the girls another one dropped it off and grows another one drops it off at a must-have for like 200 years of Michael

592
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,592
Imagine how many leaves the tree drops off in like where does it all go and like what is all that energy coming from and why

593
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
Doing it

594
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
And it smells good

595
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Pretty

596
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Probably covered in dog piss but I didn't get that close

597
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,184
And I thought it was really beautiful and it was like

598
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
It was a good moment

599
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
Amy Pearl

600
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Bath

601
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,008
You don't like she was so when you hear Amy Pearl talk about anything

602
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
Dog pee is fine

603
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,920
Because Amy Pearl is what is what you would call a moor inn

604
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
F

605
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Tea

606
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
What's that a natural storyteller

607
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,112
There's no way yes there's no way she can't make everything interesting

608
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,208
And cheats to win this tape came in when we heard it we want oh my

609
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
My god get her on the air

610
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Friend don't take her off

611
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
We could just live on a mean girl

612
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,448
Now listen though Robert there's a reason why

613
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848
We were able to get Amy Pearl on the show

614
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Feel precious but don't always

615
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,968
Do the thing that precious things have to do in order to keep

616
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
Keep other precious things alive and well I don't know what that means but I think it was an attempt to say in a poetic way they

617
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
People who love the podcast

618
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
And give just a few dollars

619
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Make this work

620
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
Possible and exactly what I'm okay

621
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,680
And I want to add something we actually have some really great radiolab's swag

622
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
Yeah

623
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,848
There's a don't pretend you're not wearing the hoodie all the time very warm pudding

624
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
And if that's not your bag

625
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,528
There's a bag actually there's a knit winter cap

626
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
There's a t-shirt

627
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,624
There's lots of Swag and it you know what it is

628
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,232
I feel like listeners when you wear the Radiolab swag I see you on the street

629
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
And ice

630
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
I'm sure that when we look at each other we give

631
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,424
You can get the swag without making just a little donation

632
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
And we ask

633
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Funny you ask Robert let me

634
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,104
Tell you radiolab.org donate

635
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Or even easier

636
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
If you're in the u.s. text the word Radiolab to the number

637
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
If you're on your phone

638
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
698

639
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,440
Next up a story about a boy his mom football and lettuce Nasser left if is our producer

640
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Helium

641
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,560
You missed out with me broadcast this but he wanted to get into the game as it were

642
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
And here's

643
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
What happened next

644
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:03,008
Yeah and I actually chose

645
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
Our football episode American football it was actually the first episode I was on staff for

646
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
Checked it and it had all kinds of things that had a story about the history of football in the forward pass in the car

647
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,696
Carlisle Indian team but it also had kind of what is the big question now

648
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
What's the future the game

649
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
And that

650
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Question was

651
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
Perfectly encapsulated

652
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,912
By this interview with this woman

653
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Emily Bartell

654
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
You could add something like

655
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
She want

656
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,336
I'm on a Bartell I'm a Libra enjoy long walks on the beach

657
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,968
So this story came to us from our senior editor storm we literally just heard back there

658
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
And basically The Story Goes Like This

659
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,160
Tony Bartel is from a family that lives and breathes and bleeds

660
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
Football her dad Mel Farr the Superstar was a star running back for the Detroit

661
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
Lions he was a two-time pro bowler both her brothers were professional football players until 4 Monday 1

662
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
First son Parker

663
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,544
As soon as the doctor

664
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Saw his third thumb

665
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
We're going to the NFL baby yes and then Parker's 10001

666
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Announce

667
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
He's the biggest thing he walked out the room

668
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,488
I'm still going with 3rd Stop

669
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
She signed Parker up to

670
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,352
Play Little League when he was 4 years old

671
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
Immediately they named in the tank

672
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
The moment he gets on the field he is just

673
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
Wound through kids getting touchdown after

674
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Touchdown

675
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
But this is where things get complicated because

676
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
While Parker is on the field

677
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Dominate

678
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,528
Monet has a relative

679
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,416
Who played football for a very long time and was experiencing symptoms of CTE

680
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy

681
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
Which is the what comes from like

682
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Concussion questionnaire

683
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,376
Symptoms include memory loss sometimes bouts of anger

684
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
In this case

685
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
It was

686
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Depression it was

687
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,008
Suicidal Thoughts

688
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
It was

689
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
It was getting phone calls

690
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Like hey I need you to come

691
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Come get him

692
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Because

693
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
He's having dangerous

694
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Thoughts

695
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,136
And money told us that eventually her father started experiencing symptoms of CTE as well

696
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
And that

697
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Put money in a very

698
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Difficult position

699
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,072
Because on the one hand she believed that children should not play foot

700
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,168
But then it's exact same time she believed children should play football

701
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Did it say

702
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
Great sport

703
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
Jasper Parker

704
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Parker

705
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
How do you like the season

706
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
His favorite things

707
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Were the trophy and the pizza party at

708
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Had no desire

709
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
You want to play again next season

710
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Now

711
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,392
Now our favorite moment of this whole story and allow listeners to

712
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Who's win

713
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:09,632
Parker comes home from school and sits down with Soren and Monet and Soren ask

714
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
Look if you don't like football anymore do I go sports

715
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
I really want to do synchronized

716
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,944
What is a chair

717
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
Is that true

718
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
Mostly because when I saw something about it

719
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Kind of cool like

720
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,560
People are doing a lot of cool swimming tricks so I kind of thought it was

721
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Something for me

722
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
Just you playing me

723
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
Are synchronized swimming you like you're like this has been contacting me about football and I'm going to tell him that I

724
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
I want to do synchronized swimming

725
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
I know you like it

726
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Oh yes I'm going to do

727
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
And so

728
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,856
Hello hello hey Monday how you doing

729
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,256
Hey I'm good with you how are you today because at like every time now that I see football in the headline

730
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
And I I think of her

731
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
And I wanted to see how she was doing

732

Think about it all the time he's kind of my hero it has grown legs

737
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
I swear it's because of

738
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,760
That interview I was contacted about a month ago from ESPN

739
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Really

00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,880
Stout to me and they came out here and spent three days

741
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Interviewing Parker

742
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Following him around

743
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
You can't tell Parker anything now he thinks he's

744
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Hot Shi

745
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
He has now

746
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,752
Said in the interview with ESPN and you know I know they weren't waiting for him to say he was going to be a synchronized swimmer

747
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Now he switched it up

748
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,848
He wants to play dodgeball

749
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
Good sport Baldo there's a lot at there's a lot of hit like

750
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Unlike synchronized swimming dodgeballs kind of

751
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,808
Contact sport yeah he's not going to eat here

752
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
Please God phone gym

753
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
I just think this kids

754
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,440
Live embarrass the crap out of me

755
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,048
But that the series is about the love of football

756
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,120
And you know they said aside from

757
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Packers

758
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
You know

759
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
Let their up having such a present

760
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,568
In NFL in my immediate family

761
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,128
It was the thing of that ox

762
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
Seymour on the fact that I love

763
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Football so much

764
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
And that football is

765
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,368
Still extremely you know dangerous you know my father passed away last year

766
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
So sorry

767
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
My dad passed away in August

768
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
The last year which

769
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Threw us all for a loop

770
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,864
My dad was like the healthiest person that we know

771
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
And he

772
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
He dropped dead

773
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,520
Talk to him that morning the Monday and

774
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
At 7 p.m. that evening he he just

775
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
You just kind of slipped away

776
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
And we got his results back

777
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Send his brain and spinal cord

778
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
And my dad was at stage

779
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
3 of 4 with CTE

780
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
And that's the kind of thing you can only find out after

781
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
Is Dad right exactly was that where you started

782
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Expecting that at all

783
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
We knew my father suffered from CTE

784
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
That jokingly would say my

785
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,264
Having a conversation with my dad towards the end of his life

786
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,080
Would be like I'm 50 First Dates

787
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
Because my dad will

788
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Helm Hill

789
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
Talk to you like I don't remember such a

790
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,856
Remember you remember such as

791
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
But you don't really

792
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
You know you don't

793
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Think about it

794
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,512
And then getting the results back for my father

795
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
I'm like God

796
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
You know

797
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
Space force

798
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
Is Mike Webster

799
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,728
Just to jump in here Mike Webster was a former professional player

800
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,800
Who was suffering from Amnesia dementia depression

801
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
You died at the

802
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,920
Fees for CTE it's Junior sale

803
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,992
Junior Seau was another former professional player

804
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Shot himself in the

805
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Winchester 243 or

806
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
CH4 is something

807
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
But these families are

808
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
Suffering

809
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Because they're watching their loved ones

810
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
You can't take it anymore

811
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
So they think that taking their lives

812
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
Is the easiest

813
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,912
Way to go that's the only way to calm whatever it is it's going on in their mind

814
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
Because I can't explain what's going on

815
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
I'm thankful I didn't have to do that

816
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Cried when I watched

817
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
I Cry

818
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
When I watched

819
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Because I can't imagine

820
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
As a mother

821
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Sister

822
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,368
As a wife as a daughter I can't imagine

823
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,488
Watching my dad on my brothers or my uncle or my cousin

824
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
Go through life like that

825
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,864
Because both of my brothers are exhibiting signs now

826
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
That's all I can really think about is

827
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
Now what about them

828
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
Soulgazer what can you do what can they do

829
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
That's the crazy thing

830
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
You can't prepare for it

831
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
You can't

832
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
You can't stop it

833
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,576
Is absolutely nothing you can do

834
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
And still with that

835
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,232
Football every Friday night cuz my nephew

836
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm happy

837
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Now that

838
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
I can laugh at

839
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
Smile because I was completely

840
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
I I I turned into like

841
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
A vampire

842
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
When you just out of nowhere when you're just

843
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
Okay talk to you later

844
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
And then there never is a later

845
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
That that

846
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
It's a tough one

847
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Did your dad

848
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Before he died

849
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
How did your dad feel about

850
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Football how did he feel about that

851
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,072
Tte how did he feel about all of the

852
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Stuff

853
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
If you ask my father

854
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
He would tell you

855
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
I would not have changed

856
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,264
If you look at my my dad

857
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
English growing up you know

858
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
My dad

859
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,664
Was it an ear where it was separate but not

860
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
He didn't have indoor plumbing

861
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,808
She had to drink from a colored only water fountain

862
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:25,184
I didn't tell you he's a man I ain't never had a dress code once I got to know that feel like what is this

863
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
My throat

864
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
You know

865
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Sol Bean

866
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,120
Being smart and black wasn't enough

867
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,960
If you would have been black and didn't play football even as smart as my father was

868
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Where would that if

869
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
You know what have gotten him to

870
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:45,664
Two dinners at the White House would have gotten him the private chat would have gotten him

871
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
You know the house

872
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Private school education and all that

873
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
Would being a smart black guy

874
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,648
In the early forties in the forties would that have

875
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
What would I have done

876
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
She was able to

877
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
To build a life

878
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,816
Playing for the Detroit Lions is owned by the 4th

879
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Family

880
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,448
And then being able to go and internet Ford you know in the offseason

881
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
And then opening up a Ford dealership

882
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,592
And then from there branching out to what 14 new car franchises

883
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
But she left with with all of us

884
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
To be able to carry on that Legacy

885
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,040
It won't be in for in vain

886
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
We have started a foundation with

887
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,952
Building on it little by little just trying to figure out

888
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,024
Where and what Avenues we want

889
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,584
It going we know education is huge

890
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
And you know that would just want to bring awareness especially to mothers who put their young children and

891
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
As I did

892
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Just to be aware

893
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Of what

894
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
The dangers are

895
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,456
Are you willing to sign up for that

896
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,296
So now I'm going to I'm really thinking of

897
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Tricking Park

898
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
But however he

899
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
She is his Middle School mascot

900
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
Oh really well I guess I was the mascot of my high school what what is here cuz I was

901
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Griffy the Griffin

902
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,384
Give her curves the alligator I forgot the alligators name

903
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
But he's the alligator

904
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
How did you like being the alligator he loves it

905
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
He has like a costume that he wears

906
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
He wears the entire furry

907
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Head every

908
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
Turn in

909
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
To some kids

910
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Who is this kid

911
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,656
He he he starts dabbing and Mikey's this other kid

912
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
It's so my husband the first thing my husband says

913
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
He's like the mascots they still get a ring right

914
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,407
So now I'm like

915
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
We're going to keep you in Mascot Chisholm

916
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Whatever it's called

917
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Because their scholarship

00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
The young black guy because he was smart

960
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Not because of football

961
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
So what I'd love to see my son in the football jersey

962
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Sure

963
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
But am I

964
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
Surreal to see him in the alligator outfit

As

972
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711

977
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,231
To do you would go to radiolab.org

/ donate

979
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,399
Or even easier you could text the word Radiolab to the number 69866

980
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
To get started

981
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,775
A little form pops up Robert and you can donate in a matter of seconds

982
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,591
And then you can go back to thinking how

983
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
Awesome radio labs

984
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
First

985
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,807
Spin-off was two more perfect world that's going to be coming up in 2017

986
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
Cuban listen to us through this past year

987
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:19,231
I noticed and your joint of the whole lot of people that we never heard from before

988
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,071
Became blisters to something we called more perfect

989
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,631
It just show about the Supreme Court of the United

990
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Red States

991
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,775
That we thought of it because we thought the Supreme Court was going to be interesting and now of course

992
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
2017 yeah we were right

993
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
In space

994
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,687
Because what's going to happen next year is got to be

995
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:42,527
Dispute that will be near the center of a lot of conversations

996
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
A lot of people

997
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
2017 so this

998
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
More perfect show is coming back in the spring

999
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
2017

1000
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:55,071
More episodes and so people who want to hear it again it's coming

1001
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,447
Listener support is a critical component of more perfect it's a critical component of Radiolab

1002
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Any amount that you can give

1003
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Just make a gift any amount

1004
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,335
Make a gift and show

1005
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
That you understand that this is the

1006
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,783
The time to get a year-end tax deductible

1007
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
Matter in a year

1008
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,183
So yeah we like to join us both because you want to and just because of thinking

1009
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
Should right now if you know what I mean

1010
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,631
Next Robert a story that captures that Spirit of doing for others

1011
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
In a way that few

1012
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:37,311
Hi my name is Tracy hunt I'm reporter here at videolab and I wanted to talk to someone who has a very different

1013
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Relationship with giving lacera

1014
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
Hello Sarah Gray

1015
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Oh hey there you are

1016
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
How are you I'm good I'm still good

1017
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,807
Sarah was the star of the show that we did a little while back called Grace donation

1018
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
I guess I'm like a little bit nerd famous now

1019
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,327
Will just nerds know who I am you don't need to listen to Radiolab

1020
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Just a quick recap

1021
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
Sarah

1022
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,959
Tell the story about how she was pregnant with twins

1023
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Thomas and Callum

1024
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
And something was wrong with Thomas

1025
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
Doctors told her that he had anencephaly

1026
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Being bored

1027
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
He said he could see that

1028
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,967
Because one of the twins had a round skull

1029
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
And the other one had a bumpy skull

1030
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,415
She ended up giving birth to both of them and Tom aside six days later

1031
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,023
The Washington Regional transplant Community they sent a van over to our house

1032
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,095
He picked up his body and took him to

1033
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
DC

1034
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
Children's National Medical Center

1035
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
So the story was about how Sarah ended up going on this journey trying to find out what happened to all the bits in

1036
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
Pieces of Thomas that were donated so she talked about for example going to Duke University where they were using cord blood from her

1037
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
Twins and they're actually researching the disease that killed Thomas anencephaly and going to University of Pennsylvania

1038
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,583
Talking to women there who was studying this I cancer that mostly affects children call retina

1039
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,911
Blastoma eventually sarin Ross visited Aruba's lab

1040
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
She gave them a tour

1041
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
And she showed them Thomas's retina

1042
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
She still has

1043
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
Samples of it in her

1044
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Freezer

1045
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
Tiny little

1046
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,919
I don't know tiny little vials maybe you

1047
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,479
Third the size of your pinky filled with frozen liquid

1048
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Liquefied

1049
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,855
Right now it didn't look like much but it was amazing to think of how many

1050
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
People were involved

1051
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
Getting the samples there

1052
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Like we had to

1053
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,327
Approve it we had to fill out this paperwork done the doctor had to come and remove the eyes and I had to be process

1054
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
If not I have to be

1055
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
Shipped up there that they have to

1056
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
Do whatever DNA process they do in

1057
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
I don't know valuable

1058
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Maybe even priceless

1059
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
The simplest

1060
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,943
Since the show came out she released a new book called A Life Everlasting

1061
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
And I just really wanted to get on the phone with her and just talked about what the impact of the show has been and what's

1062
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
Going on with her life

1063
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
And one of the first things I found out was that she had a new baby

1064
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
Yes we have a baby girl that she was just born in June congratulation thank you

1065
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
He's doing great

1066
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
This is Thomas's brother

1067
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
He can now read a little bit

1068
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
The first grade

1069
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
And he's liking his

1070
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Sister

1071
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
What what have you told him about Thomas

1072
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
So he knows that he had a brother

1073
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,271
I was a twin who had a very very very bad boo-boo on his head

1074
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
Yeah and that's why he died

1075
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
Let me just explain you know

1076
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,463
Sometimes kids die that's just part of life

1077
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
People in other cat diseases just like grown ups

1078
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
And it's okay to die

1079
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
Does he ask you questions about Thomas

1080
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
Can we visit the grave maybe one or two times

1081
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
The year and

1082
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,495
When he was younger he asked

1083
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
Is Thomas scared under the stone

1084
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,615
So when he was probably maybe two or three

1085
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
Questions like that were hard cuz

1086
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
You know I don't

1087
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
Explain the afterlife I don't understand

1088
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Myself

1089
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,319
Yeah so I just told him no he's not scared

1090
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,159
You know he stinks of Thomas's being in heaven

1091
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,255
But he also asked me it'll can you tell me what is it like in heaven

1092
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
I said

1093
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
You know it's really like her

1094
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
Wringing my hands are cold what do I say

1095
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
Well you know some people think it's a place you go when you die

1096
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
Some people think it's got clouds and

1097
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
McCallum just goes up

1098
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
You look it up on your phone

1099
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,455
What you wanted a picture

1100
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
IPhone

1101
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,135
Do you know this way to be real but be real but this is what people think you show me a picture of God

1102
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:41,279
You know stuff like that but you know sometimes it's hard and then sometimes it's easy

1103
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
And also since the show Sarah has kept on donating in fact when her daughter Jocelyn was born

1104
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Born

1105
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,031
I was inspired to donate

1106
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
Placenta and the umbilical cord

1107
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
It was turned into four different

1108
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Skin grafts that are good

1109
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Used

1110
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
And surgeries

1111
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
For burn survivors

1112
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,295
And also the umbilical cord blood went

1113
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
To research

1114
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
But also she's been inspired to track down the people who have donated things to her

1115
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Idea

1116
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
For checking.

1117
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:19,167
Blood donors when she was in the hospital with the twins she actually had a traumatic delivery she lost half of her

1118
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,287
Blood and she ended up getting a transfusion from 11 different blood donors

1119
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,359
So I emailed the blood bank and I've met with them

1120
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
And they have sent out a thank-you letter from me

1121
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:35,807
To those 11 people and when Sarah was in the hospital with Jocelyn Jocelyn actually got some donated breast milk

1122
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,855
And I ended up saving the bottle

1123
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Actually framed it like you do

1124
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Just tears me up to think of

1125
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
Strangers donating

1126
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
Yeah

1127
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
But you know the breastmilk place

1128
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
And I said this is my donor ID for the breast milk

1129
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,167
Can you tell me who who are the people that donated this milk can I see

1130
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
Tell him thank you and this is all kind of

1131
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,519
Like I know I sound like a donation weirdo but

1132
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,335
You don't think you receive and you give them

1133
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,663
I think it's neat to make the connection find out how that really work

1134
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:08,575
Since we've recorded the episode with you have you heard me like anything new come out of the research using your sons

1135
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Tissues

1136
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
So there's a study that came out

1137
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,255
On tissue that could be my son's cornea this lab in Boston

1138
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:21,887
They've been studying corneal blindness because when your corneas are damaged those cells

1139
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,215
Would you lose them that they're never coming back they don't regenerate their just

1140
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Dad

1141
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
Have corneal blindness

1142
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:32,639
And so they're trying to figure out ways to regenerate them so corneal cells

1143
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
And they wounded them

1144
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,503
And then added umbilical cord blood to those cells

1145
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
And they found some

1146
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,599
Early-stage steps to show that these

1147
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
Corneal cells might be able to regenerate with stem cells which I believe is

1148
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,743
Kind of weather getting out of the possible

1149
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Stem cell eye drops

1150
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Deer Vision back

1151
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Oh wow

1152
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,167
So this is like way way way it's the beginning of

1153
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,495
You know what if situation and what if we could make eye drops like

1154
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
You talk like that the research

1155
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,687
How often you do whatever I feel like it does it feel like you're kind of

1156
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Lake kind of

1157
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
Continue in your relationship with Thomas in some way by by checking on these things I don't I don't know what you call it

1158
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
I feel like Thomas

1159
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
You don't he lived

1160
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
And he died and he made this

1161
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Contribution

1162
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,655
And I'm like a spectator kind of

1163
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,935
Watching

1164
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
How is contribution is

1165
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
Affecting other people

1166
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
Yeah and I'm

1167
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
I'm more like learning from him

1168
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
Then having a relationship

1169
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Abraham Butler

1170
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,575
Yeah yeah yeah I'm not sure that relationship is the right word I was just trying to like

1171
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
It's almost

1172
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,975
I don't know I I don't want to say like it it's like he still there and nothing like that I just

1173
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
You know like he's

1174
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,071
I can still very much a part of

1175
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Your life

1176
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
In some way

1177
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
Yeah he's still relevant yeah

1178
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,215
New Life did not just affect my fan

1179
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
Is life affected

1180
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:09,919
Many other people and in fact Sarah told me that eight months after the show came out she heard from the

1181
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
Miss couple in California

1182
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,015
In California they had twins

1183
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
And unfortunately one of them died

1184
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Unexpectedly

1185
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
And I believe they ask

1186
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,671
Could they donate and groupset

1187
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,999
You can't donate for transplant cuz your child is too small

1188
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,327
And if it will be her Radiolab can we donate to research

1189
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
And they said

1190
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Yes

1191
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:35,007
And their daughter was able to donate eight different tissues to eight different studies

1192
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
Yeah and in fact the retinas

1193
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,895
Went to the same

1194
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
Lab in the same researcher

1195
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
That received my son's retina

1196
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
LOL

1197
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,647
I know the other weird thing is that they're twins were born on the exact same day as my twins

1198
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Pets

1199
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
Bethel Park

1200
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
I'm really I'm really kind of speechless of that

1201
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Now that happens

1202
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,679
It is for me it was bring back so you know when my child died

1203
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Cilic

1204
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
Google control

1205
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,823
But being able to donate gave me a sense of control

1206
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
Back that you know at least this is

1207
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
This is one thing I can

1208
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
In control

1209
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Great

1210
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
So I was glad that it had that

1211
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
Impression hot.

1212
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
Sarah talking to me about

1213
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
Trying to regain a sense of control

1214
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,999
In the face of

1215
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,535
Unimaginable grief

1216
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,375
Remind me of something else she said at the end of Grace donation

1217
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Are you stupid

1218
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
Like the universe

1219
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Treated people the way it should

1220
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
And now I don't really believe that

1221
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
But I'm

1222
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
I do believe that

1223
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
There are

1224
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,431
Really amazing

1225
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
Kind people

1226
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
In the world

1227
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
And

1228
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Science and medicine has something to

1229
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
I started feeling that

1230
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Thomas his colleagues

1231
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Endoscope

1232
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
And that he was a valuable partner

1233
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
In the

1234
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
Important research that was being done

1235
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
Can I feel 10 even more fundamental shift almost like I had felt like I was a boat on an ocean that was like

1236
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Rocky and choppy with waves

1237
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,639
Can I have this feeling that I am not the boat on the ocean

1238
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Like

1239
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
The decisions that I make

1240
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Are changing other people

1241
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,367
I'm supposed to just I'm about getting slapped with Waze all the time

1242
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,023
Pets make me feel

1243
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,167
Purple

1244
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,943
Sarah gray speaking with Radiolab Tracy hunt

1245
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:57,343
I think that really is a perfect way to wrap up some of these catch up stories that we've been doing during this

1246
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,415
Episode of Radiolab stories that really have impacted

1247
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,487
The Radiolab crew and you are listeners

1248
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,535
And make sure I'm ready I'm just

1249
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
I want to thank you for just

1250
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,655
Happening here at Jad will be back in January

1251
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Open Wunderlist

1252
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
It's been more than that it's been like cozy

1253
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Yasso

1254
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,615
Someone say repetitive not me but it's not me

1255
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
How to say cozy

1256
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
I would like to thank all the people who been pooping ice but you done

1257
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,879
Something during this time and if you haven't done that something

1258
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,951
What they say one more time what the doors must have

1259
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,023
Done yes indeed

1260
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,423
Well and if you haven't that's okay too this is the time to do it it's the season of giving and the moment is here

1261
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:48,287
You've heard how people can act and give to each other on this episode and big and small ways

1262
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,895
And we hope you're inspired and that you make a gift in whatever amount works

1263
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
For you

/ donate to give

1266
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
And there's also a text option as well you to text the word Radiolab to 69866

1267
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,119
I get you started and you'll be able to complete your donation in a matter of I would just a sec
