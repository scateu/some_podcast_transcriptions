Spell people

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
That Chad last year produced with amazing team a spin-off from Radiolab it is as it is

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
888 series about the law the law of the Supreme Court of the United States

9
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,056
Court in the land yet the idea was to take

10
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,408
To take the Radiolab thing the way of looking the way seen the way sounding producing

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Flight to

12
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
Bizarre opaque

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
Body

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
Of Robin

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,904
Figures Robitussin people who wear black robes romad

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,024
You guys not English weird but isn't but I know it's an Old English word actually it's actually sort of tea

17
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,840
Common-law words they used to

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:13,984
Buspar robe snowed so that the show is called more perfect the idea behind it is could we tell

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
Personal

20
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Human

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Surprising

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,224
Thought-provoking stories about not just the justices with the people in the ideas to get

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
In front of the court

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,880
In the process can we give ourselves a new way of thinking about this country though that was the idea

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Was pretty well too I thought it was alright the first season which was enormously popular I think was

26
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,912
Enormously popular because these as you call them aroubd people that you're going to Black

27
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Pulsing Hearts you know they would sit down and Blake's by themselves and go crazy with concern they would have thought they were

28
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Throbbing Heart full

29
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Nutty

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Passionate

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Angry

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,808
They are beautiful people I was really quite something. Thank you

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
Okay so now what Robert I would love to play you the first episode

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
The very first episode of season

35
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
And one of the central ideas of the Season were perfect is that that

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Did these moments in history that we thought were gone

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
They're never really gone

38
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,984
They will always swing back into the now and one of the cases

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
It is very much swinging back into the now is it

40
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Watch movie Split

41
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
As you're listening know that there are already a couple more extra episodes already in the more perfect feed Radiolab

00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
. org / more perfect or

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Okay here it is

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Episode number 1 season 2

46
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
In February of 2017

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,704
Said something that surprised a lot of people would say Italy or not

49
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Experiencing the best of times

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
She stepped

51
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,432
Straight into the political Fray and addressed this political moment

52
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
A1 said

53
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Did the

54
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
True symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle it is the pendulum

55
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,584
And when the pendulum swings too far in One Direction it will go back

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Some terrible things have happened in the United States but

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Lincoln only

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Hope that we learn from those bad thing

59
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,248
Today we're going to ride the pendulum to the dark side

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
Start with one of the most infamous decisions the court has ever made

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Korematsu decision you might imagine it's not going to be the happiest of situations but

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Story that we're going to tell you today and tomorrow as well actually

63
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
They're not stories of bitterness

64
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
Because this curious thing happens in both cases

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,872
Characters can't find Justice inside the Supreme Court

66
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Stop looking for it there

67
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
And if I did somewhere else entirely

68
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,624
Producer Julia Longoria start this off

69
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,119
The year is 1967 and the place

70
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Is San Lorenzo High School in East Bay of California

71
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
And we're in a

72
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
U.s. history classroom I was actually a junior in high school this is Karen korematsu

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,831
I'm the executive director and founder of the Fred T korematsu Institute in San Francisco

74
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
So on this particular day

75
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,255
Karen is sitting at the back of the classroom and our teacher had assigned each of

76
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
My classmates a little paperback

77
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,191
Book to read you know books about American history government in the assignment was to

78
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
Then I get up in front of the class and give an oral book report to me this is a long time ago so that's the way they used to do

79
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Do things

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
I don't even remember what my my book was are my subject but Karen said she was just sitting there in class listen

81
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
As one by one classmate Scott up

82
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,695
Talk about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or whatever and then my friend

83
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
Maya who is Japanese-American 3rd Generation like myself got up in front of the class

84
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
And her book was called concentration camps USA

85
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
About the Japanese-American internment

86
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
And I thought

87
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
No that's

88
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
Interesting I hadn't heard about that before what's that about

89
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
My book report went something like this

90
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
In 1941 the United States of America with attached

91
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
And the president's President Roosevelt had to respond

92
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
All measures be taken broadband

93
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
So in terms of Defense

94
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,823
One of the big questions for Roosevelt was what happens if the Japanese invade the continental US

95
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
America's founding

96
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
They probably come in on the West Coast

97
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
And you had more than a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast

98
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Like what they turn against the United States

99
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
They didn't know

100
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:26,815
And so her friend my explained to the class on February 19th 1942

101
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
President Roosevelt issued executive order 90066

102
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
That gave the military the authority

103
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:40,639
To forcibly remove anyone of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast

104
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
She goes on to explain these the horrific circumstances and

105
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
How you a hundred twenty thousand people of Japanese ancestry had been real forcibly

106
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Removed from their homes

107
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
She explained they were put into these

108
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
Detention camps really without any due process of law but then she went on to say but there was this one

109
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
One man

110
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Who refused to go to the camps and

111
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
He was arrested and sue the government

112
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,199
And took his case all the way to the Supreme Court and then he became a landmark Supreme Court case

113
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
And that man's name

114
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
Is Fred korematsu

115
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
I said to myself

116
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
That's my name

117
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
She says the class got really quiet

118
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
And I had 35 pairs of eyes turn around looking at me okay yes she thought my last

119
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
Name is karma to my dad's name is Fred but no way

120
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
There's no way it's my dad someone would have told me

121
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
So

122
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Corson I go running home and

123
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Confronting my mother and asking her

124
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
What she say

125
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,903
Well I got the standard to answer wait till your father gets home and you can ask him

126
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,767
My voice you heard by the way was Elie mystal our legal editor by the time he

127
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:06,911
I got home it was 8 in the evening and so that's a long time after you know 3:30 in the afternoon

128
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,007
And I calm down a little bit and I asked him in and he said

129
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
It happened a long time ago

130
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
And what he did he thought was right

131
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
And the government was wrong

132
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
And it was at clear and simple

133
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
I could just see

134
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
This hurt

135
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
Going over his face and I just couldn't ask him

136
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Any more questions

137
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,839
Karen says it wasn't until years later that she learned what really happened

138
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
And why her dad never wanted to talk

139
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Well

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
I was 21 then

141
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
This is

142
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
Fred korematsu at stapleton from the densho archives

143
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
And I was up on the hill

144
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Sunday morning

145
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
My girlfriend

146
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
And Fred story starts

147
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,207
Out on a date when you're that age you know you have a girlfriend just like anybody else

148
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,047
And she was more important to me than anything

149
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,679
Fred and his girlfriend Ida are driving in the Hills above San Francisco looking down on the city

150
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,543
The Golden Gate Bridge you've been dating this girl for a while now

151
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,151
Italian-American most of his friends were Caucasian

152
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
And we were deciding what to do with such a nice day

153
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
Is it Go picnicking or something like that

154
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
And then all sudden diarrhea

155
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
We interrupt this program to bring you

156
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,839
Pokemon are newer car radio

157
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
Cloud right now

158
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Japanese Embassy

159
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
And I was quite shocked we both were

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,175
Fred knew there was a war on and that the US was likely to get involved

161
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,063
Even try to enlist in the US military but was denied because he was Japanese-American

162
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
This is sitting there one of his first thoughts was

163
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
Why does it have to be Japan

164
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
Some country was going to attack Pearl Harbor

165
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
I wish it was Russia

166
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
You know

167
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
I just thought about that

168
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
I was bitter with the pan-fried having this happen

169
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
So I took her home

170
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
And then I went home

171
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
So

172
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
He gets home

173
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Central shock

174
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
They're all sitting around the living room

175
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
The house is just in the spare his mom is in tears they were proud of being Japanese

176
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
You know they obey the law

177
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
They did everything that supposed to mean

178
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
To have this happen

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
I put them in chain

180
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
It was even hard to talk to them after that

181
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
Fred had a traditional immigrant Japanese American family

182
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California

183
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,159
He was the third out of four brothers and being the 3rd not the 2nd or the 1st

184
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
That matter

185
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Absolutely

186
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
Fred wasn't unique position as the third

187
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Son he could resist

188
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,447
We asked Lorraine Vani I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts

189
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son

190
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business

191
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
II would help out with that business

192
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
Brad as a third son was very low on the totem pole is parents and have the same expectations

193
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Love him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook

194
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,119
Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else

195
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,471
When I was in school we started each day for the Pledge of Allegiance

196
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
I studied American history

197
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Always been a good American citizen

198
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked

199
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Is family's response to the whole thing was

200
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Unsettling

201
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
I am

202
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
I didn't know what to do

203
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
And Fred says pretty soon after

204
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Things got very weird

205
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,511
Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night

206
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
And they had a guard standing right now

207
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Our home there around the fence there watching us

208
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
Cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was staying on the park tonight

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
But a cigarette

210
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
And God y'all. If I was singling somebody

211
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Ridiculous

212
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Then came Roosevelt executive order

213
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
That big order 906 6

214
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones

215
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
The first set of orders was a curfew order

216
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Saying that Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew the second order was a freeze order

217
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
Directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast

218
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,287
They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order

219
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Wasn't order that they could not

220
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
We met

221
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
On the West Coast

222
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army

223
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
They're about 15 of these assembly centers

224
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date

225
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,471
Fred's family began to scramble to worry about what they were going to take what was going to happen to the nursery

226
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
And so expecting my mother you know the tension and worries

227
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
For his family left

228
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Fred made a decision

229
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
Me being the third son you know

230
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
I am I had my own worries

231
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
I had mom girlfriend my own problems

232
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
He decided not to go with his family

233
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Talk to them bedtime

234
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
That I don't want to

235
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
I won't be with you

236
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
You didn't want to leave item behind

237
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,543
I thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on leave the state

238
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Before the evacuation deadline

239
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
And

240
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
They said fine if you can do it

241
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Go ahead

242
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
She was the third son

243
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
So he knew that

244
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
His older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was a grown-up and he should make his own

245
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Sessions

246
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,095
And so he did he went off and got his own apartment

247
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
His own job as a welder

248
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
I'm kind of lived under the radar

249
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
Lewis Brothers would be there to take care of his parents if you're with a family like my family or any

250
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
A Japanese family

251
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
You feel the pressure in the

252
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Sadness

253
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
But on the outside is different just like a normal

254
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
What if you know

255
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
Just like we've been living all the time

256
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
I felt right at home

257
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
You know I'm an American citizen to you know

258
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
I didn't feel guilty

259
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong

260
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,735
Sense of humor politically aware at this point

261
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
If you're asking me about whether he

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
Refuse to go as an act of political resistance

263
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
I don't think initially

264
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
Unconsciously he probably

265
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,815
New that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong

266
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today

267
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,103
Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper about his parents

268
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
And all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp

269
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,783
Baby's sick to my stomach and on that

270
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
I can see my parents going in Yunnan my brothers

271
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Going to camp

272
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
And I'm not there you know

273
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:04,351
But that was the only time that I felt

274
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
Kind of lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know

275
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,127
It begins to slowly down on him what he's done

276
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,223
By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law

277
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,599
And he and I aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse

278
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
He talks in the archives about how he's worried

279
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
And I was worried to

280
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Because now he could get arrested

281
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
So they start to think about their options Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized

282
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Nice to Japanese

283
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
And then I decided

284
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Essentially that might not be enough

285
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
Chapul. An article

286
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
We're going to plastic surgery

287
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
And

288
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
What do you think of this

289
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
I looked it over

290
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
And well

291
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
I didn't

292
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,463
Think I was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about

293
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,071
That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here

294
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
So the idea would be that he

295
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that a plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the eye

296
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Eyelid

297
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,919
So you look more white less Japanese-American

298
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
And I guess I don't know

299
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Well

300
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
She said she'll be looking to it

301
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
And

302
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Why is it that I'm going to lose so we decide to try it

303
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,727
So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he

304
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
Just stops in front of the doctor's office

305
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Amsart spacing

306
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then

307
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then

308
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Walking back up the steps

309
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,511
Thinking well yeah maybe I was right it's a good idea and the down the steps

310
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
This is a ridiculous idea giving some doctor your hard-earned money to

311
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Change your face

312
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
So it goes up

313
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
And down

314
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
And I

315
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Down and up

316
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
Down until

317
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
He decided to just

318
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Going

319
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
And have the procedure done

320
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
He really did it as a way to

321
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
Protect them as they try to leave the state

322
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix

323
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Broken nose I had a broken nose

324
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
I'm playing football in the never had it fixed

325
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
And

326
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
So you could do a pretty good work on me

327
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would

328
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Regis

329
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
Took my money that's what it was

330
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Actually

331
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
There wasn't anything change except

332
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
I didn't have a broken nose anymore

333
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,135
So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes

334
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:12,511
And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store

335
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Leclerc

336
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Recognized him

337
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Reported him

338
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,031
And one day walking down the street he was stopped and arrested

339
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
And

340
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,223
Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail

341
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
When we got caught

342
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
They called her into

343
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Yeah

344
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
And

345
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
I see the police chief

346
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Talking to her

347
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Quite a while

348
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come in to the front desk

349
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,407
He's just out of earshot he can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point

350
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
A stop talking

351
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
She just walks out

352
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
So

353
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
That was the end of it

354
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
I never did see her again

355
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
Never saw each other

356
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,991
So he sitting there alone in the San Leandro jail

357
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
And they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at

358
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Federal

359
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
Prison in San Francisco because resisting the order was a federal offense

360
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Anyway

361
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
One day I got to

362
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Call from the guard

363
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,703
And tell me I had a visitor

364
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
And I didn't know it was you know

365
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but Fred Goes Down to the visiting room anyway

366
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
And

367
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,551
There's this man there New Yorker

368
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Well I believe in civil liberties

369
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
Right of people

370
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
Is being denied

371
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
This is something that i'm concerned about the man says his name is ernest besig

372
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Very nice phone

373
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Easier to talk to me

374
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
He asked if I needed some cigarettes or something like that too

375
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Just to break the ice

376
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
By the way I asked him

377
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Who do you represent

378
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
And Earnest response well

379
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
ACLU or something like that

380
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest best

381
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
Both men have passed away

382
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,472
But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because

383
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,848
If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words for that we might have today

384
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Fred didn't have

385
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
Language of resistance before this moment

386
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,808
Something in that conversation must have given it to him

387
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
Because when Earnest Pathak asked him

388
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Do you want

389
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Me to represent you in a court of law

390
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Fred says

391
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Yes

392
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
What do you mention the words worth it

393
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
Might have turned him in that moment

394
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
Imagine

395
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
That

396
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Message must have said to fraud

397
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
We think that what's happened to Japanese Americans

398
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
Is unconstitutional

399
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
We'd like to bring a lawsuit

400
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
To say the Japanese Americans

401
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
Are being sent away

402
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
Only because of their race

403
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
And in that

404
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Gay pride language

405
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
For what I think Fred knew was wrong

406
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had

407
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
Had to join his family and camp

408
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks

409
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
It was a temporary holding spot

410
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,400
So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was

411
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
A converted horse stall

412
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Alpha adorned in their gapping holes on the walls the wind just blew in there in the dust

413
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Blue in there and everything

414
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,224
And this was a small horse dog because Fred had asked for his own

415
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,808
Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family

416
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,672
We're also at Tanforan sat and looked at the single loan

417
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,280
Bear light bulb above and the smell of manure and hay

418
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
How many spray for horses not for human beings

419
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door

420
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
And I'll open it with my brother

421
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Is hey you can't stay here you

422
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
You got coming

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Cedar Park

424
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,440
Walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living

425
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,560
And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stalls

426
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
The

427
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Solar panel cracks

428
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,776
And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up

429
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
This was a common thing for these families

430
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:52,224
Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years

431
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
Overtime

432
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
The community

433
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,648
Kind of tried to build lives for themselves

434
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
You hear stories

435
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
MC pictures

436
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
People building small Japanese gardens

437
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Out of

438
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
What they found in the area

439
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,008
She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom

440
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Eventually saw

441
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
People forming you know baseball teams

442
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,432
My brother has he was involved in various Japanese activities

443
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
And

444
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
He thought it might be a good idea for me to

445
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,696
Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to

446
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
If I should fight the case or not

447
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
So Fred's brother calls a meeting

448
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
He got about 30 young people together

449
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,008
Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that

450
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
And they discussed Frets case

451
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
They were

452
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
Discussion into themselves or in little groups

453
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,296
And I stood around and I waited for someone to speak

454
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
But no one actually came out to speak to me

455
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
I can see Fred

456
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,336
Can I standing in the corner as people are gathered in small groups

457
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Whispering to each other

458
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Stealing glances at him

459
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
But no one says a word to him

460
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,728
Finding one dead and You Said Fred.

461
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
We're undecided on

462
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
If I should buy

463
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Acacia not because

464
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
They don't want to

465
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Make any more disturbance

466
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Anything to upset

467
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,880
The parents right at the time because they were too upset already and think

468
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Just being in Camp

469
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,232
They told him their parents have been through enough

470
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Leaving their lives behind

471
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Basically they said we can't help you

472
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:00,128
But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case

473
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
What's the name of the group

474
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
Jacl

475
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,784
Ernest bethak had a nickname for this group

476
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,368
The Japanese-American Citizens League

477
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
I meant

478
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
With a leadership of that group

479
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Several of them

480
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
I purged them

481
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
To oppose

482
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
The explosion

483
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,448
But they didn't seem to be particularly interested

484
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,264
The JCL condemned Frets case

485
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
And anyone else who fought against the government orders

486
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,176
Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders

487
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
And called them

488
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Self-styled martyrs

489
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Wow

490
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
They use that phrase

491
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Yes

492
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
They would basically

493
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
Get everyone else into trouble

494
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
To do this by myself

495
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
I just wonder if I was doing wrong or

496
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
I'll maybe putting them in Shame by

497
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
I'm bringing the issue up again

498
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful

499
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,336
People when they they like to leave things alone if they can

500
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Because

501
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,968
They were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack

502
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,272
And the country blame them

503
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
So they have the sort of a guilty complex

504
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Even though

505
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
They have nothing to do with it

506
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,376
Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that

507
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
That

508
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
I got myself in this problem

509
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
And

510
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
That was my problem in the end not there

511
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
Reddit continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up

512
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process

513
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,960
Basically amounted to racial discrimination

514
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually

515
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,920
Two-and-a-half years after he met an asbestos in that jail cell

516
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
The case arrives

517
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,504
At the Supreme Court

518
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,832
Yo he thought that by the time his case got to the

519
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Supreme Court

520
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
That's Fred's daughter Karen again he would

521
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,000
Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated

522
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court

523
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
And so when that didn't happen he felt like

524
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
If he felt like it was his fault

525
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
It's a big burden to carry around

526
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
What ends up happening is

527
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
On December 18th 1944

528
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,064
The Supreme Court ruled against Fred

529
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
It's kind of a complicated decision

530
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
The Supreme Court

531
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Said

532
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Racial distinctions

533
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
When the government is making racial distinction

534
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
It's serious

535
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,864
We need to look at this very very carefully

536
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
And that was a big president

537
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Sun a lot of ways

538
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
It's

539
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Kind of

540
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
Victory for people fighting racial discrimination

541
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
But then the court turned around and said

542
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
Even though racial distinctions are serious

543
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
This one

544
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Is not

545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Strictly racial

546
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:26,208
We are at war with the Japanese Empire Fair for rounding up Japanese-American Citizens

547
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Is a way to

548
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
Defend the nation

549
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
How's your friend at this point

550
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're

551
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
You're by yourself

552
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Pretty-much on all fronts

553
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:47,712
The country that you feel so part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for

554
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
Doesn't seem to want you at that moment

555
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Your own Community doesn't seem to want you

556
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Your family

557
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
It's a Shame by you

558
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Your girlfriend

559
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Is gone

560
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
I can't imagine being more alone at this

561
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Point

562
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
Any never shared that with my brother I

563
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
He shared it with my mother but

564
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
But we didn't that wasn't part of our pentateuch conversation

565
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
You know

566
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,568
What is

567
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,176
This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision

568
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
It is

569
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
Still on the books

570
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,088
That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and

571
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,464
Said this stuff about korematsu and the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that

572
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
But he's right

573
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Korematsu is technically still good law

574
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Justice Antonin Scalia

575
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
One said

576
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided

577
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
But if you think that it's not going to happen again

578
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
You're kidding yourself

579
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
The courtesan

580
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
Isn't it across the president

581
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
CNN International

582
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Would you like it to

583
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
I think so

584
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Would you like it to

585
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
No

586
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,512
That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner

587
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,840
Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court

588
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Appeals

589
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:47,008
He was widely considered by people on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country

590
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,824
He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice

591
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
And he's a big Defender

592
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
At the korematsu decision

593
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:59,296
What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about

594
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Kind of the law and the court

595
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Well they were given compensation

596
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Right I mean Thursday Thursday

597
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
There is no pain

598
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
There there's an anguish right that we can

599
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Exactly commodify

600
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
Yeah but

601
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
At the time it all happened

602
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
Shortly after Pearl Harbor

603
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,224
It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right

604
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,064
And I imagine that the officials

605
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
Federal government in

606
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
1941

607
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
They probably

608
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,560
Didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast

609
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:48,448
Roosevelt ever compared to Japanese-American I doubt it

610
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
The fact that he had never met anybody

611
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,640
I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now

612
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,712
No because all he cares about is

613
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Defense of the United States

614
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
If there's any

615
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,184
Possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invasion Force

616
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
That he has to

617
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Move the Japanese

618
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
What's this

619
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
I'm sure that's all he would have thought of

620
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
I think it's all he did think of

621
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
But what else could you have thought of

622
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
That's the only thing

623
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
He is going to focus on

624
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
And if he doesn't he could be impeached

625
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Or he could also

626
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,344
Worried about citizens right I think one of the look you're not you

627
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,952
You're missing the priorities the priority is defense

628
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about

629
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,864
You think they have time to be thinking about any

630
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Any

631
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,216
Kind of nice ideas for protecting people

632
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Any more than

633
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Lincoln did

634
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate and

635
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Jail without due process

636
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,600
And then Justified it by saying he had to save the Union

637
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Nikes

638
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him

639
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,304
Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this

640
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
Jerk should be released

641
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice

642
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
No you do that enough time

643
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
As the president you're out

644
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
It seems to me that

645
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
That's why we have court

646
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,480
We have no, that is not why we have

647
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
We do not have cords

648
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,344
So that presidents can be checked

649
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,440
In situations of a national emergency

650
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
That was my courts were set up

651
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
Then what I mean

652
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
I'm flailing now but

653
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Then what stops then what

654
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
If Court

655
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,176
Congress can't stop a man that's the courts can't stop them like what can stop a president in a time of War

656
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
There's nobody that nobody can check

657
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
The president's responsibilities

658
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Obviously I'd like a do-over

659
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
Because somehow In the Heat of the Moment

660
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
I forgot

661
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
That

662
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:28,192
I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizens

663
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
And Posner is talking about

664
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
People who are Rebels

665
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
To touch

666
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,384
There is probably a way where I could have said

667
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
Pointed that out to him

668
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,552
Friends of the Court stepping in I mean it happens it happened to Truman

669
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
But you know judge Posner is right

670
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
But it doesn't happen a lot

671
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,256
Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check Wikipedia

672
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,656
And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices are great big brains

673
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
Pink Stars

674
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,544
Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States

675
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
And their decisions are

676
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,920
Are usually great you think all that

677
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all

678
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
You look at them how they are appointed who appoints

679
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,912
This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance

680
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
To the

681
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
Present in a war

682
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
This is what gets me up at

683
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
Gets me going because

684
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
I still think it can be used as a precedent

685
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,344
So your ears you're still worried that it can be used

686
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
And that it

687
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
Do you think it will be like you don't like you know I think we cannot take this for granted

688
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
Wow that's just quieter I mean

689
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,712
That judge is as revered and as thought highly of as

690
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
As you guys said

691
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,344
Yeah you just actually think we don't mention I vote on her he will he just retired

692
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,488
Yeah he just like I think within a within the last month but you know I mean I'm listening to that and I'm thinking wow

693
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
Not only is there a distinction to be made between people who are American citizens and people who are traitors but there's also this

694
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Hugeback

695
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
If you are German Americans

696
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,360
By the tens of thousands in this country at that time

697
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
We were at war with Germany to end Germans

698
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:50,528
Held big rally in Madison Square Garden with swastikas and

699
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,112
Supported Hitler out loud and marched for him for a while wish they had it

700
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
Every right to do

701
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
But

702
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
They were not

703
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,560
Getting quite the same degree of Suspicion is the Japanese and that's a question

704
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
I think for

705
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
For the court

706
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,032
So there is an argument for justice wasn't but there's an argument against him for sure

707
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Yeah

708
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
Wow that's really

709
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
So now

710
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
Fred has to solve his problem elsewhere

711
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,320
Rights when the next part of the story the question really is like since Fred can't get Justice in the court

712
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
Can you find it on the outside

713
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
And he does in this

714
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
Place that you wouldn't expect

715
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Come back we'll find out where that place is yeah

716
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
Aries will continue in a moment with our featuring of radiolab's first-ever spin-off more perfect

And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

723
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teacher

724
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:20,896
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments childhood brilliance

725
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,296
Did something that just means you lean back and say whoa

726
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,184
Maybe it was the moment that a kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

727
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

728
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in the

729
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

730
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,455
If you have a story please share it with us

731
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:00,831
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

732
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,439
Again that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

733
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,383
Hey I'm Chad album run Radiolab we're previewing the first episode of more perfect season 2 so we

734
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,783
We go back to Fred korematsu who as you just heard lost his case before The Supreme Court did not get the REM

735
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,367
Maybe he wanted them so now he is I don't know what he's going to do

736
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:39,999
Will now end up getting a kind of Remedy you said it was something you did that it's not

737
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
Some judges involved with this this this I find really really moving

738
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
I got to say just personally

739
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
The whole reason to tell the story is where it ends

740
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
So

741
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
So pretty sure Julie Longoria is going to

742
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
Pick back up the story with

743
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
What happened to Fred after the decision

744
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
So the

745
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,831
Internment camp where Fred was staying

746
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Clothes in 1945

747
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,719
And Fred have gotten permission by that point to work

748
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
At a steel mill in Detroit

749
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
So he was living in Detroit

750
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
He fell in love with a woman named Katherine

751
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,447
They got married moved back to the Bay Area and had two kids

752
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,847
And Karen his daughter says that they were kind of ostracized from the Japanese American Community they grew up

753
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,943
Outside of the Japanese Community he was involved in Boy Scouts

754
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,575
Girl Scouts so I was a girl scout so we all the camps when we had to open the camp he would work on that

755
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,159
The Presbyterian Church in Oakland and then he became an elder

756
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,487
Even join the Lions Club and he was President twice

757
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
And Karen says throughout

758
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
The 40s

759
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
The fifties the 60s

760
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
She never heard him talk about his case

761
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
No never

762
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
No never

763
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Hit he just

764
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,567
Never he never seen ever

765
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:03,199
Tell the story even after she confronted him about it in high school yeah it's that's it

766
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,039
But she says in like 1969 ish

767
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,879
68 or 69 when the world was in a very different place

768
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,719
They got a phone call back in those days you know you my parents

769
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Phone number was in the phone book

770
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Of all things

771
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Get me my father we get phone calls from

772
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,191
Boston when it interview on but he really didn't want to talk about his case much

773
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
She just

774
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
It was just too painful

775
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,591
But this time there was a professor on the line from the University of California Berkeley

776
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
It was a Japanese guy actually

777
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
And I told Fred

778
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
I really really want you to come into my class

779
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,783
There was a ethnic studies

780
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Class that was actually off campus

781
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
Ethnic studies was not even recognize that

782
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
So he he talked

783
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,767
Yeah that this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal

784
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,095
Me UC Berkeley at that time had the snow

785
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Notorious

786
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,239
Reputation of being very radical for asking questions during the whole hour

787
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
This is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day and it was important

788
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
Different country like you have to learn up stand up to Authority and certainly these students were like DLC astounding say

789
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
Well why didn't you

790
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,719
Why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you fight harder and we're almost

791
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,559
You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think

792
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,911
You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the

793
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
Accounts

794
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,287
Many many kids had not had Frank discussions with their own Tara and so

795
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,103
Was korematsu it was probably a surrogate for like

796
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Your parents

797
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,479
How could they have gone to that and never told me they had no right not to

798
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
To tell me

799
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,039
And so they're really angry at their parents

800
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
Surrogate or not

801
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:51,487
Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never one

802
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
Want to speak to anyone again

803
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,591
Redwood ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court

804
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
And you would win

805
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
The Supreme Court decision still stands

806
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,015
But he was able to clear his own personal name

807
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647
Around 1990

808
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
Again the world in a very different place

809
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,535
He finds himself again on a college campus

810
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,095
This time the University of

811
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Michigan

812
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,447
My father and mother were walking with some other students

813
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
Across campus

814
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,591
To see the newly renovated library and

815
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
Beyond my father loved architecture was very old Gothic

816
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:47,295
Library so they're walking through this sort of open quad looking at the architecture

817
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
And then they come upon this group of students

818
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
A group of

819
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
Arab

820
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
American students

821
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,511
The student start walking toward him they

822
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,583
All of a sudden kind of surrounding my father and they had this

823
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Certificate

824
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
To give to my father

825
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
To thank him for speaking up

826
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
So that was meaningful to him

827
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,991
Why why did that make you emotional

828
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Why that story

829
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
Because it meant so much to my father

830
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:33,119
That this group really honored him

831
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
That

832
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,935
Also had been racially profiled

833
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,031
Y'all to think that he would be able to

834
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
Touch their lives it it kind of reinforced what he

835
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:53,087
He was doing

836
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:56,671
Do you have the same faith in the Constitution that your dad did that.

837
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
Have great faith

838
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
In our constitution

839
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
It is a great document

840
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
It

841
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,191
It so happened so that it's the way that certain people in

842
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Interpreted

843
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
That gets us into trouble

844
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Yes

845
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
Definitely

846
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:08,351
3.0 coming here tonight the Trump Administration on billing

847
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
New travel restrictions on certain foreign Nationals from eight countries

848
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:21,151
Is everything with a feeling we're thinking they going to start a new line in United States

849
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
This is what we want we want

850
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:40,351
We want to deliver TV1 the people we are the people

851
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:46,751
There are many many lawyers here they're all working pro bono today they're from different organization

852
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
What resistance looks like sends a message that they cannot do

853
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
Away with constitutional protections without people standing up for the Constitution so

854
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:05,951
I think this is inspirational I think it's wonderful and I think we need to be vigilant and keep fighting

855
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,327
We know it's interesting it's like not only

856
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
To the courts

857
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
You know eventually go back and forth

858
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
On these

859
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Deeper questions

860
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
So do all of us

861
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Shandong

862
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,711
The verdict of history is always going to be a little bit shifting but eventually

863
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
You kind of hope

864
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,855
At the Arkansas to move just far enough along you can't go back

865
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
You can go all the way back

866
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Eventually you get to a better place

867
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
You get a little bit more perfect

868
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,887
Nice more perfect by the way is produced by me
