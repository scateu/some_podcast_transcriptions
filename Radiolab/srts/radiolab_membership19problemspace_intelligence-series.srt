00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Pick this is G

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
I realized miniseries

40
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Episode 2

41
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Pat Walters

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592
That end in episode one we told the story of a guy who was given an IQ test

43
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
When he was a boy

44
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
And it changed the course

45
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Not for the better

46
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
His Name Was Daryl

47
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
But he came to be known as Larry.

48
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
He took on that pseudonym when he became the center of a court case

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,208
That basically put the IQ test itself on trial

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
4 months lawyers presented evidence that the test

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Daryl took were racially biased

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
And in 1979 a federal judge

53
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Band the IQ test

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
Are used on African American children

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Board making decisions about special education

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
In the state of California

57
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
That could still be given to white kids

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Hispanic kids

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Asian kid

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Just not the bike

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,368
Netgear imagine this has caused some issues test test test

62
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,952
Chapter 2 begins about 25 years later okay

63
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000

Winton Middle School Winton high school and their youngest

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
Nicholas is in kindergarten

79
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
And how did you learn about this thing

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
It was just by pure accident I picked up a stupid paper that my husband brought home from work one day because he worked for the day

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Daily Review on a job delivering papers to local businesses

82
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Take one

83
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Mainly for the sport

84
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
You got all your warriors

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Giron

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Yes

87
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Go Warriors

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,095
Anyhow one-day Ricky comes in with us an extra papers Pam grabs a piece of it

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
And she says

90
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
Article just a little tiny thing about a quart

91
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
Not the letter T case a different court case but it mentioned the Larry P case

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
And it said black kids in California can not be given IQ test

93
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,527
And I seen it and when I was reading it I was like

94
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Can't be true

95
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
In this day and age

96
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
She said she immediately thought of Nicholas

97
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,719
Didn't look Caucasian out of my kids look Caucasian you can tell their biracial

98
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Is this going to affect him like

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Are people going to be making decisions about what test he can and can't have because of the color of his skin is spark me to call the school and find

100
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
I doubt this is true

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
And he told us it was a 1968

102
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Court ruling

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
And it was true

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
Now just for the record the case was decided in 79 not 68 but whatever at that point were you thinking

105
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
I was dumbfounded

106
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,439
This ruling has lasted all these years he explained that like

107
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
The ruling band tests that were found to be biased against African-American students

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
I did not care

109
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
My son was going to have

110
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
The same rights

111
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Any other child

112
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
My wife and I we

113
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
I will just told him that's not right

114
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
After that first conversation Pam and Ricky ended up having a series of meetings with

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
The school

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,599
Some of which ended in yelling for I threatened I told him I'll go to his I'll sue you guys

117
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
And eventually after a few of these meetings

118
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
The school administrator came back to them and said

119
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
Basically look we know you're upset

120
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Here's what we can do

121
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Do you do you remember

122
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
The offer that was given to us

123
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Well you said that

124
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
Our child would be able to take that test

125
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
If we just put them down as Caucasian

126
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
That ridiculous

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,343
Offer if you Mark Nicholas down Caucasian

128
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
He will get the test

129
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
But if you choose

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Tumarkin African-American

131
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
And he will not

132
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Superintendent said you had no

133
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Mark

134
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Either or

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Bye

136
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Remember this coming up will you track down the school administrator who was on the other end of that conversation my name is

137
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,431
Dr. Blaine cohick in a different School District now

138
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
But back when he was meeting with him and Ricky he says

139
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
I was in a situation of really having to defend this ruling

140
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
He says win10 Ricky got it

141
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Said he actually called the states

142
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
School Board

143
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Askmen

144
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
What are we supposed to do about this

145
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
The

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,351
Only resolution I was given to kind of

147
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Help

148
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Was that

149
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
The parent

150
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,239
Has the right to determine what race the child is

151
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,383
I turn on looked at him I looked at my husband I look back at him I said so you want me

152
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
Didn't I

153
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
My husband

154
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Heritage

155
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
For my son to have this right

156
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
That really got

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
I

158
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Would agree

159
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,207
You know it really doesn't make a lot of sense and I I was

160
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,559
Totally pissed at this point I've had many friends tell me

161
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
That parents became irate

162
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Disappointed very upset like frustrated very upset I ended up talking to a bunch of school psychologists to work

163
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
In the California public

164
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,663
I'm James hiramoto Panabaker and they confirmed for me that situations like what happened with Pam and Ricky

165
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
They're not

166
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Baton usual

167
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Sometimes

168
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
A reaction might be

169
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
What why not

170
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Or what if I say that it's okay like as a parent can I just like sign something to prove that it's okay that

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
I don't care

172
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
I know what happens if they check African American and Caucasian

173
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
If it's marked anywhere

174
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
There is there is no nothing at talks about

175
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Percentage

176
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Have you had

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Kids you've assessed

178
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Where you thought like

179
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
Well maybe they're African-American and so just to be safe I'm going to not use my IQ test

180
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
I have

181
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
I have

182
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
That's so weird

183
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
It is

184
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
It is a very awkward situation

185
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Basic question

186
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Two two questions

187
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Refers to schools

188
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,775
Use IQ tests as much these days as they used to

189
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
Back in the Larry P days when the band was put in place

190
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,151
Not quite as much as I used to but they still use them at

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
So

192
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
I'm more than a million kids a year

193
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Forgiving the West

194
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Which is that

195
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
IQ test that we talked about all of the last episode

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
This still the most widely used IQ test

197
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Since then

198
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
Lots of other IQ tests have been made and released the Arthur point scale

199
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
Cattell horn in infant intelligence scale

200
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
Columbia Mental maturity scale all of these tests are actually banned for black kids in California still have to get salads

201
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Developmental schedule

202
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,663
Goodenough Harris drawing test Merrill Palmer preschool performance test

203
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
What happened

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Raven's Progressive matrices

205
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Have the test changed

206
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Mason a while

207
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,135
Have the places that were found to be biased

208
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Biased

209
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,815
Yeah well that question led me to

210
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Name Alan Kaufman

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Trying to park

212
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,751
I don't know what no problem

213
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Okay

214
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,383
, is driving he's a professor at the Yale medical school and he says the test

215
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Have changed

216
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
And he would know

217
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Because he was one of the first people

218
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
To start changing

219
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Victorious

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
30 + 19

221
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
68

222
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,439
I was working for the psychological Corporation in New York

223
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
City Island with a young guy at the time

224
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
I start working with a psychologist named David wax

225
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
David wechsler invented

226
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
The Whisk

227
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
The tests we talked about all last episode

228
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
David wechsler

229
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Really founder

230
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
He was like this giant in the field

231
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
And Allen this 20-something nobody

232
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
My assignment

233
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Whisker help him

234
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Revised

235
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
Now this was happening right at the Larry Petri was getting started

236
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Local Department says the test company had pretty much accepted like

237
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
We need to change

238
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
But Wexler not too much

239
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Go to his apartment

240
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
East side of New York City

241
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,871
And they would go question by question what is the color of Ruby

242
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
Goffman argued that question is clearly biased

243
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,551
I mean the correct answer on the test is rubies are red but a

244
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Your family had more money you will more likely

245
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
To know what a ruby was

246
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
Andy Kaufman says Ruby was a popular name in the black community

247
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,095
So certain kids might think what he was referring to people

248
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Not gen

249
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,727
That item was eliminated but I understand it didn't always go. Either way with them

250
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,847
It was a little vain that he had him his

251
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
But I knew when you got upset

252
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
It would start

253
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Post a little

254
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
And he was

255
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
So upset

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
I thought it was going to

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
He says they had knock-down-drag-out fight about questions

258
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
But many of the questions we talked about in the last episode

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Ended up being removed

260
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
Bunch of Change by the end of this process how much of the test was different

261
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Probably 40% different

262
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Since that original revision

263
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
The whiskey has been revived

264
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Three more time

265
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Hello Susie

266
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,015
Yes this is Susie Rayford I'm the primary developer of the wechsler intelligence scale

267
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
I write the questions designed the research plan and Susie says the test today is way different

268
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
But it was back in the saddle

269
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
Facts about 10 years ago they replaced every question on the

270
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
And then we also see

271
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
Statistically analyze the items to see if

272
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
She says they're now able to do these assertive Advanced statistical comparisons where they can compare the

273
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Have responses of

274
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Black kids to rich white kids

275
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Poor black kids to poor white kids

276
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,271
Go through that kind of scrutiny and one group performs differently on a question they'll get rid of

277
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:43,647
You you welcome mat because you don't want to put something out that's wrong or that's going to hurt people

278
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,231
The biggest change though is the way the test is standardized

279
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
Usually tries to be representative of the sensor

280
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,399
This is Brandon Campbell against the former school psychologist we heard from in the first episode

281
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
How many African Americans were included the whiskey

282
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Is a

283
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Port of Call New Orleans

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,127
A population that are apparently followed the US Census

285
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Are much better

286
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
So

287
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Given how much the test has

288
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Changed

289
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
How do you feel about the fact that the band

290
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Still

291
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Dislike

292
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Stihl.

293
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
Psychologist from giving IQ test to black kids in California

294
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
Yeah it's ridiculous I I think I

295
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
When the state

296
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Dictates

297
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
What psychologist can and can't do

298
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
That to me is a problem

299
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,799
Does Brandon says an IQ test can give him useful information about a kid regardless of their race

300
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
When you're talking about IQ test you're talking about

301
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Ability

302
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Your ability to

303
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
See things visually

304
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
And be able to answer

305
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Questions around

306
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Patterns

307
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Writing so you can

308
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Target

309
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Particular

310
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Skills around

311
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Cognition

312
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Hello are you there now

313
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Yes can you hear me clearly

314
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
I can

315
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,559
Admit I didn't completely understand what Brandon meant

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Until I talk to this guy

317
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
My name is John Cato and I'm a dad

318
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Young man

319
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,775
Who experienced a learning disability in his young life

320
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
Johnson Counter with the letter P ban happened about 20 years

321
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,991
Is living in Santa Monica California the time works and transportation he was running the bus system there

322
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
And I his son just

323
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
He was

324
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
Hunting a complete seven or eight is in first grade and his teacher told John that Justin was having a really hard

325
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Hard time with reading

326
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
Even if you gave him the simplest of things to read

327
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
He couldn't grasp what you read

328
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
The teacher wasn't really sure what was going on there wondering if this just a reading specific thing or is there

329
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,079
Broader cognitive disability happening

330
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,943
So John decided to talk to a specialist and he recommended first that I get an IQ test

331
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
And so I went to his Elementary School

332
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
And requested that from his principal

333
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
And she informed me that

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
He could not have an IQ test because

335
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,583
And the state of California was that legal and when the principal said that what went through your mind

336
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
I thought it was crazy I said you know she was trying to explain to me

337
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,799
Why it was not allowed she knew there was some court case has he got it

338
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Understood

339
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,407
Remember 7 to take an IQ test when he was in his 20s

340
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,271
Trying to get ahead and army. Officer on that test I never heard of

341
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Like Magento

342
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
Why when you grow up in a very poor neighborhood

343
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Basic colors

344
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Blue red

345
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Purple yellow white

346
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
Brown I didn't know what that question meant unless

347
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
When it came to his son

348
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
If taking a test

349
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Even if it was by

350
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Could help him

351
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Sobeit

352
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
And I understand you know that the economic and environmental impact

353
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
About IQ test

354
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
But

355
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,687
My son needed one that accepting

356
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
The argument because of his ethnicity

357
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
They were prohibited from giving him a task

358
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
I first asked if I could wave it

359
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Is there anyway I can wave

360
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
And I was told no

361
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
My honesty said well

362
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
Okay then he's not African American

363
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
His mother is Caucasian and my history of my family

364
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
This mix race

365
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
So let's reclassify

366
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
She said I guess you can do that and then I said to her

367
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Look at the

368
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Certainty of that

369
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
Ultimately Justin ended up getting IQ tested by that specialist

370
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Just outside the school system

371
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
And in the end the test

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
Hope revealed that Justin had a very

373
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Pacific problem

374
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
What was determined was

375
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
Justin has his imagination

376
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
So when he was reading when he was younger

377
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
He couldn't separate

378
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
John says Justin Woods

379
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,239
Start to read a sentence but before he could get too far into it even just a few words

380
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,847
He would start to imagine what was going on and just get lost in that universe

381
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
He tried to read

382
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Go off and live it

383
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,039
And you can't do that like he would just never get very far before his imagination we take

384
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
And the IQ test help them figure that out

385
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
In a way yeah because

386
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,719
Thing about an IQ test is it made up of all these sub test

387
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,327
Into the psychologist with able to use it to figure out that Justin was fine with Matt

388
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
It memory was fine

389
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
I had a good vocabulary processing speed and

390
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
Puzzle solving abilities were fine

391
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,871
So they're able to rule all these things out and investigate the root of the problem

392
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
Which turn out

393
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
Beat his really active imagination it was a book

394
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
One poke

395
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
I got Justin Reid

396
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Enemies Harry Potter

397
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
He wouldn't put that book down

398
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
He was step Layton tonight and stop breathing it

399
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
That was the end of his problem

400
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
A reading

401
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,031
Brandon gamble cuz he's worked with hundreds of kids like just

402
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
When IQ test help to figure out what was going on

403
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,991
The Bedford Brandon says like the Larry P band isn't necessary anymore

404
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
He says

405
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,647
The thing that keeps her to keep his eye on now when it comes to these tests isn't so much the racial bias question

406
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
But something kind of bigger

407
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
The basic idea that an IQ test

408
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
Could be used to

409
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Define kid

410
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,471
There's a. And I would say from like the 1930s all the way through the 80s

411
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
People would just give

412
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Biq or cognitive pet

413
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
This is what happened to Darrell from the first episode

414
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,711
And of course the test was skewed against him because of racial bias

415
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
But Brendan says

416
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Even if it wasn't

417
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Even if there had been a white kid

418
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
Making a decision any decision about his future by just using an IQ test

419
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Affordable

420
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
You really don't know that get it's only a snapshot

421
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
Window of sitting down with this kid

422
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
The bariatric Clinic

423
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
I can't be the totality of who that child is

424
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
To really understand who your kid is

425
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
And every psychologist I talked to said this

426
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
You have to spend a lot of time with

427
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Visiting the home

428
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,735
Like observing a child in the classroom

429
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,623
Like extensive interviews with their families especially if you're working cross-cultural there's some things that you may not

430
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Understand

431
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
It sounds like your perspective on the IQ test is that

432
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Like

433
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
If you can you can evaluate

434
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Students without.

435
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,423
IQ test if you can't do IQ testing there's 99 other things you can do

436
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Weight sedan

437
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Why do it at all

438
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
I mean like I guess

439
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
I get

440
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
That it can be helpful

441
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Will sometimes like in the case of the kid with Harry Potter

442
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,039
Really what it was it help the kid was Harry Potter

443
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
That's what helps the neck Siri better so

444
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,743
If we're in a situation now where we have all of these other tools available

445
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
IQ test however

446
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Useful it can be

447
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
It also has some very bad mojo

448
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Historically

449
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Attached to it

450
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
What is it actually still worth keeping around

451
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
Yeah I found myself thinking that a lot

452
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,383
You know just like from a cure

453
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Cost-benefit

454
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Perspective

455
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Maybe it needs to go

456
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Yeah and

457
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,111
And that feeling until we came across this one story that

458
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
Pretty much completely change my mind about

459
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
After a quick break

460
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
Hello this is Kelly from Tokyo

Public understanding of Science and

465
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Technology

466
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095

More information about Sloan at

468
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
Www.

469
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Loan.

470
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,407
We have an eviction epidemic and too often we fail to grasp what that is

471
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
But it isn't sometimes when you look at stuff on the news why she is somewhere on the pole dancing and she should be home

472
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
We're children in the answer is if they feel like I need to get a security deposit I'm going to go out there

473
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
Can make it happen I'm Brooke Gladstone with the new series The Scarlet unmasking America's

474
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
Eviction crisis listen on the media. Org eviction

475
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
Hate walking back to g a regular mini-series on Pat Walters

476
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
Okay Pat so what is the story that you were referring to the

477
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
Totally change your mind about IQ test

478
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
At well I'm going to tell you but

479
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
First

480
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Let me do a quick digression

481
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
Maybe take a step back

482
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
First

483
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
In talking about the ups and downs of the IQ test

484
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Turns out

485
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
So much of it has to do with

486
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
How we talk about it

487
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,472
So I want to go back to an interview I did with

488
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Siddhartha Mukherjee

489
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Why is a cancer genetic

490
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Talking about

491
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
We talked to Michael G in the first episode of the series about the history of IQ tests and G which is the shorthand for judge

492
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
General intelligence

493
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
Can an inner interview keycap

494
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Circling back to this

495
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
One idea

496
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
About

497
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Language

498
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
One thing that we learned over and overalls from the history of Medicine

499
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,792
Is that the way you define terms the way you define anything

500
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Makes an enormous difference

501
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
As to how you evaluate

502
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
At what values

503
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Society places on it

504
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,752
I can give you a thousand examples from the history of cancer

505
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
One gave me. It was really interesting

506
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Has to do with breast

507
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
The wood radical mastectomy

508
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Contain the word radical in it

509
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
Because it was meant to addressed

510
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,392
The term route which apparently is what radical means of or pertaining to the root of something

511
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
That amore

512
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Socially and cuts

513
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Culture V

514
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
Into a word that meant aggressive and Brazen and therefore the right thing to do for a woman with a terrible disease

515
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,472
Workington extreme Mukherjee says more and more people inside their cancer as a

516
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
Extreme start to feel like

517
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
That would be the appropriate response

518
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Even if

519
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
It might not

520
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Disease

521
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
These words that we use in medicine and science are extraordinary important intelligence

522
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
The thing you got to remember it right off the bat

523
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Is that the word

524
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Intelligence is a colloquial word

525
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,512
I just cannot emphasize that enough

526
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
Like the concept of intelligence we predates modern Western science

527
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Yes you can look at

528
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
Ancient literature and you'll see that some people are are smarter than others like Odysseus is really smart intelligent

529
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Port Richey again

530
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
China

531
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,664
It has been defined to

532
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
Social and cultural practice and varies from one Society to another has varied from one Society to another

533
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,136
And for the history of human beings

534
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,184
We have found that perfectly acceptable

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Everybody understood that there are lots of different ways to be intelligent

536
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
Be intelligent just meant to be able to understand

537
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Should be a million different things

538
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Until 1904

539
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,872
Mitchell Spearman came along and said we have their flag on intelligence is defined as

540
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Your score

541
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
On this test

542
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
The fact is

543
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
According to both of these guys

544
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
It might be a lot more complicated

545
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
There is something

546
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
Captured in the IQ test called G

547
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
I don't have a problem with g

548
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Maybe send a shiver down my spine

549
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Spine because of human history

550
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
Problem with it fundamentally it's a fact

551
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
But I do have an argument

552
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
Making a simple one-to-one translation

553
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Between that idea

554
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
And the sting this word that carries

555
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
So much

556
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Value and meaning

557
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
The word being

558
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Is there a better word

559
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Yeah well

560
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,784
We should have called it something like cold was it function I mean a lot of the researchers I talk

561
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,344
Talk to psychologist even the test makers

562
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,976
Steam to be using words like cognitive function or cognitive ability more when I saw

563
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
All I mean is

564
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,376
He look I'm using word intelligence even though I said at the start of the movie

565
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
Calling intelligence a lot

566
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,824
Play Mukerji says like what an IQ test measures is your ability to navigate in problems

567
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
Your ability to navigate in problems

568
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,016
Yeah I don't really know what that means like I can picture problem space

569
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
I can't be more

570
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
Pacific done that because that is exactly what it is

571
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Sometimes in an analogy

572
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Switches

573
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,792
You meet a person who is a good General athlete

574
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Premier bike

575
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,448
And when you see them manipulating their way to space

576
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,920
They have a particular way of manipulating themselves through space because they understand

577
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Physical space

578
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
According to Mukerji problems faced

579
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Is

580
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
I know like that

581
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Bite

582
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Mental

583
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,232
Like how well can you move ideas pictures numbers around your head

584
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Your ability to navigate and problems

585
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Nipple hard

586
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Spell that gives me something

587
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Deputy of space there cuz it's

588
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Boundary

589
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
It sounded

590
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
A substance

591
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Yeah. Everything is just a space

592
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
It a space and it leaves

593
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
A lot of stuff out exactly

594
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
But regardless of

595
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
What you call it

596
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Even if you call it intelligence

597
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
G

598
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Whatever

599
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,320
If you use the test in a different way

600
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
At

601
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,392
A different altitude let's say

602
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
It can change the world

603
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Barry German

604
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
And not just

605
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
In a bad way

606
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Like if the IQ test has

607
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,448
Heroic moment in American history

608
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
It is her like stepped up

609
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
And saved a lot of the people that was designed to hurt

610
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Interest

611
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Okay

612
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
Tell me more tell me more

613
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
Okay

614
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,344
It's there early 1970s and the stories about this guy named herb needleman

615
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
He was a needleman was pediatrician

616
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,792
In Philadelphia at 6 feet tall brown hair blue eyes intense

617
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
Kind of arrogant guy very sure of himself

618
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
Beth Lydia denworth I'm a science writer

619
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,568
She wrote a book about her he was really engaging

620
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Did that pointy was fighting the Vietnam War stuff you've gone to Vietnam and started a nonprofit or he would

621
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
Bring injured

622
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Kids back to the US for treatment wow

623
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Dislike

624
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
Students like hanging out with him in here in history of crazy stories

625
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Anyway

626
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
When needleman was

627
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Training to be a pediatrician

628
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
I was referred a child who was very sick little girl that's hurting them in talking to Atmore a gun

629
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,192
On the NPR show.

630
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Technician

631
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,800
Needleman actually passed away a few years ago and they were nice enough to let us

632
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Use clips from their interview

633
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,688
This little girl shows up little three-year-old girl and Hispanic girl

634
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,528
From the local neighborhood was a poor neighborhood where the hospital is located

635
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,344
And this little girl was really in terrible shape

636
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
She was lethargic

637
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,392
Couldn't talk

638
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
It was a cute lead poisoning diagnosis and

639
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,144
I knew what to do because I've had a couple extras on it it was known that led to make

640
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
You sick but it was thought

641
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,776
The conventional wisdom was it could only make you sick at really high.

642
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
When I started the conventional wisdom was that 60 micrograms per deciliter was a toxic dose

643
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
For comparison

644
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Today

645
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
The CDC the Centers for Disease Control

646
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Have what color reference level

647
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
Which is that anything over 5 micrograms per deciliter

648
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Is

649
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Control arm

650
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,304
Planning fact we know now that there is no safe level of lead

651
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,400
In anybody's body but especially in children

652
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
This is an era when lead is all over

653
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
Everywhere all the houses were painted with waitlist

654
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,432
Standard instant payment the reason LED was put in paint

655
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
Was that made the pink go on the wall more smoothly

656
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
Sticky add Sprite and also when paint chips off and you get a big feast

657
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,888
It letting is actually quite Suites real little kids

658
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Sweet and crunchy

659
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Soap herbs are in Philadelphia

660
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Jesus kid with acute lead poisoning

661
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
After her

662
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
He's another

663
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
And another

664
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Another

665
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
He knows

666
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
High levels of lead are toxic

667
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
Restart the Wonder

668
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
What about low-level

669
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,904
I decided I would pursue it question was

670
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
How so

671
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
People knew that lead

672
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:57,376
In the body went into bones and it went it mimics calcium in the body so it would be anywhere in the body

673
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
That calcium would be found the tissue to look at his bone which can't do that you can't stick needles and kids

674
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
You certainly can't go cutting out pieces of their bone

675
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
He knew we couldn't get bone

676
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:14,528
And then one day sitting there in his office at this community health clinic

677
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
In North Philadelphia

678
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,464
He looked at children playing in the schoolyard of this Elementary School

679
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
And he thought

680
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,840
Are the answer

681
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
He Partners up with a dentist

682
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
Annie at the dentist ask

683
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
The parents to bring in their kids

684
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Baby teeth

685
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Right away the parents are like well we've got a little bit of a

686
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
Have to Ferry problem here

687
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
You know the kids the kids are not just going to

688
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
Give away their teeth I'm not going to

689
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Fund your research study

690
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
With my tooth fairy money

691
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
2 herb like Newman went out and he got all these silver dollars

692
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,584
The dentist Drive the kids to give him the teeth he then tested the teeth Moser due to flood levels

693
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
And brings in a bunch of the kids give him a series of tests

694
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
Extensive battery of neuropsychological tests

695
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Including

696
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
IQ test

697
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
And what he discovered the key thing he discover

698
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
Is that if you get this a little bit more last in your body

699
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,344
Like for every 10 micrograms per deciliter more lead in your blood

700
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Extremely small amount

701
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Your IQ score

702
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Balls

703
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Four Points

704
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
So if you're

705
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,120
Exposed to just a tiny bit more LED you get

706
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Four Points

707
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Go to court Dumber

708
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
On the IQ test

709
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,872
Eventually yeah his Four Points a lot so that the thing about it is like

710
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
The accused

711
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Test setup

712
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Takana put everybody on this bell curve

713
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Where you at

714
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Most of

715
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Most everybody is in the middle

716
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
And then you've got

717
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Assertive Tails rehab

718
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
The people who are

719
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,928
Score really high and the people who score

720
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
Really low

721
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,512
I would be around 1:30 low would be

722
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Tanner and 70

723
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
Enter four points in the middle doesn't make that thing

724
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
But if you think about it much larger

725
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
What we're actually talking about is Shifting and in Thai

726
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Higher population.

727
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
What that means is

728
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
The top you end up with

729
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
Half as many people were going to score above 130

730
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
But I feel like a lot

731
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah and twice as many people

732
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Scoring below

733
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,440
Wow when we published that in the New England Journal of Medicine

734
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,840
1979 it had a considerable impact

735
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,448
It made national news when he he had done it

736
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
He had shown

737
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,544
That a long-term low-level lead exposure

738
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
With actually connected

739
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Tua kids

740
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,408
Experience

741
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
I am in life

742
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,808
The study led the government to ban the use of lead in house paint

743
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,904
Put limits on the amount of gasoline not too surprisingly

744
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
The LED Industries

745
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
We're not happy

746
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
And they tried to discredit

747
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Permuda wynd

748
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,632
Who's the nasty. In our lives

749
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
The Houston of scientific misconduct

750
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,288
Big fight over whether his 1979 Boston study

751
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Was accurate

752
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Long story short

753
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,152
They realized it multiple times

754
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
And the numbers held up

755
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
So then would happen

756
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
In the mid-80s 1985 I arrived let have been reduced some

757
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:35,744
Any environment but then there are no constraints on the human mind

758
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,096
No walls around the human Spirit except those we are ourselves erect

759
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
And you decide

760
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
Let's cut the industry of break

761
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
You know what loosen things back

762
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Back up again

763
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
And there was a guy at EPA named Joel Schwartz who had been hired as an economic analyst there Joel Shore

764
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,224
Is asked by his bosses in about 1985

765
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
To calculate

766
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
How much industry would save

767
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
If

768
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
The regulations on letting gasoline work

769
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Lessons which was what the Reagan Administration wanted to do

770
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
And he says

771
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,792
But what about the health

772
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Effects

773
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
And he's told you know

774
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Just the way it is is what they want

775
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
So what he does so Joel Schwartz it was a clever guy

776
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
He says okay I will do this job I will calculate how much industry will save if they don't have

777
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Regulate letting gasoline

778
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
And that number was about a hundred million dollars

779
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
But then he did something else he did the first

780
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Major

781
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Cost benefit analysis

782
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
Just that linked

783
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Health effects

784
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
An economics

785
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Never really

786
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
Innovative thing that Joel Schwartz did

787
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Was to also calculate

788
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,704
The cost to Society of leaving lead in the gasoline

789
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
And the way he did that

790
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
Was that he used those

791
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
4 IQ points

792
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,432
They did it and economic analysis where they were able to figure out that for each

793
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
1

794
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
Point change in IQ

795
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
That equated

796
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
To 1% change in the wage rate

797
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Again on a population level

798
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
With every step down and IQ

799
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
There's a connection to how much money somebody can earn

800
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,144
You got lower levels of educational attainment and ultimately lower levels of learning

801
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
So when he did this calculus

802
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,776
The industries could save $109 if they have lead

803
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,664
Society if you count based on needleman's IQ for IQ points the cost

804
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,968
Society of leaving lead in gasoline

805
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
Was close to a billion dollars

806
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
Well that's based on

807
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
Lost education lost wages and increased health

808
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
He write this report gives it to one of the

809
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Top officials at the

810
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
ETA this guy named Joseph Cannon who had pretty much made up his mind that he was not going to regulate the leather industry anymore

811
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,704
Didn't need regulation there was no need from a regulation for apparently he looks at this report

812
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
And he said you just cannot look away

813
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
You cannot look away

814
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
January 1st 1986

815
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
The EPA

816
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,528
Effectively banned LED from gasoline

817
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Over the next few decades

818
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,392
The average blood level of Americans

819
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Dropped by 90%

820
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,864
Blood lead levels around the world the end of forks today

821
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Was a pretty important fact

822
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,824
The thing that sled Story made me realize is that

823
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
The IQ test

824
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
Certain thinking abilities

825
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Whatever you want to call it

826
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Intelligent

827
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Problem space

828
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
And when you need to find out if

829
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
Like an environmental toxin is affecting

830
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
The wake

831
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
I think having the standardized measurement of that

832
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
Is really powerful

833
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Enter something like the IQ test

834
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Lets you

835
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
See these almost invisible

836
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Like subtle effects

837
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Sunmart groups

838
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
Two people and after that led thing

839
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,944
There been many many many studies but you just you can go on PubMed and search like IQ test

840
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,016
Environmental effects and you find all of these amazing

841
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
Realities where people use IQ test

842
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
To look at the way

843
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Smog effects

844
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
Kids thinking abilities or

845
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
Or like violence in the neighborhood

846
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,072
Reminds me of what the judge

847
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,656
Said in the last episode in the in the ruling that

848
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Did essentially

849
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,312
IQ tester social evil masquerading as empiricism

850
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,592
This is kind of the universe

851
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,688
And it's basically the same test I mean anything we don't stay in the web story

852
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Patricia dad or stay here

853
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Is that

854
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Herb needleman

855
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
He did the studies

856
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Only white kid

857
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
People can say like oh the

858
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
The poor kids are scoring lower because they're black

859
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
He did it only in Waco

860
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,144
You did it only on white kids because he was worried because

861
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
A lot of dick

862
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,264
Cork it to her being affected by lead wear black and other minority kids

863
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
And he was worried that if you took

864
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
A sample of

865
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
You know

866
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Affluent white kids

867
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Who had low light exposure

868
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
And he took

869
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Group of poor kids

870
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
Highlight exposure who also were

871
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Black

872
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
The people would say oh the

873
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
The poor kid

874
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Squirrel or not because

875
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
I've let exposure but because they're black

876
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
And black people are less intelligent than white

877
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
Wow so he actually he actually segregated his

878
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Is sample

879
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Yeah so that he could avoid bias

880
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Their bias

881
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Exactly

882
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Yes so at the end of the day

883
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
I don't think

884
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
You can say that the

885
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
IQ test

886
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,176
Or even the whole idea of measuring human intelligence

887
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
In this way

888
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
Is anyone thing

889
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,856
The test isn't inherently evil in this way they thought people

890
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,928
You know not psychologists early but regular people think

891
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
About it

892
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
But

893
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
It does have this

894
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,840
There's some power in it and it was designed to do a certain

895
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Sing a bad

896
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Thing

897
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
But if you just go all the way back

898
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
The eugenic Roots

899
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
That's

900
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Like always

901
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
In there but it's not the only thing that's

902
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
Sounds like agents

903
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
The Shield episode

904
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
08 4

905
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
Unknown entity that still has power

906
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
Centuries

907
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,184
Wait what are you talking about what is NOA for it like what what is that unknown phenomena on

908
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Wiccan Marvel Comics

909
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,840
That was submitted for psychologists Brandon Gimbel throughout an interview he was

910
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:37,216
Talking about the IQ test but he was referring to this Marvel Comics organization called agents of

911
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Shieldon

912
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
Tetrick Homeland interagency Logistics

913
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Division

914
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
Because every so often the heroes in that show will find this

915
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
Object they called in 08

916
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
An unknown phenomenon

917
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
It's an object they know is

918
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
But you don't understand

919
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
What kind of

920
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
Or how to use it and sometimes these unknown phenomena can

921
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
You know it you don't even know what it is but if you touch it

922
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
Take you back in time if you could

923
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Disrupt you

924
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
Toxic

925
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
You can even kill you

926
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
