1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:24,064
Anjana barad this is Radiolab a couple years ago we did a show

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
About 8

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Crazy

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,904
Cold War CIA operation

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
And a little

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Trick

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
Did the CIA invented

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
To say something without

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
Saying anything at all

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
And it just felt like

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,752
This one survived with the moment you know with the Mueller report coming out and all the redactions and

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,800
Intelligence and counterintelligence

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Russia

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,128
Another story just going to resonate with us again

17
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,480
Ulcer feels like a throwback to an earlier simpler time

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
So we just going to play at this week

19
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,184
Hey I'm Jared I'm running today on the podcast

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Back a little bit

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
We have a cloak and dagger Maritime Adventure in secrecy and truth from

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
Reporter Julia Barton

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Just maybe first you can start off just by introducing yourself

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
Yes of a story for me begins with this guy

25
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Yeah my name is Jeff Larson I'm the data editor at propublica

26
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
Outfit and Jeff does a lot of their

27
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
Reporting someone in a case

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
It was

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Summer of 2013 you know that big story about how the NSA monitoring millions of Verizon customers

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
That just came out just watching the story like all of us are end

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Then the thought occurred to him

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
She's are monitoring all of these people pay

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Does that include me

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
So he goes over to the nsa's website

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,752
He was surprised to find it right there on the site

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
File a Privacy Act

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
For your metadata

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
They have live online for right there

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Service that they offer to everybody

40
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Until I went ahead and did that yourself you're requesting you say what do you what do you know about who I called

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
Who I heard from yes exact

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
What were you expecting

43
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,304
The best-case scenario would be just a you know a page of

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
All of the communications actually to my wife my wife's a Verizon customer and I'm an AT&T customer so I'll

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
All my phone calls to my wife

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
I didn't think that I would ever get

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
Any response back

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,712
So he hit submit expecting nothing to happen

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
It was actually really really

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Quick I think it was on the order of

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
10 or 12 days

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
You know we came to my home

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Address sort of a manila envelope

54
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
You know my wife

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
Call me immediately when she picked up the mail and said hey

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,728
You know you got it you got a letter from the National Security Agency and there was

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Complete panic in Irvine

58
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
So now she's looking in the cabinet

59
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Chris Paul

60
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
Beeping out exactly how many open up the letter could you read it

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Yeah I have actually have it up right now

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
The letter said

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
We cannot acknowledge

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
The existence or non-existence of

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
Such metadata or call detail records

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Pertaining to the telephone numbers you

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Exactly

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
What does one know when one hears that

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,960
I don't know I mean when your Porter and you hear that

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
It's sort of that you put you in this weird place so Jeff takes the letter into work

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,920
Next day and he shows it to a colleague been doing a lot of reporting on drone strikes

72
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Guantanamo and he's like

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
What the hell is this

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,064
Does it mean something and she said that was a glomer respond

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
How do you spell how do you say is it's how do you spell globe

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Glomar

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
Glomar is a

78
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
GL

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
M a r

80
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Bloom

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
What did you think

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Just of the word

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
I thought it was I thought it was some lawyer

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,080
And Kumar who had argued successfully argued the case

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Because it sounds like a bit of legalese

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,968
I didn't know the fascinating story behind it

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
So why start looking into it

88
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,856
And right away found this nutty story involving a nuke

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
A claw billionaire some manganese

90
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
And this classic tension between Secrets being really

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Necessary

92
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
And really harmful

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Sneaking

94
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
But to get there you have to

95
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Start with this guy

96
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
Okay start out by

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,287
Getting your name and how we should identify you know my name is David Sharpe

98
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
That's my real name

99
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
During the mission my name was David Schultz

100
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,183
So in late 60s David was working at the CIA he's been there for a while and he got called on to

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
This new thing

102
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,095
Called project azorian I started the program in 1969

103
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Here's what you need to know

104
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,775
In the late 60s the US and the USSR were playing this high-stakes

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
Chess game with their nuclear submarine

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Cruising around international waters and there was a lot of harassment than went on getting on each other's territory

107
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
In fact in January 9th

108
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Create a US naval ship

109
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Captured after leaving

110
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
Pan and everyone was worried that the Soviets had her code book

111
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
And there was an interest in getting even

112
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Well 2 months later

113
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
In March of 1968

114
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
A Soviet sub called the k-129

115
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Just

116
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Vonage

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
We don't know exactly why it sunk

118
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
There's all kinds of

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
Conspiracy theories about what might have happened it just sank to the bottom of the ocean

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
And once the Soviets

121
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Sentara search Cruise out

122
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Trying to locate it

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
And failed

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
We came in and

125
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Somehow through our sensor technology or

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,207
Whatever reason your conspiracy theory of Choice by tell you

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
We found the boat

128
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
So then the thought was

129
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
If we could get inside that thing

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Such a bonanza

131
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
There was a lot to be learned

132
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
Whether it would be the code books the cryptographic equipment for and it's the big one

133
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
Missiles it had it had nuclear missiles on the chief of

134
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Naval operations it really wanted to see if we couldn't recover that submarine the whole thing

135
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,975
Problem was at the subway three miles below the surface of the ocean and the pressures at that depth according to David

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
A roughly 7500 pounds per square inch

137
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
14 million pounds

138
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
No big one so their solution is to get

139
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
A room full of top-secret Engineers together and just start spitballing ideas

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
Like what if we just went down there to attach Rockets to it blast the target up to the surface

141
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
How do we catch it when it comes out what if we okay we could we can

142
00:06:53,951 --> 00:07:00,095
You put these pontoon or gas filled bags and Float the target up except that we can't get the gas

143
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,471
In there because of the pressure must have been amazing meeting or you could say anything

144
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
You could say that

145
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
So in the end they settled on

146
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Claw

147
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Idea was to build this

148
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Gargantuan eight fingers

149
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Claw and

150
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
And a boat

151
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
And then you would

152
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Put the claw in the boat

153
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Wring it out

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
On the high seas

155
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
And then you would lower the claw

156
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
3 Mile Long piece of

157
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Pipe string

158
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
And then like one of those

159
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Carnival games you know where you you have to grab the toy by remote control you would position the cloth over the sub

160
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
And exactly so

161
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
And then you would

162
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Yankees

163
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Off the bottom of the ocean

164
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Pull it back into the boat

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Gatewood open on the bottom of the boat

166
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,247
In the claw and the submarine would come into a chamber

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
And you would have it

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
I'm totally not making it up

169
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
The CIA made it up

170
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,303
Is it just sounds weird but they did it they got the money they got the approval from the president but they still needed to cover story

171
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
So they called up

172
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Billionaire

173
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
And they asked him or probably is people do you guys think you could just

174
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
Pretend to have a sudden interest in manganese mining from the bottom of the ocean

175
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,783
Because Howard Hughes was a known inventor it wasn't Howard Hughes

176
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
Living in isolation in Las Vegas is fingernails growing inches long and being pretty bizarre

177
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,047
You know I don't know if he was living in Las Vegas but the rest of that I think is probably pretty accurate

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
Anyway so the end up building this massive ship glomar Explorer the ship was called glomar

179
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
That's where the word comes from

180
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
Yeah it was built by this company called Global Marine

181
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Global Marine glomar and

182
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
74

183
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
They get the boat out there

184
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
They lower the claw

185
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
Clawson MI

186
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Bottom of the ocean where the sub is

187
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Anco headlights and cameras on it

188
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
So they could see what was happening

189
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Do you remember when you first

190
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Saw it

191
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,447
It was a very badly mangled hole

192
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
And we could see it very well

193
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Big actually could watch as the

194
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,151
Claw wrap its massive claw hand around the sub and begin to pull it back up

195
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
14000 ft

196
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,063
12000 feet above 9000 feet from the surface

197
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
We were beginning to feel some cautious optimism that we might just pull this thing off after all

198
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Then

199
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,119
I felt so just a little a little bump in the ship

200
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
And we went to the control center

201
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
And everything look normal

202
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
On the television screens

203
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
But then it suddenly occurred to the

204
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Operators

205
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
That these television images had not been refreshed in other words they were television images taken

206
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
Maybe 15 minutes ago

207
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
And when they refresh those images and got the real time

208
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Picture of what was going on

209
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
It showed that we lost

210
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
We lost most of the submarine

211
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Basically

212
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
The part of the sub with nukes

213
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
With the missiles

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
Maybe with the code books

215
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
And all the stuff they wanted

216
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
That part broke off

217
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
And

218
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Years of work

219
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Millions of dollars

220
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
Just slowly sank to the bottom of the ocean did your heart go

221
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,599
Yeah yeah it did it did it was it was

222
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Tinsley

223
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Emotional

224
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
And yet they find anything we still don't really know

225
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
They've never actually disclosed what they found in that piece from David's description it sounds like they didn't

226
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Get a lot but

227
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
There's a whole reason I'm telling you this

228
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
It's because

229
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Not long after that

230
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Bike intense

231
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Moment

232
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Disappointment

233
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
The story starts

234
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
The break-in the Press

235
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Turtles are starting to

236
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,391
Call up the CIA they're asking all these intense questions they're onto it

237
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
And the CIA

238
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Figure out what to say

239
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
And what not to say

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Jets it's a dilemma

241
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
There's no question about that

242
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Which brings us to Walt

243
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Walt Logan

244
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Which is

245
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Just to be clear not your actual name

246
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
What's a pseudonym

247
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
So in 1975 Walt was a lawyer at the

248
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
CIA that time I was leaving associate general counsel

249
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
And as a story with breaking and all these journalists were asking questions

250
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
It became his job

251
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
To develop

252
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
The response

253
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Simple

254
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Except not so simple

255
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,535
Yes there's a diplomatic element of what's going on in here that isn't swab

256
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,143
And that is that you have the Soviet Union and the United States

257
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
At odds

258
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
And the problem was

259
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
We didn't want the Soviets

260
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
To know either what we had found out

261
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Or what we hadn't found out

262
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Either way would have been bad

263
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,527
If we said that we didn't recover any information on Soviet missile

264
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,647
Which was the truth then that would tell the Soviets that they don't have to worry about the security

265
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Regarding their Warriors

266
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
David says we wanted them to worry

267
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
This is a cold war we might as well make them think we found something

268
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
On the other hand if we said

269
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
That we did

270
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
Recover information on the missiles

271
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
But we're not going to tell you that would be lying

272
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
And they couldn't do that

273
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
We don't governments lie all the time why can they lie because this is 1974

274
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
This is the year of Watergate this is the year that

275
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,903
Congress breaks the entire Federal Security apparatus over the coals

276
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
This is also the year they revisit something called the Freedom of Information Act

277
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,655
Boya

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,519
Actually Floyd been around for a while but that's when for you finally got some teeth

279
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Place has anybody any American should be able to ask the government for documents and the government has to respond

280
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
It has to

281
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
For cover that information

282
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Help

283
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
Are you put it this way

284
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
Well it's not a huge fan of this Loft investment

285
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Time

286
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Resources

287
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,375
And to willy-nilly give it over to somebody who writes a letter to the agency is is

288
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
The wall season the cia's job is to keep secrets

289
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
In keeping secrets

290
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Keeps America

291
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,455
In fact every CIA employee is legally bound to protect something called intelligence sources and methods

292
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
It's not an option it's a law

293
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Hence his

294
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
So very well

295
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,999
Under the foil all the public has a right to know on the other hand

296
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
He has a legal obligation

297
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
To not tell the classic tension of our times exactly

298
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
What have to say something

299
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
He has to be truthful when he says it

300
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
But he also

301
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
Cannot reveal anything

302
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
And people's agency have been trying to figure this out for months

303
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Is why they brought in

304
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
And how long did it

305
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
KQ2

306
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Come up with this kind of response

307
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
I would say probably a half an hour

308
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Well

309
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
That half an hour of work

310
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Tortured journalist

311
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
And lawyers for almost four decades

312
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Is we came up with

313
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
The glomar response was basically the following

314
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
We can neither confirm

315
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Nor deny

316
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
The existence of the information request

317
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
But

318
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Hypothetically

319
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
If such data were to exist the subject matter would be classified as could not be disclosed

320
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Very straightforward

321
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,255
I think about that that's that addresses what we were you were just trying to

322
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Put your finger on

323
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
You can't

324
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Confirm it

325
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
Which would be giving up Secrets nor deny it

326
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,471
Which would be a lie if it was classified you couldn't be revealed anyway

327
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,799
Suckers as you can imagine

328
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
People who file these foia requests when they got a response like that

329
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
They were like that's not going to stand

330
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
You are the sucker

331
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
They fought it in court and the fight went on

332
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
4 years knock-down-drag-out but eventually

333
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
The government wins

334
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,999
Judge rules in their favor well the judge agreed to their logic that sometimes

335
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Revealing even

336
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Existence of documents

337
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Endangered Nash

338
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Social Security

339
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:39,263
Kind of response

340
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
Bloated to the point where now you here actors like Will Smith using it confirm

341
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
Nor deny or Pixar characters using it Hollywood publicist

342
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
Confirm nor deny the rumor ex-congressman Anthony Weiner

343
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Konditor confirm

344
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
Norton

345
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Become this total

346
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,727
Boilerplate phrase of our time

347
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Swiss Viagra

348
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
How do you

349
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
Confirm or deny that Conan

350
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
But

351
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
But on a more serious note

352
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
Since that initial glomar response in 1975

353
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,647
More more government agencies have begun to use it surprisingly and not the obvious ones

354
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
We found some from the

355
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Department Commerce

356
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,815
Department of the Treasury Department of energy before then

357
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
Centers for Disease Control that this thing has legs

358
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
And it makes you wonder

359
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Why does this thing have legs

360
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Why now

361
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
It is weird like this

362
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
That guy that Republican guy

363
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
You started with

364
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Jeff Larson

365
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
It's all he's asking is what do you know about who I

366
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Call Andy on the answer is expecting to get it's like

367
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
You know you call your wife

368
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,439
Why would they glow Mart that well they told him in that letter that if they

369
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
Confirm or deny the existence or non-existence

370
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Of those records

371
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
It would help

372
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Are at the average

373
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Stories of United

374
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,751
I just I just so that I can sympathize with the United States of America for a moment

375
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Why would that be right

376
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,687
I gave they said you called your wife on Monday at 3 Thursday at 4:30 she called you back at 6

377
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
6/15 what would an enemy than learn

378
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
I guess that they they would learn

379
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
They have records of me calling my wife

380
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
Sodium statutory reason why I've read

381
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,815
You're sort of foias are denied with a glow my request

382
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,935
Is that if you say someone is under surveillance by acknowledging record

383
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Or you say they're not under surveillance by

384
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Acknowledging no records

385
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
Either way it's outlines

386
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
The Contour of the

387
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
The program is a tiny crack

388
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Through which people can

389
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Set of puncture the wall and

390
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,135
Get information about the larger program so you just given us the government's position that makes perfect sense to me

391
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Let me look at the thief or to come up and say to me I'm a cop

392
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
Are you investigating me if I say yes but he can

393
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
Can hide if I say no then you go rob another bank or the other robbers will know that I missed a really good bank robber and I'm

394
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
I'm terrible at

395
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
In anyway I seem like

396
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
I feel suddenly dangerously exposed

397
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,919
I don't know it's all very very confusing and you could wrap your brain around it and never get to sleep for the rest of your life

398
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
She thought about it

399
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
And by the way there is a we should say a very good

400
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Argument against that argument

401
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
That transparency is a good thing

402
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
If you have an agency that doesn't have any sort of constraints on it or doesn't have the

403
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Proper oversight

404
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
8 / steps

405
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,751
That argument from NPR special correspondent

406
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
Dina temple-raston when we come back from the break

407
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
Hi my name is Josh and I'm coming from Harlem New York

408
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Radiolab

409
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
Supported apart by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

410
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391

411
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,743
More information about Sloan at www.slha.org

412
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Thanks

413
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,727
I'm Jad abumrad this is Radiolab okay we're back with our story from Julia Barton

414
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,103
About the glomar response where government agencies refused to either confirm or deny

415
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
Something in response to a freedom of information requests

416
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
And ask Julie was supporting this piece

417
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,063
Robert and I called up NPR special correspondent Dina temple-raston

418
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Just a sound her out

419
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Cassia

420
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Covered counter-terrorism for NPR for years and so she been glomar Don drones she's been blowing hard on

421
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
Harris investigations I've never actually heard it

422
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
As being glomar

423
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
I have to say that she told us something interesting that this

424
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
Whole non-denial denial state of

425
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Weirdness

426
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
Has created some very unique situations for her as a reporter

427
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Seance

428
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Flanagan Monday

429
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
She sits down

430
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,783
Rights of foia requests about the Drone program which will get

431
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Glomar

432
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Then on Tuesday

433
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
The government will turn around

434
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Organize a meeting for reporters

435
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:19,071
About the Drone program a story about a drone target is out and it seems

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Incorrect

437
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
To the White House

438
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
In in a big enough way that they feel they need

439
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Correct the record

440
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
So they will often conduct

441
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
A conference call

442
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,591
On background with a number of reporters from a number of different organizations

443
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
And basically say to those reporters

444
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Okay here are the following people who are talking to

445
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
To you but you are not allowed to say

446
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Who they are

447
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
And they're going to put this in context

448
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:45,439
And you can quote them as and they usually set the ground rules in a senior Administration official

449
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
Administration officials familiar with

450
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
It's a program or something like that

451
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
And what then happens is they get to correct the record without

452
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Officially

453
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
Confirming that something is going on

454
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
There's an interesting thing about the White House in government that

455
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
That they believe that they still have deniability if

456
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
High-ranking official

457
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Who is unnamed

458
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Says something is go

459
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
And as soon as a name is attached

460
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,855
Then the information in their view fundamentally change

461
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
It suddenly becomes

462
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Concrete

463
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
And actually that's

464
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
Kind of what happened with the project azorian that

465
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
Glomar Mission from the 70s

466
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,400
Even now the only reason that we know half of what we know about this whole thing

467
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Is because

468
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,752
Some historians we're really dogged with airfoil requests

469
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
And they found out about this whole series of

470
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,408
Internal CIA newsletters and in one of those newsletters

471
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
There was a

472
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
An article with the title that

473
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Clue the man of this

474
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Glomar mission

475
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Before that

476
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
Pacific article

477
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,512
Yeah when they have a name of an article than they can for you that and then it's really hard for them to say

478
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,352
No documents exist because they have the actual title of it when it gets specific

479
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Yes

480
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
So the CIA released this article but

481
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
I mean by now

482
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
Decades of past

483
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
And

484
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
That's what

485
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
People now say about the glomar response is that it's just a delaying

486
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Because Congress and

487
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
I talk to this one guy Jamil Jaffer he's Deputy legal director of the ACLU and then get Clomid all the time

488
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
We've come to expect them now unfortunately you know I mean when they get a glomar

489
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
They don't get upset they just think okay

490
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Well we got another two years in court that's what I means it means it means you have two years of litigation before you even get to the point of

491
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
Arguing over whether the government has a right to withholding

492
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
What was what's happening with his two years

493
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Well

494
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
They're trying to strategize so if they really want to know about a program

495
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
And I really want to get those document

496
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
They will look for any sort of mention

497
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
Of those documents by public officials in the same agency

498
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
So

499
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Say you have a pen

500
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
And you love this

501
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
But you don't want anyone to know about it someone asks you if it exists and you say

502
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Say hell no

503
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
Confirm or deny right and then you had a party

504
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
And you just mentioned in passing you can't help

505
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Lovethispic

506
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Check out this

507
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
Right well I was nearby

508
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Now I take it to a judge

509
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
And if they look

510
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,688
He's talking about this pen at a party he's bragging about it

511
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
He can't refuse.

512
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,576
Confirm or deny its existence anymore so they're looking for cracks in the glomar

513
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
Yeah over this two years yeah and it's this

514
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,720
Really expensive legal strategy that most people can't even get to

515
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,608
Only big outfits like the ACLU can even challenge them and their government May ultimately lose it all

516
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,472
These cases but it will lose at a time when the public debate will have moved on to something else

517
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
And that's one of the real Danger series

518
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Next Step

519
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
By the time the truth finally comes out

520
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
We don't actually care anymore it's ancient history

521
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Not for everyone

522
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Bill the divers

523
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,976
Who are specially trained glomar Mission the original plumber mission

524
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Second David Sharp says

525
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
After they were able to

526
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
Pool that last

527
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Fragment of the sub out of the water

528
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
They were able ultimately to look at

529
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
Side and where there people in there

530
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
There were

531
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
There were

532
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
There were three crew members that were

533
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Basically

534
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Hole

535
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
And recognizable

536
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
And there were major parts of another three crewmembers but

537
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
They were

538
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
They were given the full

539
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Full respect

540
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
That I think the Soviet navy would have

541
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Conferred upon their own people

542
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Under those conditions

543
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
The problem was we were keeping the whole thing Secret

544
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
And that allow the Soviet government

545
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
To do the same thing

546
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,016
They probably didn't want the embarrassment of acknowledging that they lost this really important submarine

547
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,856
They also didn't want to derail arms talks that we were having with them

548
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,672
And for a bunch of other reasons they just

549
