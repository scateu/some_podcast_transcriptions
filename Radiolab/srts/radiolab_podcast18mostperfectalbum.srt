2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,504
Jad Robert Radiolab

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
Are these all 20

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
4 amendments

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Sia songs

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Oh my friend

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Did you say 24 Amendment for the 2727

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,192
I know every weekday Edwin every so often

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
Okay so

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
More perfect now is entering its third season right

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
First two seasons what were they they were

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,992
They were extended

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
Investigative

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,136
Highly reported and researched and elaborated stories about

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Supreme Court

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
Cases in front of the Supreme Court

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,280
But the idea was

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
Of more perfect was always broader than just the court I mean the idea is to look at the

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
The argument

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
It just so happens

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
Time in ND

24
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
Process of Americas

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
Trying to claw its way out of the month to get to it

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,456
Higher ideals those ideals of course are outlined in the car

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
Which has been amended

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
27 time

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
In waser

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Crucially important

31
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Especially right now

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,024
And most Americans can't name more than one or two of them I was one of those people

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
The Forum

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
And so when I was on my break

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
I had this idea

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Crazy idea

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Which was

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Could we make an album

39
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Could we make a Schoolhouse Rock for the 21st century

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
That reanimated the cement

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
Modern exploration by well

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
I said you got to go big right

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
That's a very didactic thing like that in those songs

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
You actually are told

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
Exactly how to feel about the contest

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes I'm only a bill

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Yes but Daddy was could we take the spirit of

49
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
But not like didactic in the way the old stuff

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,800
Southwest but like taking these things that we have been covering for two seasons the amendments to the Constitution

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
Bill of Rights 1 through 10 the other ones from 11 to 27

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
Taking them and cuz they're so so

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,064
Stodgy and musty like a language some of them are really opaque

54
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
Yeah I mean enter the idea was to take these

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
Stuffy stodgy sometimes opaque

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Deeply important

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Words

58
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Bring them to life

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,936
So we reached out to attend a different positions and ask them like would you interpret these amendments

60
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Are you can talk it

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
Explicitly about the Amendments if you want or you can turn it into something very personal to you but could they do it though

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
I don't know what means play you a couple of me

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736

1920

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Women's suffrage amendment

00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Stratified

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,616
Women have been fighting for the legal right to vote since the 1840s

85
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
In 1890

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
National American women Suffrage Association nawsa was established

87
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Was Susan B Anthony is leading Force

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
But women have been fighting for their rights

89
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536
Since the very beginning of time

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
We couldn't drink

91
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503

Tarrytown because the time March up and down the street

97
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103

00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Wow

99
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Do you want to hear another one

100
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
I mean I'm really curious about like a an amendment like a technical and I'm like the 26 like what could you possibly

101
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,351
All 25th is the is the one that's missing

102
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Session 1

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
The 25th amendment is the amendment that

104
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Establishes an order of succession if the president can't do his job

105
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
So Devendra Banhart

106
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Is a

107
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615

It's a whole genre hello my name is Devendra Banhart and I chose the 25th Amendment

113
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Truth about succession

He's an amazing songwriter and he wrote a really funny song

115
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Takes you through the line of succession 1600 Washington DC

116
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Even though I'm at the bottom of the list Allura and Ever Wanted

117
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,503
Please pay attention

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
That's been in place in the 1700 still today

119
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
It all began when the president

120
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
This state of Hawaii

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
11 West and the new negro moral compass in a developing

122
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367

123
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Tubing down the hall

124
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
New Speaker of the House of Representatives

125

Glendale

126
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
And so the president pro tempore of the Senate

127
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
Show that every person who becomes president

128
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Vineyard Vines that you meet the next one in the line

129
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
And I think I think assertive that the whole

130
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
What is that everybody dies in adults

131
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,911
With him being president has really went to law books

132
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
They just look very kids sometimes yeah yeah

133
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127

And I request

155
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,015
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

156
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:59,903
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments childhood brilliant

157
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

158
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
It just means you bring back and say whoa

159
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Maybe it was the moment that I

160
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,239
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

161
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Or maybe the kid was a piano

162
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

163
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

164
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
We're interested in the

165
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Epic moments where

166
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
For telling me

190
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Funny

191
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Poetic

192
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Sometimes sad sometimes hilarious

193
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Explainer

194
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Stories about each of the 27 Amendments

195
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,975
I think yesterday like audio liner notes for the songs

196
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
The story that we tell in conjunction with

197
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
The First Amendment

198
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Sarkari producer more perfect

199
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Creative

200
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Full story of my drop into the middle of it

201
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
Wichita newborn who is a law professor

202
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
And he to him the First Amendment

203
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Is like

204
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Poem

205
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Tow strap into that way

206
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
When you hear a reporter sarkari actor Jeffrey

207
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Rewrite

208
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Reading the amendments

209
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Professor Burt neuborne talk about

210
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
1st Amendment

211
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Freedom of religion speech

212
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Press

213
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,975
Assembly and petition

214
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,071
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

215
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

216
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
2 or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press

217
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Or the right of the people

218
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
Peaceably to assemble

219
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
And to petition the government

220
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
For redress of grievance

221
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
6

222
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Could have been written on the back of an envelope

223
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
These days the first amendment is

224
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Wrapped up in all kinds of

225
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Thorny stuff like

226
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Kneeling at football games and

227
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
Hate speech and money in politics

228
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
But if

229
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
You

230
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Just step back

231
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
From all of that

232
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,167
And you read the text of the First Amendment and you really try to think about

233
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
What the words are trying to say

234
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
You find that the logic behind it is

235
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Kind of beautiful

236
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
The order of the words in the First Amendment

237
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Is the life cycle of a democratic

238
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Trinity means

239
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,695
To boost first two clauses

240
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

241
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

242
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Create a

243
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Free space

244
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Inside your mind

245
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,335
Believe As You Wish that's the founder saying that's space inside your head where you think your thoughts

246
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
That's sacred

247
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
The government can't touch that there can be no government so that's the first idea

248
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
The freedom of your thoughts what you believe.

249
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
We don't want to see it which brings us to the next class abridging the freedom of speech

250
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
Call says if you got an idea formed in the freedom of your mind

251
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,919
So you the freedom to think about the freedom to speak that thought

252
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,551
If you really want to make a real name

253
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
See you need some way to be able to speak with people

254
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
In a very loud voice which brings you to the 4th class

255
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
4 ProPress

256
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,959
Which is speech amplify

257
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Once you've gotten your message out to a large number of people when people would listen to these ideas and move

258
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
It's natural for those people

259
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,527
I want to do something about it to move together

260
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
I'm too organized for the right of the people peaceably to assemble

261
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,511
So you can think of that even speak that.

262
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
You can create a movement

263
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Which is the 6th

264
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Idea at the petition process once you've assembled once you've organized

265
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
Web search web search

266
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
And to petition the government

267
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
For redress of grievances

268
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
I'm forced to government

269
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
Into confronting it and either accepting it or rejecting

270
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
And then that government if it says no

271
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Is subject to being voted out of office

272
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,359
Suited

273
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
This is Madison

274
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Giving us the blueprint

275
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
For tomorrow's Big Bang

276
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
When democracy begins

277
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,207
The way I'm hearing it is like

278
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Like cocentrix circles like starting and inside the mind of one person and then like reverberating

279
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
The first amendment is

280
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
A series of concentric circles

281
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Beginning within your mind

282
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
And then moving

283
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
So you're closer

284
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Acquaintances

285
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Then to the

286
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Society at Large

287
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Yeah I've been finally

288
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
To the entire polity to the entire people

289
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,135
By the way is the only time in human history

290
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
But those six ideas

291
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Never been United

292
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
In a single tax

293
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Only time

294
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,375
I went back and looked at every single rice bearing document in our tradition

295
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
All the way from the Magna Carta

296
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Through the English Bill of Rights through the colonial Charter through the state constitutions through the French Declaration of the

297
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
It's never been done before

298
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
To put the 6 building block

299
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Blocks of democracy

300
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Feet together

301
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
In a single coherent

302
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Text

303
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,279
The first amendment is the ideal city on a hill

304
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
It is the ideal community

305
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,679
Got the founders were trying to establish and remember

306
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
That was for the first time

307
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
History

308
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
I've never thought of

309
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
A little bit like some

310
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Kind of

311
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Very thoughtful relay race

312
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,927
Each at the Baton has passed its way it's the next logical step

313
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
To Turning what is inside you into

314
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Powerful statements

315
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Yeah so that's

316
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
So the First Amendment liner.

317
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
About now that you

318
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Me thinking about the way that God

319
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Describe the First Amendment

320
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
As this progression of ideas

321
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
I mean it

322
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
It just comes almost

323
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,223
Just invite a couple of centuries after people like Shakespeare and Cervantes

324
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Begin

325
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
Creating interiority like this

326
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Do you want to meet

327
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
It really wasn't

328
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Any place

329
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
To go to hear someone talking to her

330
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Or himself yeah

331
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
And not even

332
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
A couple of centuries past and then you get a government

333
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
The takes that idea

334
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,519
The people have an interior and that interior is

335
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Distinct and needs

336
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Protection

337
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
From the Devil

338
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
And then comes this

339
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Explain flow

340
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
I never really thought

341
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Yeah it's a cool idea

342
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
If it's interesting the song that that's paired with

343
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
On the album I mean actually that we got a couple

344
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
What different submissions

345
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
For the First Amendment but

346
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
One of them

347
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Came from

348
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
A guy named Joey Styles

349
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
Seizing native Canadian

350
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
First Nation metis

351
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Hip hop artists

352
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
West End

353
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,407
She made a song with sort of argues with a spirit of Burt newborns take

354
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
You should have looked at

355
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
It's sort of all the

356
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
People that have been left

357
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Out of that

358
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,903
How much rat ghost as far too I was dealing with the freedom of religion

359
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,047
Illegal for Native Americans to practice

360
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,655
Add am I specifically the Ghost Dance as a teen

361
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,519
150 to 300 mostly women and children Massacre for ghost dancing

362
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
It's me that shows they were

363
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Scared

364
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,663
They're scared of us having our culture and ceremonies because they have powers

365
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,807
I truly hope the warrior Spirit Shines on this track and our natural side of being Wild and Free set stone

366
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Sparrow Hood drama mystery

367
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,287
That is really I mean above the lyrics and the musical choices

368
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
On that there

369
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Are you really

370
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Challenge

371
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
Your senses the amendment a little bit

372
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
So that these

373
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,319
Songs the way they're written and the words they've been chosen

374
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
And then what do they mean strikeout

375
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Paul

376
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
