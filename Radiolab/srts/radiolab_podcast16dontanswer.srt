Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,400
You and the three organs on this podcast

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Cat is about a mon

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
Shockingly recent

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
A moment of win

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,592
What reporters

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Decide to tell on what people

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Will decide the value

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Really changed

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
So we can

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Take you back

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
To an evening in 1980s

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
Tom Fiedler a splitter reporter

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
The Miami Herald

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
It's late at night

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
He's in his office

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
That my desk and just infect packing up to go home my phone rang and I'm thinking I was by my wife and she's wondering

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
I haven't left yet

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
Set all right I'll pick it up pick up the phone turned out this

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
It turned out it was not a voice he recognized

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:21,664
It was a woman's voice maybe in her late twenties and she said to him I have something you need to know

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,272
It was a tip about one of the most powerful and charismatic man in American polity

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,392
Former Senator Gary Hart Who at the time was not only the most likely candidates

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
Become the Democratic nominee

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
He was very Potter

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
We going to be

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Next president

34
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Her words to me

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
4

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Gary Hart

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Is having an affair with

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
My best friends

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
And she told him basically

40
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
I can prove it

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
And I and I wish I was

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Rather

43
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
I guess so

44
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Thomas tracpipe

45
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Any thoughts on how what do we do

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Now if you're of a certain age you probably remember the story probably know what happens next but even if you've never heard

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
Heard of Gary Hart you still probably know the outline of the story

48
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
The accusations dial

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Not have sexual relations with that woman and after that the whole damn wall-to-wall media thing

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
Which just goes on and on and on until you want to take your head off your shoulders put it on the sidewalk and beat

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
With a baseball bat

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
But the thing that's easy to forget

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
Is it it wasn't always

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
Like this no

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Heart was the first

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
To walk into this Vortex of social forces

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:49,984
And after that the rules of political journalism in politics change almost immediately

58
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
That by the way is Matt

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,176
By national political columnist for Yahoo news wrote a book about this incident what you called all the truth

60
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,016
He's out of surgery this is the moment Gary Hart 1980s

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
7 win

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Political journalism slid off the

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Even argue

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
When it

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Finally got Siri

66
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
Well you know this flashback a minute cuz I think if I think the context is important

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,632
1984 heart kind of comes from nowhere it's a whole new ballgame

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
I'm in the race for the Democratic Presidential nominee runs for president dorms New Hampshire

69
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:29,664
Play to a clear-cut victory over Walter Mondale and becomes a political celebrity

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Let's country cannot stand for more years of Reaganomics for the rich

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Gary Hart a Democrat and proud of it

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,328
Misses tall good-looking Democrat he's got great wavy hair I mean dashing

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,888
Handsome charismatic

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
And young this is Leslie Stahl TBS

75
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
She's covered politics for 40 years now works for 60 minutes he was cool and smart

76
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,224
Women liked him too he's an empty Orthodox Democrat very liberal anti nukes

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
He is sort of the Bill Clinton before Bill Clinton

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,880
He doesn't get the Democratic nomination in 1984 Walter Mondale.

79
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Buy a nose butt

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
When Mondale gets

81
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Crushed by Ronald Reagan

82
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Heart is immediately

83
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
Presume to be the next nominee the party at a time when

84
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
These things were more obvious

85
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
So fast forward to 1987

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Like it or not campaign 88 is underway and the leading contender

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
When it is running double digits

88
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
Higher than any Democrat Annie's projected to beat George Bush

89
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
The Republican

90
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,879
Next president United States Gary Hart

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
It felt like

92
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Look this is a guy

93
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Who is

94
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Changing power

95
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
I'll take Sue is unafraid

96
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
To speak the truth who is willing to be

97
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Really clear about what he wants

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
That's Kevin sweetie he was Hearts press secretary in 1987 he joined the campaign

99
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Just a few years out of college

100
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
23 I'm idealistic

101
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
The first time we we really met

102
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
He I was wearing a necktie with

103
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Pictures of Lincoln and Washington

104
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
That's the ugliest

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Ever seen in my life

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Set my mother Maiden

107
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,207
Well that's a good beginning

108
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Remember why

109
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
He was really liberal and socialist

110
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Unafraid

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Do you spell

112
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
He said heart placed an extraordinary amount of emphasis on not just winning the campaign but what would they do

113
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Do when they

114
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Gotten off

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
He commanded

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
That attitude

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
So they rode out all these position papers on

118
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,551
Foreign policy energy International Trade the budget even what would his relationship with Gorbachev

119
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
There was something about

120
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
Heart and something about

121
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
What happened on the cow

122
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
And where it did feel like

123
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
The kind of campaign that I haven't seen since

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
When does the subject of what goes on below the belt come up if it all

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
I will

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
There were rumors

127
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Definitely

128
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
By this time there are a lot of whispers about his personal life in a lot of speculation

129
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
He's been married to his

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,175
College sweetheart Lee for very long time they've been separated twice

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
The long separations enjoying the separations he's dated openly in water

132
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
So it's a well-known

133
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879
Fact of life in Washington where he is essential

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
I'll figure it has a lot of friends in the Press Corps that he's dated

135
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
Now that he's dated people for extended periods of time that he and his wife have a troubled marriage

136
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,631
Not together and not together he stayed on Bob Woodward's couch for a little while when

137
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
She kicked him out at one point

138
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Nobody wrote about that the reason they didn't write about it

139
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
Was because of a very

140
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Old

141
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Very well-established

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,687
Convention could go back to the 20th century Franklin Roosevelt

143
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
Lyndon Johnson Dwight Eisenhower

144
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Gyros

145
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Towering figure

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Their personal life simply were not in play

147
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Take the example JFK

148
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,767
Leslie Stahl says when the Press was covering him vast numbers of reporters

149
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Knew that John Kennedy was cheating on his wife

150
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
That was no sick

151
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
But we wouldn't have

152
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Reamed

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Printing.

154
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Even if the Whispers were loud enough to spread around the country

155
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
It just wasn't done is a thought pay

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Nobody does

157
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Forget about it

158
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
Or hey that has nothing to do with

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
With steak

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
I think the feeling was the so what

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
You know we all get to have a zone of privacy

162
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
And assumption was that what happened in your private Zone

163
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
Behind closed doors had nothing to do with whether you were going to be a good president or not

164
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
I mean through a certain

165
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Uncertain

166
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Standards I guess

167
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
This is the world that hard

168
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,543
Still thinks he's living in that as long as it doesn't burst into public View

169
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
It won't be a star

170
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
The map by says that world is X

171
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Changing

172
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Because of a political earthquake

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Just over a decade

174
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Before

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
Talking about the Watergate break-in

176
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,303
Knocked out breaking that wall five people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee

177
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
Yale arguably the biggest scandal in White House history

178
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Yeah Nixon tapping phone line compiling enemy list

179
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
And for the reporters covering neck

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
It really is an embarrassment

181
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
You had an entire White House Press Corps

182
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Political process

183
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Campaign dresser

184
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
I followed this man Richard Nixon for decades

185
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
And somehow either missed the fact or failed to report the fact

186
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
He had some significant psychological issues and was paranoid

187
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
And could be corrupted I think there was a sense that

188
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
We let the public down

189
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,311
Leslie Stahl remembers it this way regular White House Press reporters

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
They should have been digging

191
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
Chipping away chipping away chipping away they should have been looking behind the curtain and so right

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
After Watergate

193
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
Reporters became tougher

194
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Saying okay

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
We have to be skeptical about

196
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Everything

197
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
And in particular

198
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
The characters

199
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,935
Meaning suddenly your makeup your personal Behavior who you are and your private moments

200
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,311
Matters a whole hell of a lot for the kind of President you can be in whether or not we can trust you

201
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
As a publicly

202
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,295
What character is the subject tonight of our weekend Journal

203
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
What Americans choose president's personal character traits are important

204
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
A great deal of scrutiny

205
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
I remember

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
There was a bit of a shift in

207
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
The kinds of reporters who are covering Nashville

208
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
They had a different orientation

209
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
And they were really interested

210
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
That's Kevin Sweeney again he says he was initially fresh

211
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Grated 5 reporters

212
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
Strange obsession with things that we're not really

213
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
Issues important issues in the campaign like age there was some confusion about heart Sage the fact that

214
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
He changed the family name his signature changed at a certain point is life he says when those stories

215
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
Usually popped up I I thought it was a false set of issues I didn't really take it seriously

216
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,191
Came to the rumors of quote womanizing or marital infidelity

217
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
You felt like you needed to talk to

218
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
I I did say it if if anything is happening it needs to stop

219
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
I mean this can't whatever it is I mean I understand he said you know nothing's

220
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
And he shot back and said they have no right to cover that that

221
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
That's ridiculous it's not an issue that you know why is that an issue that's not their job

222
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
And I kept pushing back tonight on max

223
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Kara weather

224
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
I don't care what you think

225
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
This is the new Conte

226
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Text that exist now

227
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
I don't know why or how

228
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
The rules of chain

229
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
The rules of chess

230
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
Joe Webb

231
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
This brings us back to

232
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Did Tom Fiedler the Miami Herald he was covering Gary

233
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
Heart going with him to all the stops

234
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Iowa

235
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
New Hampshire and so forth

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
And at

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
Seems like at every stop along the way

238
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Someone some reporter wood

239
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Raise

240
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
Her his hand and would say what about the rumors of his woman I

241
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Dump says that he would see reporters asking all these questions and he he was a little bit trouble so on April 27th

242
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
1987

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
He wrote a column

244
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Asking the

245
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,127
Is it ethical for journalists to be even raising this kind of a

246
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Of a question

247
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,991
Tonight I really came down to the conclusion that unless

248
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
The

249
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
Mediamaster reporters involved had actual proof

250
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,231
That this was a problem that he was a womanizer we just shouldn't be printing that

251
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Column runs on a Monday morning

252
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
That night

253
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
He gets the call

254
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
The voice on the other side says Gary Hart

255
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
Is having an affair with

256
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
My best friends

257
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Stumps truck as we know I told her that

258
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,663
My position had to be that I couldn't believe what she had to say unless they would

259
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,527
And I'm finally she said my friend is going to fly up to Washington

260
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:11,391
Next weekend and she's going to spend the weekend with Senator Hart

261
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,487
She said so all you have to do is buy a ticket on that plane

262
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
I thought well

263
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Would that be ethically

264
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
Okay what is inbound and what is out about

265
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,311
I mean character was his new obsession political journalism but according to Matt by no one had taken that character

266
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Into

267
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
A candidates bedroom

268
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,455
That was new

269
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
This is inbound because

270
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Gary Hart was publicly

271
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Denying that

272
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
He had been carrying on affairs with

273
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
With anyone

274
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,279
Clear oftentimes when Gary Hart was asked about these rumors

275
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Never asked directly to

276
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
It's about the rumors

277
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
He say something like that

278
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
It's no one else's business

279
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Now why is it not anyone else's bills

280
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Because it is

281
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,079
No but hasn't been the business of the American public for 200 years and it isn't today

282
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
He say something like that

283
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
The Fiedler says

284
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,479
A couple times when he's asked he did say something that amounted to an o

285
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
Such as if there was any truth to these allegations it would have come out long before the kinds of answers that

286
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Work non-denial

287
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
Denial another phrase

288
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
Came out of Watergate so my view at that

289
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,863
Point was if in fact there was

290
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Proof

291
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
That he was carrying on an affair privately while publicly insisting that

292
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
There really was no Bass

293
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,639
To this event that was irrelevant issue relevant to his

294
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Performances

295
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Dispute future president yes

296
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
Was a question of integrity

297
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,599
So we thought the only way that we are going to

298
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Find out if

299
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
If what the caller told us is

300
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Is true is

301
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
We've got to

302
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
That's coming up next

303
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Hey sweet Eliza coming from Milwaukee

304
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663

305

More information about Sloan at www.scoan.org

307
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,999
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

308
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
And I'm here because I need your help

309
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
And I request

310
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

311
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,127
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

312
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

313
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

314
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,207
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

315
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Or maybe the kid was a piano

316
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,119
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

317
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,727
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

318
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
We're interested in the

319
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Epic moments where

320
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,919
A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

321
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
If you have a story please share it with us

Tip

329
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Saying

330
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Can they carry hardest

331
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Having an affair

332
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
He thinks himself this is in bounds

333
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
If it's true

334
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Therefore

335
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
You've got to catch him

336
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Who's editor tells a colleague of his Jim McGee to go to the air but telling you this is what you're going to do you're going to look for a while

337
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Woman who looks like a model that's how the woman on the phone describes

338
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,031
Frenchie's described as a model blond in her mid-twenties and call me back if you see it

339
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
This guy Jim race to the airport spots this attractive young woman fits the description of course we

340
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
Later knew was Donna Wright so he boards the plane they land in DC he follows her out of the airport to a cab

341
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
He runs to another cab jumps that any says follow that cab just like the movies The Witch picked who

342
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,583
He loses her for a while but then eventually you get to the house where he thinks

343
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
Heart and this lady should be Han he's not there more than a few minutes when the front door opens and

344
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,335
Now comes the young woman on the arm of a very handsome man

345
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
Jim had never met Gary Hart had no idea what your heart look like

346
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
I really couldn't pick Gary Hart out of a lineup

347
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
That's when I really thought we have got

348
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
To go to Washington

349
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
And that's what they do the Harold Matt by again they send a team of reporters investigative reporters NC

350
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Delorenzo photography to Washington we arrived Saturday morning they stake out his townhouse

351
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
I'm thinking my gosh somebody will surely notice that there are four five of us lurking as problem

352
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
Fight word it's May and one guys in a parka

353
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Disguise himself infielder who the candidate knows is in a jogging suit and he's pretending to jog around the street all day long I would

354
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
Change clothes a little bit

355
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
Occasionally I would run without the jacket

356
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Other times I would just be wearing a t-shirt and shorts that you run around around around

357
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,495
What you'd expect from a newspaper are proton quotes takeout went on all day into Saturday night and it got dark

358
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
And then

359
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Front door opens

360
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Outcomes

361
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
This man and outcomes

362
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
The blonde woman part walks out with Donna Rice

363
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
Arm in arm Keys quickly realizes something is wrong

364
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,487
Any kind of makes the surveillance they see him he sees them he turns her back around they go inside go back inside the

365
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Townhouse

366
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,863
He sent her away through the back door and then he comes back out of the townhouse

367
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Hopsin's car

368
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
And starts to drive off

369
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
So our photographer starts the chase Senator Hart car he drives a couple blocks up streets

370
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
Down Streets back and forth he gets out of the car

371
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,183
Following Ducks around the corner be losing for a second then they're running to catch up and then baked

372
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
And there's hard

373
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
There is the presumed nominee of the Democratic Party

374
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
The most important Democratic politician in the country

375
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
And they're confronting each other

376
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Infer moment

377
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
Standing in the alleyway behind hartstown house they just stare at each

378
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Because there is no script

379
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
At this moment

380
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Ultimately

381
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,479
Pepe reee he asked what who are you

382
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
Well we're from the Miami Herald and

383
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
He didn't really say anything

384
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
So

385
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
So I told him that

386
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,047
He wanted to know why he was meeting with this woman in his townhouse

387
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
A woman who at that point we knew

388
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
Had spent the night with him he says in Myriad ways myriad Times

389
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
I'm not going to tell you that

390
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
That woman was

391
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
This is private

392
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,127
This isn't public but he says there's no Affair which he would maintain Forever After

393
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,991
And I ultimately he's had. I've said enough

394
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,063
And he turned and walked inside

395
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Slam the door

396
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
We did tell him though he said we're going to write this story

397
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Unless

398
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
We you give us a reason as to why

399
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Explain this to y

400
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
What we are seeing and what we're concluding is wrong

401
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
He never did

402
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
So we kind of look at our

403
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Cells and said well now what do we do

404
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Ultimately the call was

405
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
We have the proof

406
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
We feel we needed

407
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,183
We know that publicly he was saying these things and we now know that privately he was engaged

408
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:18,047
So they ran back to the hotel room Fiedler frantically typed out the story

409
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Gary Hart

410
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,471
, who's presidential campaign has been dogged by rumors of womanizing

411
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
,

412
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,895
Friday night and much a Saturday with a woman who came from Miami to meet

413
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
I finally went back and I I probably slept for three or four hours you're going to do the story The only thing that

414
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,463
It gives me pause as if you're under this standard you lose Jack Handey certainly

415
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
Yeah lose Woodrow Wilson

416
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
I think

417
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
So

418
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
You lose a lot of

419
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
People

420
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,239
You might not want to lose but you know I a leap to the conclusion that the

421
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
The public would vanish

422
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
A person for that

423
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
And I I don't

424
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
I don't go there

425
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,407
So are you worried about how it's going to land

426
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
That's a pretty sure Jamie York

427
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Terrified

428
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Apus jobs

429
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Terrified

430
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
And the next morning political world explodes

431
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,328
Gary Hart truly became a firestorm

432
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Park 12

433
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
The Miami Herald reports

434
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,384
Washington townhouse that Story begins ricocheting around the country on

435
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
So by Sunday

436
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
Very apparent that only has heart in trouble

437
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,696
But the entire culture of media around politics

438
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Text has changed in some very dramatic way

439
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
And when you think about the mindset of

440
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
The television people the radio people the newspaper people

441
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Is there any

442
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,616
Self Doubt there is there people in a shoe is this really a question

443
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
Some of his ability to conduct matters of

444
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760
State is that question being asked there's a tremendous amount of self

445
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
Not everyone agrees that such intense public scrutiny is necessary there was widespread feeling the Miami

446
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,256
Miami Herald was put on the defensive at week Fiedler and his colleagues have done was wrong

447
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
You know that's not a bomb

448
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
What business is it

449
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
You staked out a guy in his home

450
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
What is a up

451
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Sneaking around in the bushes

452
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
And one reason is this

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Nobody knows where this is going to lead

454
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Set a precedent

455
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Should reporters be staking out George Bush's house

456
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,504
Bruce Babbitt House Joe Biden

457
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
There's generally the sense of

458
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
But you know

459
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
What was he thinking

460
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Part is to blame

461
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Gary Hart

462
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
And didn't he understand that things to do

463
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Changing doesn't the public maybe have a right to

464
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,608
Cancel the newspaper that began the controversy is not backing down

465
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
This was not character assassination

466
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
This was character suicide

467
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,592
He did it we didn't even ask that debate heats up over the ethics of its coverage of Gary Hart

468
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
So there was there was a real conflict

469
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,272
The all the various Echelon of media respond to this differently the New York Times refuses to

470
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
To touch it originally The Washington Post is deeply conflicted

471
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
And as for the

472
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Publix

473
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
An unscientific Herald telephone pole

474
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
63% of the caller said they thought the paper was making too much of a fuss over Gary Hart in the polling shows

475
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,144
Was that people think the media overstepped

476
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
You still pulling very strongly he's winning in the public mind according to Leslie Stahl most people seem to be with

477
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Willing to compartmentalize

478
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Most people

479
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Can split off

480
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
How's it going to be as president

481
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
And you know is he cheating on his wife will not clear that the tide was going to take heart out

482
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
At all

483
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,416
So how did his team try to get ahead of the story they scheduled a press conference in New Hampshire

484
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
I don't know flight over Kevin Sweeney is press secretary

485
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Epson I remember

486
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
Asking hard question something like have you ever been unfaithful to your wife

487
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
And he shot back at me with angry so I don't have to answer that

488
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,824
Question that's a question that that I can answer to God to my wife but it's not a question that I need to answer in Polish

489
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
That's a dangerous question to be asked

490
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
We don't want to go there

491
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,504
And I just said that's a great answer just hold that anger that's that's an appropriate response

492
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,392
Then we get to the press conference

493
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
Heart and sweetie walk into this colonial-style room Dartmouth College

494
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
Lights everywhere the room is filled wedding it's hot as more media than anyone's ever seen packed in it's a really

495
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
Intense environment has very little buffer

496
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
And he's handling the questions

497
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
Again really pretty brilliantly time goes on

498
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
Adjustment your character on issues that affect their lives and their families their Nation that's what this campaign is

499
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
Firing on all cylinders and heart goes through you know 30 minutes 40 minutes of questions and then

500
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:17,824
In your remarks yesterday raised the issue of morality and you raise the issue of fruitfulness

501
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
At some point he calls on young reporter named Paul Taylor and Taylor

502
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
Walks him through a series of question

503
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
Said you did nothing in Morrow did you mean that you had no sexual relationship with Donna Rice last weekend or any other

504
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
Do you believe that adultery is involved

505
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
Senator have you ever committed adultery

506
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
Earnhardt looked out at the Sea of reporters

507
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
Nope no politician has ever publicly been asked that

508
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Broad Direct

509
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,456
The question about his personal Behavior it really just

510
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
It shocked the room

511
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
We don't know what your heart was thinking of that more money

512
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
Did not want to be interviewed on today

513
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
But it's clear that she said yes or no to that broad of a question that his entire married life

514
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Have you ever

515
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,656
Adult to read that word ever his entire married life would suddenly be in

516
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
As far as we know no other person in his situation in history

517
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
That ever been asked

518
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
To drag that much of themselves

519
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
In the Limelight

520
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
Turn on Space you can see that he knows if this is never going to end I mean he he knew how many women eat seen over the years he could Envision them

521
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Small being paraded

522
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Through the papers

523
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
He could tell already that there was all this news

524
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Cowboy press and that

525
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Political process

526
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,048
Following along that he was never going to be able to talk about his agenda

527
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
And

528
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Heart stumbled around for a minute

529
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
And ultimately

530
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
He says

531
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
I do not have

532
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
I hope I don't have to dance

533
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,456
When I heard that response

534
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
I felt

535
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
The tone

536
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Was such that it is

537
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
It felt like

538
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
It felt like he is exhausted

539
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
And he can't take

540
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
And I

541
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
I was offended

542
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
I

543
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
I really in that moment. This is just

544
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Wrong

545
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,336
This has nothing to do with with what

546
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
What is necessary to run this country

547
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
And I just thought this is not

548
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
This this this is not

549
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
Wiki We're not gonna survive

550
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
And that moment

551
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Effectively does Hemet

552
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
What time is it

553
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,008
Gary Hart his finished as a presidential candidate Harry Hearts Cuomo campaign is only 3 weeks old was simply no putting

554
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Putting the genie back in the bottle of appearances yesterday worm obscene campaign has been hammered to its knees asking

555
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,808
The same questions again and again today after what may be remembered as the most disastrous week any presidential can

556
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Candidates in Diridon years

557
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
The heart told anaid

558
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Let's go home

559
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Couple weeks later that

560
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
Famous image of Gary Hart and Donna Rice

561
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Comes out the National Enquirer

562
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
And

563
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
That's it for people my age like that that image

564
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Donna Rice

565
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Sitting in his lap

566
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Get the shirt on the face

567
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Monkey Business

568
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
That's that's the thing you remember

569
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:36,992
According to Matt by you can look at this whole story because Tom Fiedler taking that call

570
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Paul Taylor asking that question

571
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,856
As this moment when all these forces

572
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Way outside of Gary Hart's

573
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
People come together

574
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,000
Not Justa sink his campaign but the change political journals

575
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Profoundly

576
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
But

577
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
As with all cultural shifts

578
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,424
There's more than one way to look at this so just for a gut check

579
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,776
We put the whole story time Fiedler

580
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Can we have you introduce yourself

581
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
I'm Cokie Roberts

582
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
But now we can who you are like

583
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
Part 2

584
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,064
56 Grant mpre

585
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,880
But I'm a political commentator and author

586
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,720
Cokie Roberts bellezza yeah reporters were injured

587
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
Hidden character more app

588
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,424
But it wasn't just that it's important to keep in mind here is that there were many more women

589
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Covering Canada

590
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
It's at that point then there had been but

591
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
The four

592
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
There were women on the bus

593
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
And in the case of

594
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Gary Hart

595
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Several of those women had had

596
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,944
Personal encounters

597
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,064
There were times when you be in a room where he had to hit on every woman in the room

598
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
So

599
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
This was not somebody that

600
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,696
Women who recovering campaigns

601
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
Ignorant of

602
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
And the other thing to keep in mind

603
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Robert is that

604
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
IHome

605
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Women's movement

606
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Did talk

607
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
Quite a bit about the

608
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
The personal is

609
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Is political

610
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
And because the way women were treated with something that

611
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
We thought and I continue to think

612
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Is a

613
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
A good gauge of character

614
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
And there was something of a sense that

615
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
Have you treated women like Kleenex

616
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
So

617
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
We work

618
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
Expanding the universe of what was a major Cara

619
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,840
So then are you kind of are you kind of routing Fiedler on absolutely

620
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
Finally somebody

621
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
Nevada and fight and thank God it's

622
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,568
As much as you were cheering them on was there any concern that that was changing the rules

623
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Journalism

624
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Why

625
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Because

626
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
The rules of Journalism were constantly changing

627
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
As they should

628
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
According to Cokie Roberts this was less about journalism

629
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Then

630
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,160
About journalism catching up

631
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
With the ethics of the time

632
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
Look we elect our presidents

633
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
Are based on who they are not on what

634
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Policies they stand

635
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
It's different from any other office

636
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,520
The voters need to know as much as they can humanly no

637
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
About that

638
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,432
So is there a line for you is there a place you won't go in taking the full measure of a

639
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
I am not

640
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
If a president that I can

641
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
There's nothing you wouldn't touch

642
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
No

643
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
We not have to know that it was true

644
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
Sure but

645
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
No

646
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
No

647
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Leslie Stahl had a slightly

648
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
She's fabulous cookie robber

649
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
I didn't go there that's interesting

650
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
I just didn't want

651
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,616
I just didn't want to ask about it I didn't want to go there

652
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
I'm telling you this

653
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Even though

654
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
I covered Watergate

655
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
And would have asked

656
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Any number of question

657
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
It's about character

658
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,952
You know it's open season fell as the public needs to know this but you know

659
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
Sex is really a hard place for me to

660
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Cry

661
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
So

662
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
I agree

663
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Re with it

664
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
But I also have my own

665
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Opinion

666
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
That

667
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
There's propriety

668
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
And

669
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm old-fashioned I guess am I I don't know

670
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
I'd intended

671
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
Quite frankly to come down here this morning

672
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,904
Read a short carefully-worded political statement this is Gary Hart statement

673
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
A few days after that person

674
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
Saying that

675
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
I was withdrawing from the race and then

676
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
Quietly disappear

677
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
And then

678
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,728
Frankly tossing and turning all night by myself

679
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Hell no

680
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
I'm not going to do that because it's not my

681
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
My style and because

682
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
I'm a proud man and I'm proud of what I've accomplished

683
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
In public life

684
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
Some things may be interested

685
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
That doesn't necessarily mean they're important

686
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
We're all going to have to seriously question the system

687
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
Selecting our national leader

688
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,864
That reduces the Press of this nation to Hunters

689
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
The presidential candidates to being hunted

690
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Politics in this country take it from me

691
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,848
Is on the verge of becoming another form of athletic competition or sporting match

692
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
We all better do something

693
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
To make this system

694
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Work

695
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
We're all going to be soon rephrasing Jefferson to say I tremble for my country

696
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
But I think we may in fact

697
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Get the kind of leaders

698
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
We deserve

699
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,264
No we did reach out to mr. heart for comment

700
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Explain to him the story we were doing

701
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
He wrote back this

702
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Response

703
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
Thank you for your letter and the invitation to participate

704
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Story

705
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
No I did not

706
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Become president

707
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
My life continues to

708
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Asteroid nearly

709
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Rap someday someone will tell that

710
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
But for now

711
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
I have no interest

712
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
In revisiting what many consider

713
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
A turning point for the nation

714
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
Fun in just

715
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
I do believe that the

716
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
Full and accurate story of that event

717
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Remains

And

Totally different car
