1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,704
Listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,824
Radiolab WNYC

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,040
Come On Eileen

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
Hey this is Radiolab on something that's a little bit unorthodox today least for us

5
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,024
Yeah if you listen to the show in the last

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
10 years

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
You understand it like

8
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
We like to edit

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Brightwheel

10
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Do you like a good at it

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,288
Or 70 but today play something that has

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
Almost no edits at all

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
It's just a conversation

14
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,664
Which is of course the foundation what we do

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
These long

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Rambling

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
Occasionally profane

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Error

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,392
Strewn conversations that we've been at it into something coherent

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Today

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
I want to show you the messiness no edit

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
This is a

23
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
Chunk of a conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
He came and sat down with us

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
A while back

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Can we talk

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
4 hours

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
Two of those hours

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
Became the basis for

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
Crispr podcast it was a few podcasts to go this about Gene editing

31
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
Then we kept on going for another two hours and he told us

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
This story actually two stories with rolling play one

33
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
That I thought was really cool

34
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
It's about this

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
New way of looking at life

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
It's not a

37
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah we can get through this a lot faster than

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
I really like

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
How do I I need

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
Perfect perfect way to describe

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
Biological bomb Okay so

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Chappie

43
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
After 2

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
The story monster

45
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
What's the Once Upon a Time

46
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
So

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Once Upon a Time

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
Being

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
I say what

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
Once Upon a Time being before 2003

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,864
We basically had two kinds

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Of

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Living things on

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
That we had

55
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Cellular life and we had Myra

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Send

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
There was nice and distinct

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
And clear-cut

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
And so

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Cells included

61
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
It's our bodies made of cells and

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Bacteria which

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Single-celled

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
All the other

65
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Things that can grow and let their cells divide they have DNA they have proteins in the mail.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
And then over here you have virus

67
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
Viruses were just little packages of genetic material that

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Would go from cell to cell and use the cell to make new virus

69
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
Enter inside of the mall they had with jeans

70
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
And

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
A couple proteins that

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
What then

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Hijack

74
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Their house seem like soap

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Soap

76
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Preliminary

77
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
They don't even maybe not even qualify as life right

78
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
They can't grow on their own

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
They can't generate their own energy

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
So

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Austin Eliza Schuyler life we

82
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Mii Maker

83
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Kind of fuel called ATP

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
We need that

85
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Do every little thing in our body and virus

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Oasis don't make ATP so

87
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Can we say that life is

88
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Ice cells and multicellular being

89
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
And

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Then there's a

91
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
Like sort of

92
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Pseudo life

93
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
When you have these little

94
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah yeah a lot of people a lot of Sciences don't really think viruses are truly alive

95
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
Even though they just have to take advantage of life

96
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
To make more copies

97
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,280
Custom questions of viruses they don't have a wall around them in the way they sell cells are walls

98
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Essential ER walldorf

99
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,400
They might have a protein shell

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,544
Ends and so you know when the flu virus goes into a cell that protein shell

101
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,664
Breaks open and the genes and proteins inside come out that you have containers

102
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
The contain them forgot for a while

103
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Isn't that one of the

104
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
Somebody who had a had a list of

105
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
Rules that make you alive and what was in that container was one of those rules

106
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
If they have the container

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Right so the problem with viruses that they have

108
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Some of the things that we think are essential for life

109
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
But not quite all of them so

110
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
It's been convenient just to say viruses are not

111
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
I'm over there cuz I don't have everything

112
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
That cellular life has

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
What is Heather now

114
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Got a virus

115
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Gotcha

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
And then

117
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
So then what happened is that there was a scientist named

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Timothy rowbotham

119
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
In England

120
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
Who was investigating a

121
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Timothy Rudolph

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
English name in rowbotham with a fuzzy robots and was was working in Bradford

123
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
City in England

124
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
And

125
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
She was

126
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,615
Looking at the kinds of bacteria that might be growing in

127
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
A hospital

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,527
Yeah like they're they were having some problems with pneumonia outbreaks in Saint and he's like okay what

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Growing around

130
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
And so he went to

131
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Turn off cooling tower

132
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,999
Pur water on top of the hospital and he took a sample in the

133
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,119
Went and put it under his microscope and he's like some interesting bacteria are all here so

134
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Very interesting bacteria that

135
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
Didn't I look like anything I've seen before

136
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,615
Stop and just kind of crawl around to weird places and just snatched little snippet to

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Scummer what Woody

138
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
John is a microbiologist

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
So it would be good to know like I mean

140
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
I don't like about just do it just go scrape little

141
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
It's a rocker

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
What are 10 words the world I mean microbes are everywhere so microbiologist go everywhere to find microbes so there

143
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Steven Universe

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Water tower on hospice

145
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,239
Received it with you in a in a kind of an investigatory role he was trying to help them

146
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
Help them figure out which bacteria

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Make music

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
I'm that was one of the hopes

149
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
But he was

150
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Thinking of doing a survey because you know their diseases like Legionnaires disease which

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,367
You know I grow in these desert containers of water

152
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
You know that's

153
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
There there's some concern about that

154
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
That's so you know better to get to know what's growing

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Tow

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
He's particularly taken by one

157
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Thing that he assumes is bacteria and it's got a kind of interesting kind of rounded shape America

158
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
And when bacteria around you can call him

159
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Cocci

160
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
A caucus

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
I'm so he names this Bradford caucus

162
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Give it a name

163
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
That's why the caucus name it comes up as referring to the shape

164
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Except

165
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Streptococcus

166
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Is because it's

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
It's round

168
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
I did not know

169
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,583
The things you learn

170
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
So so

171
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
He's trying to study this thing and it's trying to

172
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
So one when your machabeli just the way you study bacterias you get them to grow

173
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
And he can't get this to growlies feeding at things in a cell

174
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
I crying why is it not growing I can't figure it out and

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Eventually

176
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,599
You know he e just hit the hit the wall

177
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
And unfortunately

178
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
His lab

179
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Got shut down

180
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm in so he

181
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Basically said okay I don't want to

182
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Throw the stuff out

183
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
I'm going to

184
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm going to give it

185
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
To some of my colleagues in

186
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,871
It was it wasn't dying which was growing scientist named Bernard lascola

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
And is called

188
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
And they going to put a butterfly

189
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
And then he just says I'm

190
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
You just set that aside for a while and doesn't you know

191
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
Was just more bacteria you know and end

192
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Ads for some reason

193
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
He decided to

194
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
I'll take a look at this Bradford caucus

195
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,887
You know I'm like what was this thing that that robot them

196
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
I was talking about

197
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
So he looks at it and he says

198
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
Okay this is the size of

199
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Bacteria on butt

200
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
It looks like a gigantic virus

201
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
A virus is usually very small

202
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Exactly

203
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
Tell bacteria to a virus is like

204
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
Like hundreds of times bigger hundreds of times

205
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Hotel Queen Mary 2

206
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
Writing that he looked up close and he was like

207
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
What is this thing

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
This doesn't look right this this

209
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
If I didn't know better I'd say this

210
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
This was a virus

211
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Vis-a-vis based on

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Internal Orion

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Chichen Itza pyramids

214
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,199
Mexican that had the protein thingy and host of viruses they have a shell

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Beta protein

216
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
And the shells going to compose a plate

217
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
So it kind of looks like a soccer ball

218
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
Says a very distinctive look

219
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Okay

220
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
It look like that

221
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
It look like that

222
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Didn't look like bacteria

223
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
It's like wait a minute

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
You could this be a virus

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,447
This would be like in maybe like finding an enormous soccer ball

226
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
In the woods

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Yes to he's found the

228
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
The Leviathan equivalent

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Virus

230
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
Right it didn't make sense it was good it was kind of crazy

231
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,991
In that microscopic round to say maybe this is a vine

232
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Wait to dinner

233
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
To Brad Mumford what's his name again

234
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Timothy rowbotham

235
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Rowbotham

236
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Didn't have this

237
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Realization

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
He hadn't looked at it closely enough

239
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
He looked at it

240
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
But he just didn't somehow put that pussy

241
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,959
Did this is a virus and click Formosa Tuesday Wednesday

242
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
And it's

243
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,615
If it's likely that other people were looking at the same things in years before

244
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
I'm thinking there bacteria

245
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
Here's a big fear something the size of bacteria

246
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,879
Because viruses are always small then they that you wouldn't think of

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Spell viruses

248
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Are always small in the sense that

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
They were discovered because they were small

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,679
The basic design what scientist did was they they discovered viruses by filtering

251
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,751
Fluid from a sick plant or sick animal

252
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,847
Through a filter porcelain actually and it was so small that that

253
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,199
Anything the size of bacteria got trapped in the porcelain and anything smaller

254
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
And lo and behold I could find things that could cause sickness

255
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
In that fluid

256
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Cast of the film

257
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,719
What's the discovery of viruses meant he was innately small because that's how you feel

258
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
That's what they were looking

259
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,375
So they were probably Generations the scientists who were looking in through microscopes

260
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Saw some interesting around saying and assumed it was

261
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Is bacteria and was probably a virus

262
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
F*** is this giant

263
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
Giant Leviathan

264
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Virus

265
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
I seen that was his question

266
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,015
Well I mean would that he first he had to really establish that it wasn't so what happened was that

267
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,135
I'm eating look very closely at it and kind of work at its chemistry

268
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
And the more I looked at it

269
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
The more

270
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
It look like a virus he started

271
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Abdul

272
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,607
Start acting looking at its DNA which hadn't been possible before

273
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
Turned out that its DNA resemble

274
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
The DNA viruses not have any known

275
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Bacteria

276
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
I didn't have

277
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
I didn't actually didn't have the the the

278
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Equipment for making fuel inside of it

279
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
And

280
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Then the real kicker was that

281
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
He found out how to grow it

282
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
What he had to do was he had to stick

283
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
This thing inside of

284
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Amoeba

285
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,767
And then out of the ameba will come

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Laura Bradford caucus

287
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Just like a virus

288
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Exactly like a virus so you need to change the name for Bradford Cox

289
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
This is something else so they named it meme

290
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Mimi viral virus

291
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Because they were in France and memes

292
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
In the in a French Opera

293
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
He was mimicking

294
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Yeah

295
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
Mini Me

296
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Is that like a French word for Mac

297
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,255
I think I just took another beginning of mimic and added it to virus

298
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
I guess it's the same thing twice meme

299
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
I get it

300
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Yeah

301
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
So this so

302
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
This is what I mean this was really bizarre when they published

303
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
The report on this in 2000

304
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
Three men people really scratch your head because

305
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,759
Remember you no ordinary viruses have you know maybe 10 jeans

306
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
This one had a 1018 GMC

307
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
When you have 10 jeans go to the gene site so you have a protein capsule

308
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
So you can

309
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
Swim Tuesday so when you land on the soil you can borrow in

310
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
And then explodes

311
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Make baby

312
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
It's not much to being a virus than just

313
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Need a few genes for that

314
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,687
Does this thing have particular talents that the other viruses didn't have

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
It's okay well so what's one thing that's really interesting is

316
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
What happens when it goes inside

317
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Host

318
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
An amoeba

319
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
It goes in

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
But instead of

321
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Kind of

322
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Shutting off that protein coat and just

323
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Spilling out its contents it actually goes in

324
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
And

325
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Stays

326
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
As it was

327
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
Mainstays lights

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
It's called a virus Factory

329
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Once it's inside there their they're

330
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
It's this thing they call the virus Factory

331
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
And it basically is able to

332
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
To do

333
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Things

334
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
Vino components come into it and then

335
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
Then it was her work it has enzymes that can

336
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Refashion them and then they

337
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
Outcome the components for new job starts going to the nucleus of the already existing cell

338
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
So interesting so it it it wouldn't you like to know

339
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,151
It sucks up some stuff and yeah it has it's beautiful sort of they called a Stargate

340
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
Because it's shaped like it's a doorway shaped like a

341
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Estar and things come in and then

342
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
And then I have another Stargate

343
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
They Ducati desert manufactured things come out and then in the Sally assemble into new job

344
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Giant viruses

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,607
It spits out the raw materials and then self-assemble into a giant

346
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
A giant Leviathan no baby how did they get out of the

347
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Do they explode to the surface

348
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
They did not blow out

349
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Yeah that's like a totally that's a totally different name into the machine

350
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
It's already there cuz their parents

351
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Use the living thing

352
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
This thing is I have a weird kind of

353
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Respect for the

354
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
Oh yeah it's it's amazing and you don't want the amazing things about it is that

355
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
It can get its own virus

356
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,935
It gets there are

357
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,799
Call Vero sages and they actually go into the virus Factory

358
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
And high jacket

359
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
Intercity outcome Vera face

360
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,223
Oh wow yes soon as he live virus Factory that's what a virus want

361
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
Now the virus has its own virus Factory was going to get

362
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,135
It's going viral viral

363
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Right

364
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Weird

365
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Back that weird is the right word I say

366
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
Write notes on 2003 you know you could say well this is one weird virus

367
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
But these are just as well I wonder what else there is

368
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
It's like

369
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
Did that score the basic so they said okay Scott all this extra genetic

370
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Power

371
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,711
But he's doing this sort of special circus act here it's building its own Factory

372
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
And it's just

373
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
Behaving differently, so maybe it just needs all those jeans to do this

374
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Special things to me

375
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
How much is it when they looked at these you know 2018 jeans most of them didn't match anything anyone at found before

376
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Your new jeans

377
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
Jeans yet that you couldn't even guess at what they were at this is got to be

378
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
We from life is like

379
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Aliens from Saturn

380
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Is that where you driving with the story

381
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
Not quite but I still waiting so they look at all the G they look at the the chemistry of

382
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
Like this as it's no namae don't find any matches for this little thing

383
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
For most of the genes they couldn't find a match

384
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Yeah you can look at it I mean what is it what is this and where does it come from cuz it doesn't seem to

385
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
I have the smell of of Earth life

386
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Yeah I got that it uses DNA

387
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
I mean it is has protein and uses our chemistry but it's it's

388
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Doing something

389
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
And so these scientists said well okay they looked in in English

390
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Hospital

391
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Meowth water

392
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
Cooling tower let's go look at one here in France

393
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
And they looked

394
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,111
And they found another giant virus which is even bigger than the one that they

395
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,719
Already found

396
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,583
She says this is a cooling tower phenomenon of our rooftop biology

397
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,703
Well it's excitement Galore it's more like the drunk looking for the keys under the lamp

398
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
You know

399
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
It's like

400
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,383
You know that openness wherever you look there that we know that we know there was viruses found in one

401
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,199
Water tower so let's go look in another water tower

402
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Like that's our safest bet

403
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,855
And hey we found an even bigger one you know which they

404
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,975
Which even bigger it was even bigger yet so instead of 1018 jeans it had

405
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
1059 jeans

406
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
So they named this one Mama virus

407
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:47,263
Mimi's first cousin Mama Mimi didn't do it was

408
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
Did it also build a virus Factory so it's like so there's something there's a common theme here we

409
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,479
Ready to die of two giant viruses doing the same thing

410
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
Dennis the whole Stargate and everything

411
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Oh yeah

412
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
What's weird is that you know the mama virus has a bunch of genes that Mimi virus doesn't have

413
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
So it's like

414
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
And again don't match anything

415
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
So I don't know what to do

416
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
Some of them look like they're involved in

417
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Building proteins

418
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
Which doesn't make any sense because viruses are not supposed to do that

419
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
So it's it's this is all completely confusing

420
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
But then they said okay

421
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
Maybe we need to kind of get away from the whole body

422
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
It's our thing and you don't widen our little will you go back to the opposite of a water tower would be like the bottle

423
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,255
Bottom of a well or is it or do you go to a library and look in the interior of

424
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Old

425
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Parchment books

426
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,375
Now you start looking at places like new look

427
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
You look in the ocean

428
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
Or you looking sediment

429
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
Or you look inside animals

430
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
More or you

431
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
Look in the soil and

432
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
They start

433
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Finding

434
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
Giant viruses over and over and over again

435
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
Really yeah in all those places

436
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
Emmanuel inside of animals like in animals tummies or something

437
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,975
Yeah so they they went to

438
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
Disease researchers went to Brazil

439
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
And said let's go

440
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Look at animals

441
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Can find giant viruses

442
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
And they found a new species in

443
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
Cows and they found a new species living inside of

444
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
A monkey

445
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,615
And these were where they finding giant or giant virus

446
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,479
Are the numbers of genes are going up and up and keep finding new record breaker

447
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
So so the

448
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
The biggest one right now

449
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Is called megabox

450
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
The summer movie

451
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,631
I mean there's

452
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
In the world

453
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
In a world

454
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,567
Trackosaurus you know I was like this is like I I'm wondering what they're going to do

455
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
As I keep finding bigger ones

456
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Because you keep my having to find support

457
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
Where was Mega founded

458
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
Mega I believe was found in the ocean

459
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
And how many genes does Mega have

460
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
Mega

461
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Has

462
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
1120

463
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
Okay so where is not actually the biggest

464
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
It don't have the most genes but it's not actually the physically the biggest

465
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Giant virus

466
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Which was

467
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
So this is this one is called a Pandora

468
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Let me guess

469
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:36,735
Clean up in a sealed box and then they opened it and will it straighten it had this bizarre

470
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Are shaped like an urn

471
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Completely nuts

472
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
There's no urn-shaped

473
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
Like crazy

474
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Nmun the urn

475
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
That remind somebody of

476
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
The myth

477
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,447
What's a Pandora's Box was actually an urn

478
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,079
I'm tired that's a very learning make you happy because they found it

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
So what they did was

480
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
Are these Russian scientist they are clapping with

481
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
Dug up

482
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Frozen tundra

483
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
That had been frozen for 30000 years

484
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
And they said let's follow this out and see what's in there

485
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
What kind of things have been asleep for thirty thousand years

486
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
Beginning of a sci-fi movie

487
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Among other things they found pets

488
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
They found pandoravirus

489
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,240
And they not only did they find it but

490
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
Cebu day when they let it warm up a bit

491
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
And then they

492
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,432
Gave it to me but at checkout they they did it

493
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
Wow and how much bigger

494
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
The first

495
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Giant virus-induced

496
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Attitude with

497
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Lego

498
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
An elephant sized Mouse

499
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Compared to that elephant size mouse how much bigger is

500
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:59,680
Maybe it's more specific Hanabi I need to look at the numbers you know

501
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Are kind of going from I don't know Elsa

502
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
What you getting

503
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
Bigger and bigger and bigger

504
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Mina pandoravirus is bigger than a lot of that

505
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Bacteria

506
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,016
These things are now being found

507
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Everywhere you look

508
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
They are incredibly common

509
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
Baby mini able to get

510
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
Giant viruses out of people

511
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Really

512
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Yeah

513
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,376
WeChat what's up where are you find them in the person in our intestines or something

514
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
I believe they

515
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Found one sample in somebody's lungs

516
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
And another sample was found in someone's blood

517
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
But it's really hard to tell whether they're

518
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Actually like actively invading us and and making us sick

519
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
And maybe

520
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
7 rating amoebas they can

521
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
Invade human cells

522
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Comedian human sellers

523
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
Surprisingly similar

524
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,536
Or is it just kind of along for the ride with some amoeba that

525
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Infect us

526
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
Or does it kind of drift in and when people are sick their defenses are down

527
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,776
No we don't know if giant viruses have anything to do with human disease but

528
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,664
Let me know if you have a category problem here and there if you've got a giant

529
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Virus that

530
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
Virus like in its General

531
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Shell

532
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
But it's making proteins it's got a

533
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Bunch of jeans

534
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,000
Viruses don't have your already bigger than some bacteria should we call it as its own set

535
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
At this point

536
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
That's what people are arguing about

537
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
Right now I mean keep that line between viruses and cellular life and just put the Giant

538
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Viruses with the viruses

539
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
Or do we kind of

540
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
Blair the line Abyss feels like it's on its way from one category to the other so that's one of the big questions

541
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
What way did this thing

542
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Go and Emmylou

543
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
What's that mean

544
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Well

545
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
How do you get a job

546
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,672
Like how do you how do you well that and so

547
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
So

548
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Will get to the

549
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Henschel answer

550
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Answer to that question

551
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
China's totally fast

552
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
After the

553
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
Hi there this is Kirsten recording from Orlando Florida Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan

00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

557
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,112
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

558
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:31,232
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

559
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
And I request

560
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

561
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
About what we're calling tiny moments

562
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,336
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something

563
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kid

564
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

565
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Do you

566
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,720
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

567
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:07,840
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

568
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

569
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
It doesn't have anything to do with a test if you have a story

570
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
T-shirt with us

571
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,408
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

572
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
Record a short audio message for us

573
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
And that's where you're at. Org / brilliance

574
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Thank you so much

575
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,240
AJ Radiolab so William return to our conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer

576
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
What's an unedited conversation

577
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
And we were talking about

578
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Giant

579
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Virus

580
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
And what

581
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
They can teach us about life which really starts with a simpler Quest

582
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
Like where the hell they come

583
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
How do you get a giant fire

584
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Like how do you

585
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
How do you well that and so-so

586
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
One clue comes from those jeans

587
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,744
So now that they're finding more Marty giant viruses

588
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,376
They're defining enough variety of them they can they can look for a service and some

589
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
Common genes that they share some some

590
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,752
Common mutations in genes and their finding actually that that

591
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,080
Looks like giant viruses might actually belong to one

592
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Lineage

593
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,688
They're cousins they have a common ancestor

594
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Yasso the tribe

595
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
And if that's if that's

596
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
True it could be an incredibly old tribe

597
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,928
These these giant viruses could be a lineage

598
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,536
Conceivably that you know goes all the way back to you know the early stages of

599
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
The dawn

600
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,728
I really owe like a black back to the very beginning of life on Earth

601
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
2 that are right yeah

602
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
I mean maybe

603
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
When

604
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
Cellular life was getting started

605
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
But the question is what were the giant viruses like then

606
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
Now some people have said well no giant viruses actually started his teeny tiny viruses and they've just been like

607
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Gathering up new jeans

608
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
Through Time

609
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
I'm just been getting bigger and bigger bigger

610
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
But

611
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
You know number the people who actually study giant viruses and it really you know

612
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
Help us understand the most they're saying no we don't think so

613
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
We actually think that

614
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
These things

615
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Started out

616
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
As

617
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Cellular life

618
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
They were cells

619
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Are full-blown sales

620
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,088
You mean they were from the other side of the roadway where the cellular life. They switch

621
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
The Heights

622
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
So yeah they change teams

623
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
How to know that

624
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:46,304
Like I can't have a plant that becomes an animal how did they sedate

625
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
Started off as like what we would call

626
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Call creatures

627
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
And then they started actually alive

628
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,568
You know they think they re standing out there in the air the water or the

629
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
Grounder like some free living microbes

630
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:07,808
Yeah and then why would you go demote yourself this is this is your problem with Paras

631
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Websites you keep saying mean things about parasite

632
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
I had a choice

633
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,936
It's between being Ace intake having my own integrity and choosing to make a living on my own or just

634
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Suck love you I would just live on my own

635
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
Excuse me for I know you like parasites

636
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,432
Do not use that that passage is a recording play it's already been cut

637
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,136
So wait a second so you recording to this Theory you have a man's true nevertheless

638
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
We have a microbe that is

639
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
That is

640
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
Doing its thing and then something happened

641
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Okay what is the something

642
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
It becomes a parasite

643
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Becomes apparent

644
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,520
You know maybe a symbiont here basically what it does is it starts living inside

645
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Another

646
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,896
So you need gives up its Integrity as in as a as a free

647
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Life

648
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,272
Former free-standing life whatever that means

649
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
It's got a

650
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Shell

651
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
What kind of border

652
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
It's making its own energy

653
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
It's

654
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
Replicating in the way that

655
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
Let the beginning at the beginning at the beginning it can make its own energy

656
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:25,376
You can grow it can divide and do all the things that living things to do and then for some reason it chooses

657
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
2

658
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Require

659
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,544
Some other creatures existence for its own it has it has to

660
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,872
Become dependent on some other organism

661
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
For it's very very exist

662
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,272
Well it's flip it the other way and say it discovers a wonderful new home

663
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Inside of another cell

664
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
It comes in as I got like I love leaving my Park Avenue apartment for a dark cave

665
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
Exciting opportunities real estate

666
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Imagine you're like Bear Grylls

667
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Okay let's imagine

668
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
You are like

669
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,080
Hiking around and killing your own food okay II

670
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
Let's just try to picture that's okay Robert.

671
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,320
You're you're getting your dear you're starting your own fires you're going on and on and on and you do that for

672
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
For like a few years

673
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
And then

674
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,512
And you're walking through the jungle and I'm very very skinny not going well

675
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
College that the Haggard Hunter

676
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
Let's say you're doing this in Minnesota

677
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
All right sounds like cold

678
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Okay

679
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
And then suddenly like

680
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:37,056
You you get there's a break in the forest and you come across a

681
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Giant

682
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,152
Mansion what is this place and you open the door

683
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
And inside

684
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
There's like conveyor belt

685
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,296
Swell ice cream and steak

686
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
You know and end their slippers waiting for you and you know anything you need it

687
00:30:54,464 --> 00:31:00,096
It's somebody else is taking care of it there is one thing you left out when I walk into this Magical Kingdom is it

688
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
Doesn't let me out I can't leave

689
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,520
Ever again because I am become so dependent on its natural wonders

690
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
But I lose my Independence my integrity

691
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
Have a very very things I walked in with

692
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
We did literally

693
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Music

694
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,808
We did and I did point out to you at the

695
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
The time that

696
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
You are quite

697
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Dependent on

698
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Are there species

699
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
Do you want me to bring us

700
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
Weather Stacy episode 32

701
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
It has eyes will roll right out of their sockets

702
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,128
It sounds like becoming big being able to take advantage of another cell

703
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,736
Evolutionarily speaking is is a great way to go

704
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Because

705
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
You have all these things taken care of for you

706
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Now

707
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
According to this

708
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Siri these days

709
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
Mysterious ancient

710
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Microbes

711
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
Started going into these cells

712
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
And reproducing there and then

713
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
Going out again and then finding another host cell to info

714
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
Are they making like were they making their host sick

715
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
Probably yeah

716
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Probably because giant viruses are not good

717
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,248
To get to see this is this complicates your Mansion metaphor

718
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
Tiny bit because what it means is that you go in the conveyor belts when you feeding yourself and having a good time but then you're filled starts to

719
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
Muck up the place and it starts to collapse from within that doesn't sound

720
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
The Strain the metaphor bad boy

721
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Goy

722
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,936
Rob Roy

723
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,080
So so you you spend some time in this wonderful Mansion you you rest it's warm it's comfortable so on you you you

724
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
You eat

725
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
Bullet with your filth

726
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
You start a family

727
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
You know

728
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,272
And then I'll send you and your descendants

729
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
You know

730
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,696
Leave the Mansion the messages collapses from all the damage you did do it

731
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
But you know actually you see in the distance there's another mansion

732
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,120
Just go over there now you feel like rested and ready and like you have it all we got to do is get over there

733
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:14,496
So let's just go that we don't have to we don't have to stop to to kill a deer we just go to that next mansion

734
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
The ice cream is waiting

735
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
I still got to walk

736
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
So I need my legs

737
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
So to speak to the next mansion

738
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,784
But I don't need the powerful muscles that I would have needed to kill the deer I can let you know so you don't need

739
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
You need

740
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
You know let's say that you were you know

741
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
You don't even need the knowledge

742
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,232
I've had to kill a deer we blind dumb

743
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Fat

744
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Zodiac where you end up

745
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,216
They get rid of they start getting rid of these jeans

746
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
And how does that happen

747
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,152
You know a random mutation comes along and just cuts out a bit of DNA them you're fine

748
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Yeah

749
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
That's okay I needed a moment worth

750
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
Oh there goes a big chunk of me

751
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
I don't need that

752
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,624
I did that the regular kind of mutation

753
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
That happens all the time

754
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,488
Turn your your your successor

755
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Being

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Travels with lighter

757
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
I was able to succeed just as well

758
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,656
Right so you know if if if if

759
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:21,056
You know it if we are born you know which was a part of our DNA that's deleted that had some you know

760
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
Hemoglobin genes in it like

761
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Good night

762
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
Like that bad and mean

763
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,016
But you know but if you cut out a gene

764
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
That

765
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
This giant virus no longer needs because

766
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
It's got everything Supply to it

767
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
And it's host

768
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
Find self

769
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
The check that check it out so you have this

770
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,584
So the idea is that you did these viruses

771
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
The giant viruses but they actually

772
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
And

773
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,776
Did Eddie Eddie how fast does a giant like these

774
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
Imagining

775
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Back

776
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
In the beginning

777
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,224
There was there was not Mega not Jai nobody likes

778
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
Cellular near me

779
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Joy's Independence

780
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
Size-wise it's a

781
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Blimp

782
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
It's a massive thing

783
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
And then suddenly starts to shrink

784
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
I bit by bit by bit

785
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
What at what rate does it

786
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Start to shrink and shut itself

787
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Well

788
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
It could be that

789
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
These

790
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Giant viruses were finding

791
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
These giant viruses that scientist

792
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Are finding

793
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,712
Could be shrinking very very very slowly

794
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Could be

795
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
That

796
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
There are other viruses

797
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
That made this transition that

798
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Tranq faster

799
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
So maybe

800
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Maybe

801
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,888
The race to the bottom maybe some some maybe some tiny viruses are just

802
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
Former giant viruses

803
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,080
That just shrink relief at least to the bottom it's just a different way of thinking about life you

804
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
You generally assume

805
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
Being a multicellular organism yourself

806
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
That little things

807
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
In some deep sense

808
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
You know you're not supposed to say this

809
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Want to be big

810
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
You don't want to

811
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
I know

812
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,536
I know but most people unlike you a****** most people

813
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
Think they're better than the podcast it's better to be more complex than to be simple but

814
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
Hear you're talking about a different Voyage all together

815
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,592
It might just work out for you to be simple rather than complex

816
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:38,528
Well given the dead viruses are insanely abundant on this planet I mean there are

817
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
By some estimates

818
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
10

819
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
To the 31st power viruses on Earth

820
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
Think about that like it's a it's a

821
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
You know it's a 1 with 31 zeros

822
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
I mean

823
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
Inconceivable

824
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
How many viruses are on

825
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
It's their world

826
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
So

827
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
Apparently you know Nature has not agreed

828
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
What is interesting like thinking about how

829
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
How

830
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Lifeguard

831
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Smaller

832
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,784
Simpler

833
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
If it's true that this trajectory is a

834
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
SS

835
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Common as you say that

836
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
That thing start out sometimes

837
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Start up big and then

838
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,304
Learn to live inside other things and in the process get smaller and smaller

839
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
I want smaller in this is actually maybe

840
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
What happens to a lot of viruses not just some viruses

841
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
It anyway it gives the virus and honorable history

842
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't know why I feel that way

843
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
This boy isn't going to

844
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,504
I don't know but then I mean

845
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Abandonment

846
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
Reliving past right

847
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,672
They gave in to The Temptations of the Mansion full of

848
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Steak and ice cream

849
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,768
It's true but I've always assumed in this is

850
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Not

851
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Not

852
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Something wanted

853
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Seem that viruses were

854
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
A kind of Proto organism

855
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
They Were Somehow at the beginning of something and I never quite got going

856
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
Yeah but this is you're actually saying that these viruses are

857
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,616
In a way at the end

858
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
At the end but there at the

859
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
I don't know how to quite use the words that I want to use

860
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
The snakes feel something at the end of something out of the beginning

861
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,160
Like you just took that you just took what I consider to be the beginning

862
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
And you've now made it then

863
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
And end

864
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,560
An end that's interesting I never

865
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
Yeah. So I can go in different directions

866
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
And how far can a Traverse

867
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Journey

868
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Go I mean can you go from like

869
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
How big did that

870
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
It was never liked

871
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Turtle with

872
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
With a with things

873
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
All right now

874
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Like a giant dinosaur

875
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
No

876
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
Sorry I know there are things going I believe they're going to mixes Owens

877
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Which

878
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
Started out as free living animals

879
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
And have become

880
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,816
Parasites and they're just down to just a few cell

881
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Hay Day

882
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,728
Myxozoa animals you don't mean animals in the way that animals

883
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,080
My pet my pet jellyfish

884
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
Really really

885
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
So you're saying a jellyfish size

886
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,528
Thing has now reduced itself to a tiny Speck microscopic parasite

887
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Get the

888
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
I don't even say it because you can't do it if you're that small

889
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
That's insane

890
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Andrea Lee

891
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Like it going from something you can see and would want to avoid while swimming

892
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,144
Down to something that you might even just breathing without even knowing it

893
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
You blowing my mind

894
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Shrinking

895
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Mixes

896
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
Message

897
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
How do you spell that

898
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Myx

899
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Xxio 8

900
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm trying in my mind to construct a scenario where we

901
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Like the mixes on

902
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Could begin to shed

903
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,464
Like if we were living inside then like not the iPhone with the eye

904
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
IHome

905
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,328
The IUD you know but the but the fact is that we can all we have

906
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
Cast aside some things

907
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
You know what a weak acid

908
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
Well we can't smell better I know that

909
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,568
I know that'll better and we used to be able to make her own vitamin C in our own bodies

910
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
Our own bodies were vitamin C Factor

911
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Really

912
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
Wait what what change that

913
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
How did we want to let go that it sounds great

914
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,600
Sunshine vitamin C vitamin C

915
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,952
Well if you are sitting around eating fruit all

916
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Fruit which is loaded invited

917
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
AMC

918
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Then

919
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,888
If you get a mutation on your vitamin C Gene well

920
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:43,264
Yep you're fine cuz you're you you're getting your vitamin C from somewhere else you don't feel that lack

921
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,616
You don't start getting scurvy because

922
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Feeding yourself on fruit and then

923
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
That mutated Gene May then spread out and end up

924
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
Being and every member of your species

925
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,928
What seems to happen to us I mean you can literally Lexi like these we have these broken vitamin C G

926
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
So sometimes we trying to yeah

927
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
Okay so there you have it a raw conversation with

928
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
Science writer Carl Zimmer about

929
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Shrinking

930
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Shrinkage in life

931
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
No usually would have these conversations

932
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
Cuz you just talkin and cuz you don't really have like the encyclopedia sitting right next to you you get a lot of a little things wrong

933
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
Deals with facts names dates whatever

934
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,704
And then you know you fact check it later

935
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,080
So In fairness to Carl as we're fact-checking we gave him the chance to listen back to the raw conversation

936
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Make a couple of amendments

937
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
This is fact Checker Carl

938
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
Scolding rambling Karl

939
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,391
Okay we were saying that

940
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
This microbiologist Tim rowbotham took a sample to France but actually it was another microbiologist

941
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
Turtles that did it

942
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,447
Small but important sorry Richard

943
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
And Mama virus turns out to have a thousand 23g

944
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,407
Then I started talking about virus

945
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
At the time in 2011 it was indeed

946
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,759
The biggest virus known

947
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
1120 games

948
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,159
Okay however there was in 2013

949
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
A another virus found

950
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,607
Called pandoravirus now I was saying that this was something found the temperature in tundra wrong

951
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:49,471
This was on the ocean and this virus

952
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Has

953
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
A whole lot of jeans how many

954
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Ed has

955
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,479
2500 2500 I mean that's way more than a lot of bacteria

956
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,879
Also a certain point in we to refer to Pandora viruses being the biggest virus in size

957
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
I see that that stinks you go to

958
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Hippo virus

959
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,071
The house it seems that since we talked as evidence that there might be a couple separate

960
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Lineages of giant viruses

961
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
One may have evolved

962
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,287
From Big to small as we talked about but another one might have gone in the usual direction from small to big

963
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
There's one last thing that I see so apparently apparently I didn't quite spell metazoan correct

964
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
This is how you spell mixes on my xoz oan apparently I missed one of those

965
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
I can't remember

966
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,535
I mean I would be lying if I said I didn't think a little bit less of you

967
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,935
Okay xtro back in

968
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
Petco's in to Radiolab people interviewing stupid people

969
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
That's funny

970
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
That's a great taglines

971
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Hugo okay

972
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,111
That's our new tagline

973
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135
Thanks for listening

974
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:17,535
Is James Jordan from Tulsa Oklahoma Radiolab is produced by Jed Adam Rod or staff includes burner

975
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,935
Farrell ellenhorn David Gable Dylan Keith Matt kielty Andy Mills Latif Nasser and Kelsey Padgett area

976
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,335
John wack Molly Webster Soren wheeler and Jamie York with help from Damiana marchetti Molly McBride Jacob

00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
Gibson & Alexandra Lee Young

978
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,455
Fact Checkers are Eva Dasher and Michelle Harris
