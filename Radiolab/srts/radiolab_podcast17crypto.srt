1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,792
Are you awake

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,728
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,592
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,016
Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I Molly Webster this is Radiolab

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Robert krulwich will be back with us soon

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:30,464
Today a story for you well I guess I was just thinking I should probably tell you just

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000
Morgan and I back

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:37,632
Story of how I heard about the story so Morgan and I went to grad school together at NYU

9
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,448
So I guess I've known her for almost 11 years

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,288
Okay and where were were holed up in my apartment

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,104
I don't know this is like no last November something

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Comes over

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,992
Sitting on the giant I've big floor pillow like a Turkish floor pillow

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Course you do

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Sitting on the floor pillow

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
And then she is like

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Already hear the story

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
And I said yeah and she's like okay need you take the battery out of your phone

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
Really yeah and I actually said that

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
I can't take the battery out of it and she goes

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,520
Okay I need you to power down and put it in another room under a pillow

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
What

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
I was like what is going on in shoe and then if I disappoint she's taking the battery out of her phone so I

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,808
I do it I put it in the in my bedroom and I put it under pillows I

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
Turned it off I came back and sat down

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,464
And then she starts telling me essentially about the ceremony

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
About going to the launch of this new

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Currency

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Which involved her flying across the country to live in a hotel room for a number of days

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
A bunch of strangers and then something happened because she came back seemingly paranoid

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
At least she was hiding phones under pillows

32
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,464
It takes a few steps to start with step one which is

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Which is Morgan

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
I Morgen pek

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
How would you identify yourself

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Professionally

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
Professionally I'm a freelance journalist

38
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
And my eyes Morgan has become like

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,616
The historian of the world of digital money I started reading about neuroscience

40
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
I quickly found out about Bitcoin about a year into my writing

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
2011 and has pretty much been running ever since

42
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Now yes a lot of people when they hear about digital money they think

43
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,816
650 Euros paid in Bitcoin currency

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
Obviously it has become associated with cybercrime

45
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Stephen Morgan

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,056
What attracted her to this whole world of meter go my God this thing is amazing

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
She's like pulled in by the idealism of it there was an extremely active community of people who were talking

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
About

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
You know

50
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,600
Completely subverting the financial system at a time

51
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
When the financial system was

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
Not trusted and was clapping

53
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
Because Morgan says the birth of Bitcoin goes back to

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Well

55
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Never 2008 boom was the big

56
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Implosion in September the stock market crashed the banks bailed

57
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Bears are standing there watching in amazement I don't blame him I'm believable

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
This shakes your trust in American institutions

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
And then just a few months later 2009 January the Hot Topic

60
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Digital money

61
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Call Nick Quinn showed up after the big collapse

62
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,312
It was after and it was very much response to that definitely

63
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Cuz he was as currency that was decentralized

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
Which means it's Ron and monitored by all the people who use it which means you don't need a federal

65
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Is there a Uso at the beginning a lot of people sell Bitcoin is a way to sort of

66
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Take the power back from The Big Bang so I had just everybody over Libertarians were really into it they thought that

67
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
It was going to

68
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
Rash that it was going to crumble The Columns of

69
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
Every Power structure in you know

70
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,103
The world obviously that didn't happen it did not take down the worlds

71
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,455
But Bitcoin is not going away it's been a decade it still around

72
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
But if you talk to people on the inside

73
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,111
Will tell you one of the things that has dog Bitcoin from the beginning

74
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
Is this issue of privacy

75
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
The weight of the

76
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Technology works

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Is that

78
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
It tracks every single transaction

79
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Does ever

80
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Maid on the network

81
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Anytime anyone with a Bitcoin buys

82
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Coffee

83
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Start pound of heroin

84
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
That transaction is capital

85
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
In something called the public Ledger Bitcoin is a ledger public Ledger

86
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
It's out there for anyone to see

87
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
Really every single transaction has ever been done

88
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Private at all

89
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
But people thought it was Private beginning because over using these pseudonyms another words in The Ledger you never see anyone's actual

90
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
There no names on in the car

91
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
Like I wouldn't be my only had bt9 572 problem is it

92
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Well

93
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
There are no names attached

94
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
The behavior is out there

95
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
For anyone to see

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Turns out

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
It's really not that hard to match

98
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Dislike string of characters

99
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
With the person that it represents out in the real world

100
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,255
You could just kind of Google it on the internet see if it pops up anywhere else what is associated with

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
And then you got to figure out who the person is

102
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
And then you can go back into the Bitcoin Ledger and search their entire history can figure out all their big

103
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,591
Business dealings all their personal dealings who they know who they don't know possibly who their bank is

104
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
And you know people have tried to solve this problem with big

105
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
But companies now

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,599
And actually specialize in doing a network analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain and they do it for companies who want to

107
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
Make sure that they're not transacting with you know criminals people who have had

108
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
Delete trying to D Anonymous people

109
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
Wow

110
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
And so one of the puzzles that

111
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
All the internet people think about

112
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Is

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,175
Is there a way to get the best of both worlds can you have the decentralization that comes with

114
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Digital money

115
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
But can you also get privacy

116
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Almost like cash a dollar bill out of my pocket I walk down the street I give it to someone they give to some

117
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Can trace that money

118
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
Can you get the decentralization that comes with digital money and can you wrap that up with

119
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
The Privacy that you get with paper money not question

120
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Testing testing

121
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,407
Brings up to this guy zooko Wilcox

122
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
Zuko and I'm in a different room

123
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
He is our master of

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
The ceremony I have to say you do

125
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
Everyone's like pretty excited on talking to a guy named Zuko like

126
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
It's just a good name Zuko

127
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
Zuko

128
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Zuko is digital currencies for extremely dry

129
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Is a charismatic leader type of thing

130
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Yes but I was concerned about the Privacy applications because he's a pretty hardcore

131
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
It's like worlds upon worlds are opening for a cypherpunks

132
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
People that care deeply about

133
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,887
How to make the internet more private human right and that it's

134
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,703
Necessary condition

135
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
For the exercise of a free choice

136
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
Morality and of political participation

137
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,223
And of everything that's of intimacy everything that's most important as humans

138
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
So this whole thing with Bitcoin in the Privacy problem

139
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Right up his alley

140
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
So I went out of my way to study the Bitcoin source code and

141
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Contributed some

142
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Suggestions and

143
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Yes I immediately started

144
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Fantasizing about what could be better

145
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
So then he

146
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
Being like the Privacy security cypherpunk

147
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,847
Gorilla becomes the leader of something called zika

148
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
NZ cash

149
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Really it's mean

150
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
Contribution to this ecosystem is privacy

151
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
So there's this thing called zero knowledge proof

152
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Okay and it's a mathematical invention that

153
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Mathematicians who come up with it requires something called the Z snark parameters to be baked in

154
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Into the protocol

155
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
I asked

156
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Hours of questions

157
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
And it got me into conversation about circles and graphs

158
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
Send the shape of numbers is the shape of what's a possibility of

159
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Was that

160
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,199
It allows you to prove that something is true

161
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,063
Without revealing anything about the thing you're trying to prove is true

162
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Well you just

163
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
Take van to run Computer Science and Mathematics start

164
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Overlapping to Wizardry here

165
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
All you need to know is it's zcash promises to give you decentralisation with the psych

166
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Buffet at 5

167
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Messi

168
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Zcash has its own flocked unfortunate vulnerability in the math

169
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,111
In order to create the currency of zcash you have to first create a number certain

170
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
Enormous number and then you use that number to do a

171
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,815
Bunch of math and then like boom

172
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
You have the currency

173
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
But it all starts

174
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
With this number this key

175
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Problem with that

176
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
In this system

177
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
In this system

178
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
If somebody got a hold of the private key they could counterfeit C CashPoints

179
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
They could counterfeit money just making it

180
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Millions and millions and millions of newpointe that's a really big problem

181
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,423
You have a Anonymous currency cuz no one would ever know

182
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Bitcoin and it's a public Ledger you can actually see if there's any funny business going on that

183
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,967
Actually why they keep it open right the lack of privacy and Bitcoin is a security measure but you're no one would ever know

184
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
So the challenges how do you get people to buy into a system that has this like

185
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Major vulnerability

186
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
I'll be at just right at the very beginning there's this one moment where

187
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
You know you have to trust people

188
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
In a way that's

189
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Completely

190
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
Existentially defining of the currency

191
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
So this is what zukas up again

192
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
How do I

193
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
If I want super privacy what she does

194
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
How do I

195
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Generate this number in such a way

196
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
That

197
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,551
No one steals it not me not anyone else and how do I

198
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,927
To all of the people that might want to use zcash later than in the

199
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
Tiny little window of

200
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
Of creation nothing untoward has happened.

201
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
That the number is never been tampered with it

202
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
Human eyes have never been laid upon if you know that the entire creation of the system remains

203
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Pure

204
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
Is it this is very much like an Immaculate Conception

205
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
You're like

206
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
No humans can have sex to make this baby but I need to be a baby

207
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,623
Examine the act of sex to make sure that there is no physical contact

208
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
Is it like that that's so good okay so here we are

209
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Zuko designs

210
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Will have

211
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Ceremony

212
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,031
Most secure most sophisticated cryptographic ceremony that's ever been performed

213
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
Okay

214
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
Here's the thing while it's trivial to make your own currency

215
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:41,343
It is not trivial to inspire

216
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
That's what money is is the agreement between people to use it

217
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
And honor that

218
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,655
Yourself a contract and the creation of value to me that's like Alchemy

219
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
And at the moment of creation walking down the street

220
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Near you Mali Greenpoint

221
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
And I get a text message on Signal

222
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
A private messenger app from Zuko that's like

223
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
Pay we want you to be want you to

224
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Be there

225
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Since you're so excited

226
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,607
Is chosen did you even know what you were being invited to now I had no I

227
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
No idea but I was like I have to do this I mean

228
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
I cannot miss this

229
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,079
Even if zcash doesn't make it even if you know it collapses

230
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,151
It seems like a historical

231
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Moments

232
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Suzuka basically said just

233
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
Wait for our back call

234
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
So about two weeks later

235
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,439
The back call come to the coffee store in Boulder

236
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,303
Soap Morgan gets on a flight to Denver Rent-A-Car to Boulder and go to the coffee shop goes there

237
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
Standing next to the Barista counter and actually

238
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
He has a huge

239
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Paper map

240
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
With him

241
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,799
Spread all over like the Baristas area he's like up in their Grill

242
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,199
And this other guy not showed up who was going to film it up

243
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
Was that was that for you you wanted everything recorded

244
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
And it was

245
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
To serve as a security mechanism

246
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
And documentation for the public

247
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
More on that in a sec

248
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
And then

249
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Okay

250
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
Okay they leave the coffee shop go over to Matt's van he makes us both up I told him they can make me up

251
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Then we're going to turn off all of our cell phones

252
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
So that if there were any hackers

253
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
They would be able to track

254
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Where we work physically

255
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
I'm trying to think if I have to say goodbye to anyone

256
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,759
We're like okay now we got the van we got our cell phones turned off

257
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
The next thing we need to do where we're going to the

258
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
Computer store acquire a computer

259
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
Because like if there was some hacker who is planning to steal the

260
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
They could have already planted some malware or tracking device on zukas personal laptop

261
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Before we even started

262
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
So we all piled into the van to get a clean computer

263
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
He's decided to go to Denver for this but he doesn't want to use this phone

264
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
Because what if somebody is like cracking what he's looking at that is due

265
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
During much of his recording while he's driving do you have like a black hoodie over you like his

266
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,167
Bella style so they're driving for a little bit

267
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,311
All of a sudden they make this Pit Stop we were like

268
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Hey there's a costume store in imperfect.

269
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Wizard hat wizard hat

270
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Can I see your wizard hat section

271
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
So they walk through this big costume store pass

272
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,023
Witches hats Tiaras what is the wizard that you settled on

273
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
It was a Gandalf hat Gandalf hat

274
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
Play I love the Gandalf hat that is appropriate the greatest wizard of all

275
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:16,127
And then back to the mission at hand stands Denver computer

276
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,967
We drove down using our paper map with our cell phones off to the computer store

277
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
They get their walk in a little computer shopping

278
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
Different ones

279
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,583
The computer is sacred i7 6700

280
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,423
Which henceforth is given a new name called the compute node

281
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
And why is it sacred

282
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Well because this

283
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Is the computer that will hold the secret number the number that will give birth to an entirely new

284
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Currency so

285
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
And drove to an area that has hotels that we knew of

286
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Hotels near going around to like the hotels in Boulder

287
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
Or they don't have an ethernet connection

288
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:20,639
He wasn't clear on the notion of ethernet

289
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
If you don't know what you're going to do

290
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
They don't know what they're going to do

291
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,207
I see this is actually your security measure I guess you're totally in the dark about what you're doing

292
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,047
Then some hackers they can't they can't mount an attack

293
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
It's foolproof but

294
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Eventually has rooms and hotel

295
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,383
Zuko actually Hazmat book the hotel room for two nights

296
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Do you have a key

297
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,735
We all check into one room from floor

298
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
It's not particularly

299
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,855
Fancy you got your two beds

300
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Then they set up

301
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
We're well organized machine

302
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
Bad to chill out on concentrate on

303
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,007
Uncareful observing what we did was we stripped the room of all of the

304
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,615
Lamps and the telephone everything on all counters gets

305
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
Shop somewhere over that stuff bearded way into the closet

306
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Or the bathtub in addition we didn't want like the television

307
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
For example which could be remotely controlled by an adversary

308
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
Television

309
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
Grab that table where they're going to set up the compute node explain again while you're keeping it away from the wall

310
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
There's a teeny tiny chance that a team of spies rented the room next door and set up a giant antenna

311
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
The other side of this wall this is like the dopest attacks atsuko is planning against

312
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Called side-channel attacks by which you could use an antenna

313
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047
Phone to figure out what a computer is doing for example with some crazy microphone you can listen into the computer

314
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Desert if you heard something like

315
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,191
Oh that's a Diffie Hellman key exchange

316
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Or

317
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,871
Oh yeah this is obviously figured out the full 4096 bit RSA decryption key

318
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Or

319
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
Hey that's a new babies video

320
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,807
Or whatever so please don't

321
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
Put anything on this desk from here on out

322
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
Just pulled away from the wall about

323
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
5 ft

324
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
Just in case there's somebody set up

325
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
Next door and then started loading and all the

326
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
Cameras and Equipment battery pack

327
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
Junk food but then there was also a whole security camera setup

328
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
They don't have a radio

329
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,479
For security cameras which word from the 80s before security cameras came with Wi-Fi

330
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Which means

331
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
We had to buy antique

332
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,623
Security cameras in their night vision security cameras

333
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
And they said those up

334
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,743
So that we could see the other cameras from the first camera so you could sell that new

335
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,095
Did just snuck in there in like tampered with one of the cameras during the process either

336
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,447
And this security camera setup with one of the key points in trying to

337
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Create

338
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
When Morgan was talking about earlier

339
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
The Alchemy

340
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Faith Trust

341
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Whatever

342
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
So the security mechanism this was this was going to

343
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Catch any

344
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Shenanigans

345
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,087
Inuzuka was going to post the security footage to the Internet so

346
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Security Experts

347
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Scan it and make up their minds could the ceremony be

348
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Trusted

349
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Hold on where are you going to sleep tonight

350
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
We could all cannabis sleep anywhere

351
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
So we said all that stuff up

352
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,959
It's like 9 now at 10 it was late

353
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
And

354
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,103
I took the computer that we used so-called compute node

355
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
And it from that moment forward I kept that thing

356
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Like within Arm's Reach

357
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
48 hours or so oh my God it was

358
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,672
A little bit exhausting trying to be paranoid and it was exhausting trying to be paranoid

359
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Yeah like I slept with it at night

360
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
My bed

361
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
UTEP my

362
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Cut my arm around it

363
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Goodnight sweet prince

364
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
And flights of Angels Sing thee to thy rest

365
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Coming up

366
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
This is Enrique Romero from the Border Town of Laredo Texas

367
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of scientific

368
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,560
Knowledge in the modern world more information about Sloan at www.starone.org

369
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,192
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

370
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,056
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

371
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:43,712
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

372
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

373
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,416
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

374
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kids

375
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,144
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

376
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

377
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,920
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

378
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have

379
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
Have anything to do with a test

380
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
If you have a story please share with us

381
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,792
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

382
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
And that's where you're at. Org / brilliance

383
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
Thank you so much

384
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Chad Molly Radiolab

385
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Back to Boulder

386
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
Sorry I can open the door that would be helping you

387
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
So it's the next morning

388
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,072
Zuko sits down at his personal computer and he starts making all these

389
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Hello

390
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Video chat calls

391
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,776
He calls up a guy in DC a guy in Texas

392
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
Tell you you sound like Tom Hardy also

393
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Florida

394
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Really appreciate your help

395
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
Slovenia

396
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
Drop it by another guy in California

397
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:29,952
And then there was this mysterious one has ready that was only referred to as February

398
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
Didn't know where he was

399
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
I didn't find out until afterwards

400
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,400
He was actually driving from Vancouver across

401
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
British Columbia

402
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
Who are all these guys sofra Zuko it's it's very unacceptable he wants to take as much of the

403
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
Trust me you got to trust me out of it as possible

404
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
And that's what I tried to do

405
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
It's so

406
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
Even though zukas can record all this footage put it up online later someone is going to be watching that could be like

407
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
This was a trick

408
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
It's all smoke and mirrors Magic Mike sure you say you recorded everything but maybe you manipulated the footage

409
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
You didn't even set the cameras up the way you said you did

410
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
And so

411
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
So I decided to do was get in touch with all these guys all over the world and try and decentralized distrust

412
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,432
So there were six stations security camera setup

413
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
Ready to help Zuko make

414
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,064
This big random number the private key so

415
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,904
Each of the six stations was actually creating one

416
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Piece of the ski

417
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
That way they'll be no one person that makes the entire key it'll just be these little pieces that actually won't

418
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,960
Ever come in contact with one another the idea was nobody will actually have

419
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
The kids up

420
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Hope this works

421
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
So everyone's got their compute node power down

422
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
And then

423
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
The ceremony begins

424
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
It's top secret Park

425
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
There's a special box

426
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
Here to make sure that nobody can

427
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,744
Gasser read this Secret

428
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Zuko closes the blinds

429
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
And so

430
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm going to cover my keyboard

431
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
With the special box

432
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,264
Do I take a cardboard box that one of the computer to come in

433
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,336
Sawed in half so that it was

434
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Half of a cardboard box

435
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,200
He put it over the keyboard of the compute node

436
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Freddy

437
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
And then I slid my hands under the cardboard box

438
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
And then

439
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
He starts punching in all these random letters and numbers into the computer node

440
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Cat walking across the computer

441
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Okay

442
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:53,056
And once he's done an auction on eBay

443
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
You know does it takes all those random characters and it combines it with more random characters that are generated like inside

444
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
By the computer

445
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
Until finally it creates

446
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,136
Part of the key to the other five participants had to do the same thing

447
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,208
DC made their piece of the Key Florida

448
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Texas

449
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Slovenia

450
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Canada

451
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,376
Okay so you got one key broken into six pieces and the next

452
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
Step is to get all of those pieces to work together to

453
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
Create one thing which is zcash

454
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
And you want to do this in such a way that those pieces never touch

455
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
Each other that they remain hidden

456
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
So that

457
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,504
No person could ever get their hand on the power of the whole key

458
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,208
So thank God there's convoluted math to save the day I think it's a good time to just say what was happening

459
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
3-2-1 so

460
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,656
First things first the guy in California gets on the horn

461
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,472
Play like the batting order and then

462
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
He sent a message, but go message to station one

463
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
Station one guy and his computer know do some math on his piece of the key

464
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:11,136
If you know spits out a number and then Burns it onto DVD

465
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Why DVD

466
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,816
Because all the guys at the station to ripped out the Wi-Fi in their compute node we don't want her to be able to package because

467
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,144
This by the way has a pretty cool name

468
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,496
You have a protective field basically around the computer that holds the secret

469
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
I feel

470
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
Anyway once the computer is done burning to the DVD the guy station one takes in wanted to another computer

471
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
Cuter

472
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
Uploaded to the internet and then the gas station to Peter van valkenburgh

473
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
So what happens is the software I run on my connected computer

474
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
I take the DVD out of the connected computer walk across the air gap if you will

475
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,848
Mini compute node takes that little answer combined it with Peters piece of the key and then

476
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Math

477
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,552
Sonos it Computing again you answer a bigger ass

478
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,880
Answer and then I write on a different DVD answered

479
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
Takes it out of the computer network computer uploads

480
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
Station 3 grab that can find him a little bit more of an answer than Station 4

481
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:34,080
It's the same thing

482
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
Get a little bit more the answer and just rinse wash repeat station 5-6 back to the

483
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
Top of the order

484
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,368
And throughout this entire process the individual shards of the key are kept separate

485
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
And Secret

486
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,488
Get together they're doing the math it's getting closer and closer and closer

487
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
Do the final key that will launch zcash

488
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Was there a like a

489
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,680
Peter in the air

490
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,288
No

491
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
I mean it really is

492
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Tttt tttt

493
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
You better bring a deck of cards

494
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Brunch Oakland

495
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Cool

496
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
I can juggle 3 balls

497
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
Because the thing is every one of those Mass steps

498
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Took about an hour

499
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Have they had to do like

500
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,072
3 full rotations through this order

501
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,912
So most of the weekend was just kind of sitting around

502
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
Waiting

503
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
And waiting

504
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Who's this

505
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,640
So yeah we're hanging out

506
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Good to know

507
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,552
Zuko has brought along some

508
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Pork rinds

509
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:55,232
And sour cream but he's tipping his dipping pork rinds into sour cream

510
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Also

511
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Napping

512
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
Which is the only sleeping this happen like

513
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
There's like

514
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
You know an hour here

515
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Are there

516
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
End is the hours Roll by things are going really well people are getting their math done their passing along these answers

517
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Getting closer to having their key

518
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
Maybe halfway into the process

519
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Think it

520
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
Strange

521
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
The reach lying in their beds just

522
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Kind of chilling out Morgan was just waking zuka was playing on a tablet

523
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
What

524
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,552
I groaned City to do

525
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Dorit

526
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Suzuka gets up

527
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,184
You start stalking which is

528
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
Well with my voice echoing back at me back

529
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
Feedback

530
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Started

531
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Equity

532
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
You don't like me

533
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
Incongruous noise

534
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Make it stop

535
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,320
Commuting all my mics I don't know where it's being back from

536
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
He like turns off the mic

537
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
It was like okay

538
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
Macy's down

539
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
At the Google Hangout

540
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Computer

541
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
A

542
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Tester

543
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
If this Echo comes back

544
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
If you look at the video you see

545
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
He like just

546
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Freezes

547
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
And then just

548
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
Turn his head to the left

549
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,112
Looking off camera

At this point everyone in the room to start a false silent and is looking around

552
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
I start

553
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,960
Like pinpointing it to like the the part of the room that has a security cameras

554
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,544
Monitor test test test test

555
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,920
I start listening to that and I got to get skyrover here again

556
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
Stop wait a minute

557
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320

00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Over

559
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
Their test test

560
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
And I looked in the direction

561
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Morgan's

562
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,512
Bet can I turn around

563
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
I pick up my phone

564
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
IPhone

565
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
And The Echoes coming out of my speaker

566
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,448
Is coming out of your phone coming out of my phone

567
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
Why is your phone

568
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Playing out

569
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,128
Google stop

570
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
It's playing up in this way

571
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
He zeroes in on this mic that's on the corner of the computer that's doing the Google Hangouts

572
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Pictures onto this hang on

573
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
He leans over to that

574
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
Start fiddling with it

575
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,752
Is there a way he stands he said

576
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Whois

577
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
It's coming for it's not coming from this way

578
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
It's coming from

579
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
The Google Hangout cuz I just muted it and software

580
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Now it's gone

581
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
So my voice Google Hangout let's hear Peter's voice

582
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Beer

583
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
I want to test

584
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Audio coming from you say some stuff

585
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,448
Allwood Manor okay

586
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
And then I think Suka says something like

587
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Google Hangout

588
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
Why is our chat coming through your phone

589
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Oh wait

590
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,320
So the audio coming out of her phone is not

591
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
Originating from in the room it's

592
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
It's somehow the Google

593
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Hangout chat

594
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
That's coming through phone yes

595
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,328
So weird very weird

596
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
It was like

597
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Your cat had just turned into a monster or dad started talking to you or like just turned on

598
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Can you

599
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
So

600
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
I'm kneeling on the bed with it

601
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
And I look at it

602
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,712
And I think that's when I just like

603
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Through it

604
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Threw It On The Bed

605
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
Revulsion so

606
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Can you turn on the screen

607
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,000
He picks up the phone from the end of her bed and hands it to her and is like can you pull up

608
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
The screen

609
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Well what all apps running on this phone

610
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
I don't run any app

611
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
Is that doing video

612
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm recording

613
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
At this point the cameras have like swiveled

614
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
So they're focused on the phone

615
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Okay

616
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Switzerland River

617
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
Can you use this Android

618
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,792
How do you manually get a list of apps running late by swiping down from the top or something

619
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
I think I don't know

620
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
I'm sorry I don't

621
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,592
How about that give me swipe down there's that sing this next to the thing

622
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
What about that thing

623
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
With

624
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Yes

625
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
But just give me a second

626
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,632
I don't see a Hangouts app running

627
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Idaho

628
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Well

629
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
I didn't

630
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
Test run a hangout

631
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
I think it's talk you listen to it

632
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Test test test

633
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Bestop hasn't

634
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,296
Suddenly the phone stop doing the weird thing it was doing audio player

635
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
It went it went away which field hackery the hackers have been had

636
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Just realized

637
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah that's what I think there was an attacker

638
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,168
And they screwed up and accidentally turned on the speaker

639
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Yeah it's weird is it

640
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
Creepy

641
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,176
What do you mean packed what kind of active in

642
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Define doubted

643
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Private

644
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
Messages someone's been had access to them

645
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Or is it people have been

646
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Sending

647
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
Messages spoof

648
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
To be from you

649
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
To your friends or colleagues

650
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Can a horrible

651
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
So eventually

652
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
They just decide to turn off her phone

653
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,640
Now it becomes a more civilized conversation of

654
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
What are we going to do

655
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,808
And then Google said to me

656
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,536
It's like I think I'd rather donate my body

657
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
No

658
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Well

659
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
What would it take for you to donate your phone to science

660
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,264
Like in the current state of it right now

661
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
Without without like

662
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
Yeah that's a problem no way

663
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
Like that has so much

664
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Is my work on it

665
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
And my

666
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
Okay life

667
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
I just think that

668
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,672
Oh I don't think I have to justify

669
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Why

670
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
That's right you don't have to justify it

671
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
But

672
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Do you have a Leah pictures

673
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,264
And some pictures but not much

674
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,080
I-chaya put myself in your position I would have been like

675
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,688
I feel okay I don't know I start

676
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
But you were very immediately like the opposite

677
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
That's a no to me why

678
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Tumi

679
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
My responsibility is not to

680
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
Just to myself you know privacy is a shared

681
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,560
Resource associated with a share it's something we share with each other

682
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,192
I will say this is one of the first stories where I

683
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Get

684
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,080
What privacy and data protection like means

685
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,736
Like I remember when Morgan was telling me the story thinking if someone had hacked into Morgan

686
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Phone

687
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,576
How long have you been hacked in for

688
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
I charge Morgan all the time

689
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
I was kind of hat

690
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
You know and then it's like

691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
We who else did you talk to her tell your dad was kind of crappy exchange those text messages that weren't on

692
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Signal that person was kind of hat

693
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,008
Randomly just dawned on me duh like

694
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Her privacy isn't just hers

695
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
The things that are on my phone that are private or not only private from either private for for anyone I was talking to an

696
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,344
Almost feel like I don't even have a right to give over that phone

697
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
If I haven't

698
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
Talk to the people that

699
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,792
Then that would be exposing like that's not fair like sometimes people insist on privacy can feel

700
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Selfish

701
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
Yeah then you realize like no like

702
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
One person doesn't insist on privacy

703
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
Kind of like a chink in the armor

704
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
And like something they were all vulnerable

705
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,760
For about an hour Morgan and Zuko go back and forth about what to do with her phone

706
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,856
But they don't really reach a conclusion

707
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
Need to walk around

708
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Is anything going to happen if I go take a little walk

709
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah you're not going to miss much

710
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Planner schedule

711
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
I'm so sorry for no good reason I can't think of any reason for you not to take a walk

712
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Risk of freaked out

713
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Okay

714
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Yeah

715
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Okay

716
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
What

717
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
I said be safe out there

718
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Enjoy

719
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
Do you think I meant

720
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Do you think I'm a

721
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Secret agent

722
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
I wasn't thinking that

723
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
I was thinking

724
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Was afraid for you

725
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
I'm not afraid

726
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Yeah I'm not either I was just feeling that way

727
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
I'm going to take a walk so I feel really close

728
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
So then

729
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
I had to decide

730
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
What should we do

731
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Shall we

732
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
Abort ceremony

733
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
Shall we

734
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,351
Focus our attention on some sort of Investigation of Morgan's phone

735
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
What should we do

736
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
Here's a decision here's what we're going to do

737
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
You get more out of here and otherwise

738
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
No change

739
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,063
He figured this these people have hacked into Morgan's phone we have

740
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,623
So many security measures in place that

741
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
We can keep going

742
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Don't breathe us out later

743
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
So basically what happens is like

744
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
Morgan comes back from our walk

745
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Brewery

746
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,519
I still have another full day of the ceremony last

747
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Okay

748
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
And then

749
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
It gets to a point where

750
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,503
They finally have the final key

751
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Everybody

752
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
The big step

753
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Is there a high five

754
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
Unplugged

755
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,719
No we're done

756
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
And then

757
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,031
To sort of top it off I mean if you want to use the angle grinder

758
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,103
Everybody takes their compute node

759
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
And destroy that

760
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Because

761
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
In the case of the computer holds like

762
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,855
Ghostie fingerprint of that like original piece of the key

763
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
I just wanted

764
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,695
Dawn saw the computer into pieces

765
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,535
I missed smash the pieces with a hammer

766
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
And dropped

767
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,631
The crushed pieces into a giant bonfire

768
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
And that was that

769
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,735
And now they were sort of

770
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
The moment

771
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,087
Weather like okay well we actually did the technological

772
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,671
Thing which was we created the system

773
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,999
And now the bigger question was did they

774
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Create the Alchemy

775
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:25,471
Did they needed to inspire trust like we're all the protocols in the video footage and all that stuff

776
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
Was it all enough

777
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,615
Especially now that they have this phone thing happened the phone thing

778
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,503
Why did we do what we needed to do to show the world that they want to buy into this thing

779
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,671
So five days after the ceremony ended the currency begin

780
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
To an insane

781
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Fanfare

782
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Really it was

783
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:55,167
Crazy because she's a cryptocurrency built on bitcoin

784
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:01,567
It is dedicated to protecting your privacy but I think it went up like $4,000

785
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:06,687
21 zcash coin and that is

786
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
The Bitcoin High

787
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
At the time is like

788
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,671
Around 1400 so that's insane

789
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
Inspire

790
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
A community

791
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,071
To then use it it seems like it has it has done that

792
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,447
People continue to point back at this phone moment and wonderin speculate

793
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Some

794
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
Yeah people of people want me to they want to know like

795
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Power results

796
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,919
And how does it resolve them and did you give him your phone

797
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,039
So what actually happened was we went to this bonfire

798
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
And then by the end of it

799
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,695
Did everybody was sort of rushing off I was rushing to the to the airport and

800
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
Just like game iPhone does he go

801
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
I was like

802
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
We'll talk about it

803
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
I trust you

804
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Don't do anything

805
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
But I haven't agreed to

806
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,823
So you ended in the in the in the in the spirit of the whole Endeavor in some way

We have to do it again

810
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
