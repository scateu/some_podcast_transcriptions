1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and today a story that we

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,184
Been working on for close to two years but just before we're about to put on the air

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
This happened our next story in perspective it's as if someone

6
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
One had killed Lassie as you probably know over this past summer a Minnesota dentist named Walter

7
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,824
Sir Palmer paid 55 grand to get permission

8
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
Hunt and kill a lion a lion named Cecil

9
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
The country of Zimbabwe who's the pretty famous lines or the star of that Park and been in a few studies so immediately there were alligators

10
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
The poaching Zimbabwe where Cecil was killed open up an investigation but what really caught our eye

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Was the reaction from the public lion killer the words painted on the home of dr. Walter Palmer

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
People found out his home address started sharing online his livelihood now

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Protesters gathered outside his office

14
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
He was forced to temporarily close his business across the internet all over social media and YouTube

15
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
To bend warning this next minute contains some

16
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Pretty strong language

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
You are truly scum-of-the-earth wrote One

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
May you f****** fun to death I want somebody to take f****** with beds

19
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
Today we bring you a story that we hope

20
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
Will be a little bit of signal and all that noise this is a story about that

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488
Strange relationship between wanting to hunt and kill an animal

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
And wanting to save it

23
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
And it comes from my producers Simon Adler

24
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
1 2 3 4 5

25
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
1 2 3 4 5

26
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,752
Alright so this story really started for me

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
In Salt Lake City

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
The past February I went to the Western hunting & conservation Expo sometimes

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
Referred to as the Super Bowl of hunting from walking through

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
This airplane Hangar size room is massive Convention Center called the salt

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Alice over 40000 people there gun manufacturers ever bowmakers there were

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
Call makers from the single Reed

33
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Camouflage

34
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
Clothing apparel companies

35
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
And I hope you're having a good time and if you're having a good time

36
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
I want to hear a Big E Hall

37
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
As part of the Expo off this main floor

38
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
There was a banquet hall where there was an MC who is working

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
What's today

40
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
I want to continue on a couple of thoughts

41
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
That we touched on last night

42
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Your greatest

43
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Conservation

44
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
President Theodore Roosevelt said

45
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
The wild life

46
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
And its habitat

47
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Cannot speak for itself

48
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
So we

49
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Must

50
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Let me tell you

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
We have

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
And we will continue to speak

53
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
But we've got to go further than

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Speaking

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
We're going to have to suit up in our armor to go into battle

56
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
To protect our wildlife

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
On our way of life

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Let me tell you we are at War brought on by the extreme radical environmental movement

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
If we're not vigilant

60
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Dangerous enemy

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,120
The most endangered species in America

62
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Could be

63
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
The American Hunter

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
Now one of the things that surprised me

65
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
Kind of right off the bat was

66
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Talking to people everybody kept

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,432
Coming back to the side and hitting on this idea that like if it weren't for us if it weren't for the hunters

68
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
The animals would not be alive without us unto him

69
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
They would go extinct I got that line over and over

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,928
If there would be no animals other hunt basically what they mean by this is

71
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
They are the ones that are

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,303
Paying to keep these animals around they are doing to our funding conservation

73
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
And I saw what that look like on the final night of the Expo Saturday night when the

74
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Organizers held this auction

75
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
And Now's the Time to open your wallets

76
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
Get out your checkbooks your credit cards

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
In fact we're leaving take IOU written on the back of a napkin

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,319
Let's make some money for wildlife buddy

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
First couple items that are just like guns rifles

80
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
Pearlstone a picture of the sheep pops up on this

81
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,911
Jumbo screen up on the stage as you can see right there right

82
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Big ones

83
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Huge curling horns

84
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
Thick brown coat beautiful color

85
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Beauty python The Bucket List brother

86
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,943
That's on the bucket list so the winner of this auction item what they're actually buying

87
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Is the chance to go up

88
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
To Canada in a very specific area

89
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
Enter shoot one of these sheets

90
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
To get a tag to shoot one of these

91
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
I have an opening bid of $30,000

92
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
32 and a half 32

93
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Community service

94
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
I'm 32 and a half down the middle need 35 one time ago to now we can find 35001 diamond last call

95
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
Sold them right over here $35,000 The Grind

96
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Number 6 picture of a moose comes on this

97
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,231
Broadview moose Hunters what a great shiras moose antlers

98
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Banout like giant wings

99
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
70 and 1/2 20 22 and 1/2

100
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
How does a conservation easement work

101
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
State has an agency that's responsible for managing its Wild

102
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
It's up your Hunter

103
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,559
Basically have to buy a tag from that state agency

104
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
In order to shoot just about any how

105
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,703
For example in Arizona Arizona is grid of hunting area

106
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
And you apply to a lottery

107
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
For Zone B I would really like to be able to shoot a moose you put your $20 in

108
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Christmas typical

109
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
And

110
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
60000

111
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
If your name comes up you get your tag for $20

112
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
Spell possible that you're not going to get one

113
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
And sometimes you have to wait 10 or 20 years especially for these big game at

114
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
So what is agency

115
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Please do

116
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
3000

117
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
They set aside a certain number of these tags

118
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Every year which are called conservation Tech

119
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
And what these conservation tags are is like

120
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,079
If you just give a bunch of money right now you have free range to do what you want

121
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
Stop the line

122
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Shoot the animal you want

123
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
No way

124
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Freaking better

125
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
And then all that money goes back to those State agencies for Land Management habitat restoration

126
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
Patient like we're talking millions of dollars raised this way one auction item that I saw I sold that night

127
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Special big game enhancement

128
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143

Which basically gave

130
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Whoever wanted the right to shoot

131
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Just about any animal in the entire state of New Mexico

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055

133
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,663
I'm a hundred 75 I'll go 81.

134
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991

Sold at $230,000

136
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
Wow

137
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,863
In fact the whole reason I'd come to this convention

138
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
What to talk to guys with done

139
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Intoxalock

140
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
But he's gay

141
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
The kind of blew up on

142
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Also did not expect to be in the position I am

143
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
My name is Corey Knowlton

144
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Cor

145
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Ey

146
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Cayenne

147
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Owl

148
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
T o

149
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
You know if I move around alot

150
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,999
Quinton has become kind of the poster child of this idea of Hunter conservation

151
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Vici the Texas millionaire

152
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
I met him in his hotel room right across the street from the X

153
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,215
White T-shirt blue jeans little bit of stubble on his face and

154
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
Story goes back in January 2014

155
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
He was an expo super similar to this one

156
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Put on by the Dallas

157
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
I have my wife with me

158
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
You just walking the floor when

159
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
He bumped into a friend of it

160
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Gentleman by the name of John Jackson

161
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Okay and John Jackson

162
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Heads up

163
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
A group called

164
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Conservation Force

165
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
So anyway John came to me

166
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
And he told Corey that he was working

167
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
That the Dallas Safari Club

168
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
They were auctioning off

169
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Opportunity to hunt

170
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
A black rhino

171
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
In

172
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Namibia

173
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Namibian Ministry of environment and tourism

174
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
I'd given them one tag

175
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Antoine black rice

176
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
And they were going to auction it

177
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Now the black rhino is a critically endangered

178
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Species

179
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
5000 of them in the world about 2000 mmba

180
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,879
And what the namibian government does is they auction off the older males

181
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
What happened to the black rhino gets older

182
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
It sees other rhinos

183
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
He wants to attack the

184
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Boston time

185
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
And kill them

186
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
So the government will offer up the

187
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Problem rhinos

188
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
For trophy

189
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
And then use the money

190
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
To protect the others

191
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
From poachers

192
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
Is poaching of the Black Rhinos a real issue

193
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
Huge issue Rhino horn right now

194
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
It goes with

195
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
$60,000

196
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Yeah it's weird like three times

197
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Per ounce

198
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,135
In any case Cory says the reason that John was so worried

199
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
John said Corey there's been a

200
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
A giant

201
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Push

202
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
People coming out against

203
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
It's literally a license to kill people don't want to talk

204
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,775
A permit to hunt down and kill one of the world's most endangered animals

205
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
You're not going to have

206
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Someone

207
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
To bid this minimum bid

208
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,271
His friend was worried that they're going to be these namibian ministers they are and they didn't want to be embarrassed

209
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
So John asked me if it would you at least bit the minimum bid just started like get the auction rolling as a friend

210
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Somebody I've been friends with for

211
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Over decade

212
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
I said

213
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Yes

214
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
Soap Natalie auction they started this auction

215
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Just like any other rocks

216
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Eventually

217
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
$50,000 thinking that way

218
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
Told the other bidders that's right I was like you know what I'm going to do what I told you

219
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Fall through my commitment

220
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
When all of a sudden going once going twice through Manhattan

221
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
You know I'm just me I'm just going home I'm just a guy take people on

222
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
But

223
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Immediately

224
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
I've got people

225
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Surrounding

226
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
You know giant line of people

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Congratulating me

228
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
She's like

229
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
I didn't expect to be the guy who did it

230
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
But okay

231
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
But

232
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Next 48 hours

233
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,079
We now know who paid $350,000 for a hunting permit

234
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
Killing endangered black rhino in Namibia a barrage of threats started coming

235
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
Among the thousands of postings I hope the Rhino rips you and 1/2 do your children know what a monster their father

236
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
I hope you get what you deserve

237
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Or short

238
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
And painful existence

239
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Corey says people threatened to murder his parents

240
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
The rape his wife to death from coming to your house

241
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Burn It Down

242
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
I'm going to put your kids in a wood chipper

243
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
I'm going to do it in front of you

244
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
At any point in this have you been super enthralled by the idea

245
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Have you always wanted to shoot a black

246
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Yeah I got to know we're going to

247
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Be quiet

248
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
I definitely haven't always wanted to show

249
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,903
YouTube black rhino have I always wanted to hunt for lost my remember

250
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Yes

251
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Okay

252
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Ladder big journey in life

253
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
When I was born we had

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Literally nothing

255
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
He told me he grew up in rural Missouri in a small house

256
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Trailer home

257
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
His mom raised a family his dad loaded trucks

258
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Safeway

259
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Okay we're trying to survive as a family

260
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
So when Corey with eight

261
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
We left Missouri

262
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,271
Witham in a Monte Carlo with $2,500 in the bank in a dream to make it

263
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Is world okay

264
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
So by the time I was 15

265
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
We moved all over the United States

266
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
His dad picked up jobs in Arizona

267
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Texas I'm going from school to school to school

268
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,631
I didn't really have a benefit of get any sports teams or whatever but the one thing I did is I had a dad that worked

269
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
His butt off

270
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Everyday

271
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
I didn't get to spend much time with him

272
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
So then we would get want to go do things like that lets go dove hunting that's Duffy's

273
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
You know he loved that

274
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
She mentioned this one time

275
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
News 11 we go out I have shotgun in my hand

276
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
Two doves fly up

277
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,623
And I shoot nothing both of them. One shot fell right there okay

278
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I went over there

279
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Got the dubs

280
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
That went through cleaning them

281
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Okay and preparing the cookie

282
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
And just being in that moment

283
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
And not worrying about

284
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,751
You know other problems that you met that we all go through in life and just having a nice quiet on my dad

285
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
I looked at is

286
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Privilege to go hanoi

287
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
I didn't look at it like hey it's my right to go out

288
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
And take some animals

289
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Looks like I'll look at it like

290
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
This is an awesome opportunity I get to go spend with my dad outside

291
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Now

292
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,487
As I became older I became more interested in hunting or learn about both I want to learn about hunting I was eight

293
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Get up with it by the time he's in his mid-20s he says

294
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
And this is right around the time his dad hit it big in the oil industry

295
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,007
He was leading Huntsman all around the world from the North Pole to as far south as you could hunt

296
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
In New Zealand Nepal Papua New Guinea so I've seen the whole world and he says somewhere in the

297
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
The middle of all of those trips

298
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
He realize

299
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
There's a big fight out there

300
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
This large biomass of humanity

301
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
Is taking over the world and

302
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
Wildlife doesn't exist by accident anymore

303
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
And so he started thinking about not just hunting these

304
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
But preserving them

305
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
And keeping them here all the witches to say when

306
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
He won that auction

307
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Without meaning

308
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
And started getting all this death threat

309
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
He didn't turn back

310
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
What on Earth is keeping you

311
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
So steadfast in going ahead and doing this

312
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
I think I would have

313
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Thought

314
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
I should

315
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
I was willing to do this

316
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
And it may have not been what I planned on

317
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
But I was willing to do this based on a commitment I made you a friend

318
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Make meth

319
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Family

320
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Make commitment

321
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
The conservation of the whole

322
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Look

323
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
This was never about

324
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Me going over

325
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
And taking

326
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Black rhinos live

327
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,519
Like Viola I get to achieve the Zenith of life and killing his black rhino give me a break

328
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
It was about

329
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Method

330
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
A conservation

331
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
To keep Black Rhinos on the face

332
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
You are saying

333
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
That you're doing this for conservation your detractors will say

334
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
They will say you say you were only doing it for conservation when you are really doing it for

335
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
I'm not saying that's what you said I'm saying that this is what they will throw at you

336
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
You were only you were saying you're only doing it for constipation

337
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
Well are you actually getting out of it as some sort of satisfaction

338
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
Can you talk for a minute about in car for more than a minute about it

339
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Okay alright

340
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Sure

341
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871
I enjoy the act of hunting can I tell you why

342
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,247
Could I wrap that up in a real pretty burrito for you to be able to eat and understand it taste good

343
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
No but I can tell you that

344
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
ICare

345
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
About

346
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
The survival of these

347
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
Species and do you understand why

348
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
People have a hard time

349
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Wrapping your mind around that

350
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
You believing that

351
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
And simultaneously wanting

352
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
To kill an animal

353
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,471
What it does that just does not compute you at all what point were

354
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
We're getting redundant they're missing

355
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
The whole boat we don't have one without the other

356
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Okay

357
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
If we want Wildlife to be

358
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Around

359
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Future generation

360
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
We have to understand

361
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
But that Wildlife has

362
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Value

363
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
If it doesn't have a bag you

364
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Especially in the continent of Africa

365
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
It's going to be gone

366
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
I'm sure he made a sort of economic

367
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
He said you got to keep in mind that

368
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Living next to a black rhino

369
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,007
Not just talking about it but actually living next to a black rhino

370
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
It's a nightmare

371
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,895
I mean who wants to live next door to a raging Psychopathic babysits

372
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Killing thing

373
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
No one

374
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,039
Sew-in just very purely economic terms it has a negative value

375
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,183
But what Cory will tell you and what conservation organizations like World Wildlife Fund and various others will tell you

376
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,279
Is by him paying $350,000 to shoot one

377
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
He is creating a positive

378
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
Value for that animal he's creating jobs for game wardens

379
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Is creating jobs for trackers

380
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
She got look at the net benefit

381
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
It's there when so what

382
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
What is the common ground here because you guys want the same things

383
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
And yet there's somehow this

384
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
We don't want the same

385
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
Conservationist in general do

386
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Common Ground has to be

387
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Do you or do you not want to see

388
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Black Rhinos on the face of the Earth

389
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
And I think

390
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Everyone agrees that they do

391
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
But I think he'd

392
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,863
No I think they do I are actions are speaking louder than their words

393
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,215
They're all at I think to a lot of people there these neo-colonial

394
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Sentiments

395
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
The you are this guy who has a lot of money

396
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
And you are paying a lot of money to go to Africa

397
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
To shoot this

398
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
And I think that

399
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
That causes a reaction

400
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Certain people

401
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
Do you think the amount of money plays into it or no

402
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Okay

403
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Okay

404
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,303
You say you don't answer anything or that I want

405
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,655
To give you the best office plants be understanding I'm really trying

406
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
To an emotional level Runway

407
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
My god dammit

408
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
And I know that the words

409
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Put out means

410
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
And

411
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
I don't want

412
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
People that

413
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Bent

414
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
I'm not a radical sign

415
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
If you conceived

416
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,335
Get you something I believe in I can believe in these animal

417
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
I believe that I want them

418
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
But I also understand

419
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
But the death of the species.

420
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
And so

421
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Putting myself through this because I believe

422
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
Embarrassed right cuz I've seen that it

423
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
And I'll go down and I will sit next

424
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
The people in Africa

425
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Both indigenous and 9

426
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,287
That have the exact same belief

427
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,895
And they want these animals they love them they want their kids here

428
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Dayton OH

429
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
That

430
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
One night

431
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
DeYoung

432
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Stars are above

433
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
And

434
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
They're sitting there

435
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
With their family

436
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
And lion roars in a distance

437
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
They feel that

438
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
They feel what it means to be afraid of it

439
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
If it would means

440
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Expected

441
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Play Feel Good Music

442
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Love it

443
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
And I want that

444
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Dudeiwantthat

445
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Realistic

446
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
View a realist

447
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
I believe I have a girl

448
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
What it takes

449
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Continue

450
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
So that conversation happened over 6 months ago

451
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
At that point

452
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
The Dodge was totally in limbo

453
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
You still receiving death threats

454
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
Animal Welfare organizations like Humane Society of the United States were lobbying and petitioning to try to

455
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Stop the hunt

456
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
And what it all really hinge Don was

457
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
A decision to be made by us Fish and Wildlife

458
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
Under The Endangered Species Act it's illegal to import the carcass

459
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
Of an endangered species into the United States

460
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
Unless you can prove

461
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,911
That by killing and importing that animal

462
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,519
You are helping the species as a whole so that's what US fish and wildlife had to decide

463
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
Would Corey killing and importing

464
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
That one black rhino help Black Rhinos as a whole

465
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
March went by

466
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
April

467
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
And then

468
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
In early May

469
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
I got a text from Cory. Just read

470
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Let's talk tomorrow

471
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
We take a trip

472
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
My name is Courtney and I'm cold

473
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,704
Pulling from Johannesburg South Africa Radiolab is supported by the Alfred P Sloan

474
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,104
Sloan foundation in hunting public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

475
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,968
Www.org

476
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,064
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

477
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,184
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting the show

478
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
And I request

479
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

480
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

481
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
So did something

482
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

483
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,272
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

484
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

485
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

486
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

487
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
If you have a story please share it with us

488
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,360
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

489
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
Record short audio message for us

490
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,528
And that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much

491
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Leisure by

492
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Alright we are off the plane

493
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
Walking out into the airport I suppose this would be the first time we've actually stepped foot in the movie yet

494
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Beyond the destination I'm Jenna reporter Simon Adler

495
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,792
So they never getting that text message I land in Namibia meet back up with court today where and when

496
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,608
Maybe it's the 13th of May 2015

497
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
This is Simon's Big Data interview local officials professional hunters in any bum

498
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
We've been traveling for

499
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,200
Probably like closer than 48 hours now year if you're feeling all right at this point through a lot better now

500
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
Just getting off the plane and feeling the wind we get through

501
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
Customs and everything and immediately xiamen

502
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,744
Simon I meant a nice to meet you manga met by the pH

503
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
Can't even hear the pH I am a professional Hunter

504
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
The professional Hunter

505
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
The Christopher Cody Knowlton

506
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
Do I system on Nissan

507
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
He's sort of the manager of this entire Pro

508
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Big dude

509
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Scraggly beard short shorts

510
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
We need to come pick up her stuff

511
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
He leads us out of the airport

512
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
So what does the day's agenda hold for us

513
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Yorkie has just started my friend

514
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
So getting the truck start driving and do you mind if I ask you some questions while we drive you

515
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
I immediately just realized what a headache putting all this together has been for him

516
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
10 million phone calls meetings of the meetings with the ministry of environment and

517
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,968
What is amid office checking with local offices to help them figure out which is the best rhino

518
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,368
4 quart to shoot how many at this point you know exactly which one you'll be going out

519
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,768
After there a couple the Main Place we've identified that is to rhinos we can remove from that area

520
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
Both male Progressive post-reproductive we going to try to get on one of these two animals and try to remove

521
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
But as professional as we can possibly do

522
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
So we're at the ministry of environment and tourism

523
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
Is apparently a meet-and-greet

524
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,432
Later that day we stopped to shake hands with

525
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
The permanent secretary Simeon negombo

526
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
You get this kind of prepared speech

527
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
About how trophy hunting is a big part of why Namibia is considered the gold standard of

528
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Conservation in Africa

529
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Disk program

530
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Assisted

531
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
To have a wildlife

532
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Troy

533
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,264
Wildlife World Zoo Mosaic climbing

534
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Like it

535
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
Elephant with less than 1000

536
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
But now we have

537
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
Cadence we don't know where to put them in

538
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
Sedalia mini now

539
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,928
Deal with a surplus

540
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Fast forward to the next morning 4:46 a.m.

541
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
I doubt that Simon

542
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,096
Nor I got any sleep last night

543
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Vital that

544
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
Someone's gonna get hurt

545
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
He was in high school

546
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
I woke up this morning it was drizzling rain

547
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,944
Around curb, passenger train

548
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
The truck is firearm and ammunition big knives and things

549
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,768
So we can scan another Rhino was on the phone I taken care of final details

550
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
And much to my chagrin there is

551
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
This crew of CNN reporters hanging around

552
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
Once everything was loaded

553
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Beijing Capital airport

554
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
She'll leave you here Corey

555
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
And I waved them off okay

556
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,408
Happy Hunting

557
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
I wasn't able to go on the Rhino hunt

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
What I know I know you're using disappointment number one Hunting Party can only be so

559
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Large in the media

560
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,072
And with these three CNN guys there

561
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Did the party was just

562
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,216
But you also have to understand I was in the country

563
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Illegal

564
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,312
I had no press pass I had known

565
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,176
Press video to this is like I've got to keep my head down

566
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,528
What time are you telling me the story is over that we racing

567
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
Corey's personal cameraman he promised to give me all of his audio so we do have the audio and we will get to that but will they were headed up

568
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,768
North that actually ended up going east and

569
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
Where I went totally unexpectedly made this model of conservation and how it works like

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
Finally clicked into place for me I do you mind just telling me your name and where we are at home when I was almost wonderful

571
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
My name is is Deltona pool

572
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
So the owner of these continents

573
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
It sounds good Andre and Estelle Swanepoel own the aru game

574
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Which are a series of

575
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Huge wasp

576
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Of land that they

577
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Fenced-in

578
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,512
I'm totally have like over 200 square miles of land

579
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,352
Actually used to be filled with cat on no 15 16 years ago

580
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,448
We converted into a game form basically they decided

581
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
How to get rid of all the cattle and bringing all these animals they've got your rafts they've got two different species of zebras will.

582
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:09,248
The Beast Ultra beasts in all they got 29 different species including how many black rhinos are on the property here

583
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Up until about three weeks ago. Then and now we we've got eleven one of the hunting guides staff

584
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:22,048
At the auto game mode is in the movie told me that they actually just had a rhino born on the

585
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
Property and in fact I've had several throughout the years born on this property and we have to find one

586
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Look for signs and keep our eyes feeling so what should I be looking for if I'm going to be of any help here

587
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:41,248
Yeah I'm at this until just look like a big gray rock that you really going to have a Keen Eye driving through the

588
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
Really tall thick grass that kind of enveloped the car was almost like we're driving through a cloud

589
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,280
This is the calorie Sawgrass and set realistic Summers like the monster on top of it

590
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
And after

591
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Searching and searching and searching I was just

592
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
Like a hundred yards away oh man okay

593
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
They had the vehicle so you know it's still a very safe distance

594
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
Can you can put the binoculars man looking

595
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,680
Skip the binoculars and he's just pointed straight at as his head moving left to right left to right I think this is

596
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
Does a bull by the looks of things it looks like a dinosaur

597
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
Very prehistoric looking animal

598
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,088
Keep trotting away from us started moving away from us

599
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,976
Tiny looking legs so when they run they have to kind of shuffle along I think of the girls was in the

600
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
Laughlin Nevada movies

601
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
They're lucky to the front one she's at the we were tailing behind it in the crazy thing is

602
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:14,176
Huge animal that weighs over a ton on it is on the Move thinking move like 30 miles per hour

603
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
We're currently driving in about 15 km an hour and he's getting away from us and left us behind

604
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
So you want nothing to do about these moving off of at one point before it took off we actually got close enough

605
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:33,632
That with the binoculars on Steph was able to get a good look at its ear

606
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
And this one doesn't actually have an earmark in it so perhaps this one was born on this

607
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Property

608
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
What the hell does that work how did

609
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
How did the Rhinos get to be on this property

610
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,808
The ministry of environment tourism has been in touch with the owner of Otto Graham Rogers

611
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,696
Government said hey you got all this land will you take a couple of these rhinos and protect them for us

612
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,024
And you know we started off of a couple

613
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
3 Donovan the number 3

614
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
Strange foster care types

615
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:13,056
Each year we have to take photos of them and we build up a portfolio and then we can send it into the Met it's interesting that lie

616
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
They are breeding here

617
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
So there are more of them now than there would have been

618
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,784
If they hadn't been moved here yeah yes he's like

619
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Another thing

620
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,136
We will knuckle assembly actually we lost it runners

621
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,792
Steph said he want to show me something about 10 minutes then he stopped the car at the small clear

622
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:39,936
Almost no grass one Lone Tree I feel when I

623
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
Stumble across the street and can you describe what we're looking at right

624
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:52,736
I hear bones scattered all over the right side of the kalari bleach white bones again

625
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
Read Brett's and see if they can see some positive spine as well as that a rhino skull

626
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,464
It's just unreal

627
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
You see that there

628
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
We got out of the car and like actually like held these bones of God

629
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Wow

630
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
How how did that happen

631
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,336
It was a dominant do I was fighting with a younger boo

632
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,920
The two squared off and the older one ended up

633
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
Goring the younger one with its horn

634
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
Really sweet

635
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Pushing the envelope passed away

636
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
He killed it

637
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,672
Then this this older bowl that it just

638
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Killed the younger one

639
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Steph told me then went up to this female

640
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Wanted to bring the juice and the

641
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,888
Young female wasn't ready she wasn't mature enough yet

642
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
She kept forcing himself on her

643
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Over and over until

644
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
So she couldn't enjoy longer

645
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,456
That I guess it would happen in nature as well it's just unfortunate that today

646
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Add to beer

647
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
See how they would have been even more butt

648
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Nature take its course we can get involved in

649
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
How it is

650
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,000
Steve explain to me that it was these type of black rhino

651
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
Older aggressive bulls that get

652
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,632
Auctioned up for guys like Cory to come over and shoot

653
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
And then all the money that's been paid for it

654
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Is going back

655
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Logang back into

656
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,336
Anti-poaching unit is going back into

657
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Conserving

658
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Rhino send

659
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
It's nice to see such a large sum of money coming in

660
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
For a good cause

661
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
So he believes in this program

662
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,880
Never be able to

663
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Deschutes

664
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
Black rhino

665
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,536
Dwight what what about you personally wouldn't

666
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Cheetah rhino

667
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
For me

668
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
Explain why

669
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Not the notes

670
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Difficult to say

671
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Enough

672
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Doesn't tickle me

673
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
Over the next couple days at the lodge

674
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
As I was hanging out with kind of these

675
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Tourists

676
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,464
From all over the world would come here to be wined and dined and then

677
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,536
Gotten shoot stuff in the morning and afternoon

678
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Steps ambivalence

679
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
30 to make a deep sort of sense

680
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Tiffany toma toma toma toma

681
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,728
For instance I spent a lot of time with this guy

682
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
Steven Lindstrom middle-aged there with the family on vacation we decided six years ago that we will

683
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Google

684
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
To Africa

685
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
So I'm very happy to

686
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Be here today

687
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,016
This is six years in the making for you

688
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,856
Yeah you can say Volvo's corporate office and

689
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Need a big truck

690
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,976
Maybe some picture from my home do you have lots on the wall already

691
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Show me

692
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
And now today I can't we have at least

693
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
50 more

694
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
I got the following a few hun

695
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,472
Him and his got my name is SpongeBob over

696
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Stamina setting

697
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,920
One of the times we spent about 2 and 1/2 hours

698
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
Searching for different animals talking different animals

699
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
And then in the distance

700
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:10,368
So very nice what about bull we finally found a water bug

701
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,952
Which is what it's kind of like a reindeer

702
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
But

703
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,792
It has he's too big Longhorns

704
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
Shoot backwards almost like

705
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Spirit

706
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Big animal

707
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Like a Stone

708
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,496
Norse mythology is just going to close NC

709
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
We hop down from the car and just kind of

710
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
Slowly moving towards it through the grass

711
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:36,992
Type of animal is the top for me this weekend and his laundry seven told me he had a list of animals

712
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
He was hoping to shoot and this was at the top of this one with the game

713
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
Charges $2,800 to shoot

714
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Walking through

715
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Chandelier

716
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Every like 10 minutes weave

717
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Stop to measure how far away it was 12 to 6

718
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Eventually

719
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
We got this a couple hundred feet away from it

720
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,056
The animals off in the distance is just kind of pacing

721
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Simple.

722
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Tripod sets it up

723
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
And Stephen gets into position

724
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
The buck stumbled a few paces and you don't

725
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Fall down

726
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
But then again

727
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
Right back up and stumbles forward

728
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
What's this one

729
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,176
Appreciative

730
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Add appointment seems tense

731
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,344
Cuz like he knows that the animal is suffering

732
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,280
The dog takes off runs after it and just keeps it at babe I kind of circling it and we start moving towards it

733
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Again second shot doesn't kill it

734
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,736
Fall down get back up fall down again

735
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Next Injustice

736
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Benton housing

737
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Pretty upset

738
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
I don't know what you said it the first time better

739
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Irvin High

740
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
And the third shot

741
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Duncan killer

742
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
Discipline

743
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Macadamia nut

744
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
I will try

745
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Finally fourth shot

746
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Because

747
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
What's the winning shot

748
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
I can still kicking a little bit but it is

749
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Done

750
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Oh it's so nice

751
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
I'm so happy I'm so happy

752
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
What's the top of the list for me this weekend

753
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Movie synopsis perfect

754
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Is very nice feelings

755
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Seeing it up close

756
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
It can be

757
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Emotionally difficult

758
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,776
But when you pan out it's pretty clear the numbers show that this namibian model is working

759
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:18,176
Wildlife numbers on private land have gone up by almost 80% since the government allowed people to

760
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
Buy sell and shoot Wildlife on their land and since trophy hunting of the black rhino with legalized

761
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,184
That population has grown by like 30%

762
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,584
Button front of my face not all African conservationists are on board I talked to a guy named

763
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,192
Richard Leakey Super Famous Anthropologist who also directed

764
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Kenya's Wildlife program for a while

765
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,848
And I asked what is your stance on this idea of sustainable use

766
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,200
Listen to me I think it's absolutely ridiculous

767
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,832
If a father cant afford to pay school fees for his children

768
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:02,208
Does you say to somebody you can rape my daughter so I can get the money to pay for school fees

769
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,048
I don't think we go to set some standards in life and I think was his mom sue for

770
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
What this argument is about killing wild animals

771
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
So that they can be looked after

772
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,496
Absolutely sends the wrong message

773
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
This was the big issue he took

774
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
With Namibia strategy

775
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,920
Yes you can you can afford to lose five Runners from a breeding perspective

776
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,224
Does that send the right message

777
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,600
She then told me a story about when he took over Kenya's Wildlife service in 1989

778
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
At the time

779
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
Things were dire elephants were being killed in her Lobby number and we were going to lose our elephants totally poaching with

780
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,912
Is on the rise and his predecessors had actually confiscated a huge number of elephant tusk

781
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
From this boat

782
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Tough.

783
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,568
You said you thought that's another Library

784
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,128
Zelda side remake about 3 million dollars

785
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,455
And then use that money to help fight poaching

786
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
But like you said know what he did instead when she built a giant Tower of that ivory

787
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,511
Taken by poachers burn

788
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
Puns of contraband

789
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
Three days. Television newspapers magazines radio

790
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
CPR stat to draw

791
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
The world's attention to the

792
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
Site of elephants and part of what he was saying in that was like we have to Value these things beyond their dollar value

793
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
If the respect the intrinsic value of the

794
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
These creatures the wait a second

795
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,695
If you're burning a bunch of ivory aren't you in effect

796
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
Increasing the value of the ivory cuz now there's just less of it out there so you're looking at the supply end of it right yes by

797
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,191
Reducing Supply that would push up price leaky was attacking the demand side

798
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,239
What an impact it had to run the world

799
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:56,383
Opinion changed overnight. He said it woke the public up people stop buying Ivory and the market

800
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
For ivory

801
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Is it crashed

802
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,319
Up to that time would be losing about three and a half thousand elephants to four thousand elephants a year

803
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
A year later we were losing

804
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
At most

805
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
60

806
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Really

807
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
Enormous impact boyfriend

808
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Getting a public

809
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
Support conservation of Wildlife

810
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,959
That's a huge Challenge and we just can't afford icing

811
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Just send out the wrong messages

812
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
But the problem with that is

813
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,455
Finding the right message is getting harder and harder

814
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,783
I called various conservation organizations

815
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
And one guy who I talked to told me that

816
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,183
Their average age of donor is getting older

817
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
More and more people just living in cities less people are having positive experiences in the natural way

818
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,727
World at a young age and so he said that they're going to have to continue focusing on people focusing on us

819
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
This message of

820
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
What does Wildlife give us

821
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
What does it do for p

822
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Third Day up in the area

823
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Still no luck we're just going to

824
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Keep at it

825
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,159
Back in the media after 3 days of bushwhacking through this

826
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
Dance

827
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
Vegetation

828
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Up in the north of the country

829
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
Corey and his crew finally got on the tracks of the right Ryan

830
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
The local guy says wakanda rhino

831
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,447
Better Built another Rhino that it killed another rhino

832
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
So we're going to follow this

833
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
Like 100% sure that it's the right one

834
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
And then we'll try to take if we can

835
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,687
So for the next couple hours they they track the animal looking for

836
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Fiscally footprints

837
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
Anywhere that is marked its territory

838
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
Play Store

839
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,719
We were at walk at this point just about 12 MI

840
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
It was very hot

841
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:54,655
The grass was so thick that they really couldn't see more than about 30 feet in front of

842
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,239
And eventually they find you can see this is a rhino

843
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
A pile of rhino fees

844
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,359
Is that still warm still very moist mean it's practices

845
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:09,759
We're not more than an hour behind that animal right there you can see the dung beetles and everything in it and so

846
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:15,135
Set there for a few minutes right gathered our thoughts

847
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
You wanted out where and what you say

848
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
And then

849
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,095
About two hours later from my left

850
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
All I see is running Beast with a giant saber on its head

851
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
It was like lightning

852
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,991
So you also didn't get it with the first shot the first

853
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
Several shots did not kill the

854
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
It ran off and then they have to start tracking

855
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
Bonded oil

856
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
We followed it

857
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
I would say 10 minutes out of

858
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:55,839
La looked over there I saw it wasn't lying down at this point it was standing up but it has already fallen down twice

859
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
It was dying

860
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
And then

861
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
I shot it

862
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
The last thing you do

863
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,687
Is what you really assured its dad you touch its eye

864
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
If it doesn't blink

865
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,527
So did you go take your time

866
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Absolutely

867
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
Animal like that is there some sort

868
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:24,511
Is there a conversation going on now that the animal is is dead and you're not know

869
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,839
We just kind of looked at everybody looked at each other make sure we are okay

870
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
There wasn't a whole lot of talk I didn't this guy

871
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
But it was an emotional moment for me

872
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
So

873
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Debate

874
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,615
We've been sitting here skin this animal so far this morning

875
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
And now we're about to roll it over skin the other side and then just take the quarters off just like any other animal that you would if your

876
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Hunting trip

877
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,975
They loaded up all the meat to be shipped off to a local Village

878
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
And

879
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
They

880
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
Kept a little bit of it for themselves

881
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,423
So kicking my first piece of black rhino me here on the coals next to the karges

882
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Right here's the moment when

883
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,847
Everybody here has started eating some of those black rhino so it just

884
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Apart of

885
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
The part of hunting and a part of being a human

886
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,503
So it's a pretty

887
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,903
Unique an awesome moment right here I'm not really morally outraged by I'm maybe I'm a little but

888
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
I think you might be vulnerable if you insist that your enthusiasm for hunting is part of the balance Renee

889
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
But I think Robert perfectly

890
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:37,471
You don't have those k93 and salad and I understand that people don't like it

891
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,287
Any more than they wouldn't like going and killing the lamb

892
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
Of the lamb chops I eat

893
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
What are dynamic mean it's wrong

894
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Hunting

895
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,223
It's part of who we are now it may be a bigger part of

896
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
Who I am then you are

897
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
And that's fine

898
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
But when

899
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Wildlife populations

900
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
Abound is when they're managed by Humans Beings the alternate model might be a view of humans that's

901
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
Different from yours I think

902
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
You assume

903
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
That

904
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,495
Because we are smart and because there are so many of us

905
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
That inevitably

906
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
We will bump into them

907
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
And when we do we will win

908
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
And that's your calculator

909
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
The alternate model might be

910
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,039
That because we are smart

911
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
We might create a space

912
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Willy won't bump

913
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
Now you're now you're not in the real world

914
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
We're dealing not in reality

915
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,559
Okay I'm glad I'm living in a world that matters and it's real

916
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,959
So it's not it's not a dream scenario and it's not saying okay well let's just create this unfortunately these Ana

917
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
Animals don't have that time

918
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:47,359
So I'm not trying to outsmart anybody it's just a traditional method that's worked

919
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
And until

920
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
Somebody comes up

921
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,271
With a methodology that we can look at and say this is

922
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
In better way

923
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
I'm going to continue

924
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,647
Defy in believe in the traditional model

925
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,487
So now we're going to ask ourselves these

926
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,583
How do we really on an individual basis

927
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
Value

928
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
This animal

929
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Survival

930
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
On Earth

931
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Do you really value it

932
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,359
Do you value it past making 75 characters into your iPhone tweeting about it

933
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,175
Devalue it past watching Animal Planet

934
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Tumi

935
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
I know

936
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
And I care

937
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
And I placed an egg

938
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Stream

949
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
