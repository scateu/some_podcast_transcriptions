Hello

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Hi there

17
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Hi. Doug this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
Professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,000
You may know him as the guy who wrote Godel Escher Bach

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
Which is a hugely influential book

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Is there in circles

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
Pink star producer Lynn Levy

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,544
Because of an obsession of his which predates the

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
16 I was 16 the Year 1961 I was taking a French literature

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Glass in one day

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
I came across this poem

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
A tiny little bow

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
It kind of sat right in the middle of the page

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Like a long

32
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,488
Thin sausage vertical three

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Syllables

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
Caroline it was super skinny and 28 lines long and long and it was delightful it was very

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Very cute and funny I fell in love with the poem immediately and memorize did I Still Know It by hard to Palm is basic

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
Play Get Well cards written by the sky climb on Monroe who was a poet in the early fifteen hundreds

Queen

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,808
This Queen's daughter

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Seven or eight in

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
She got sick flu or something in this poem was supposed to cheer her up and very sweet

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
Could you say it in French it looks as hearitfirst okay it's called

44
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
Dumb ways that invalid to a

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
Sick demoiselle

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Oh my God you must have gotten so many chicks when you were supposed to go that was exactly

55
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
The opposite I was I was

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
I wish

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,320
Okay so you read the poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast forward about 20 years he publishes his first book

58
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
He becomes very popular in the publisher decides to have a transom

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
Enter the number of languages including French

60
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
In that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind of thinking what kinds of crazy things going to

61
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Happen when you translate crazy text

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
And

63
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
All of a sudden one day that poem

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
Popped into his mind I said there is a challenge

65
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Let's try to do this

66
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,504
And when you say challenge like what was it what is it what is the challenge

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Okay what I meant was

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
He says you got this if you just focus on the

69
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
This guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm sorry you're sick being sick is like prison

70
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
I cannot wish you to open your doors get out to the world clean all of them all

71
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Get out of bed eat some Jam so you don't look so pale

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
Units are like get better here's to your good health

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
YouTube want something then let me know

74
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
But just saying those words in English

75
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Misses the hole

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Spirit of the

77
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
The

78
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
Tone the lightheartedness

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
And and

80
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
Recipe for dog it also ignores The Palms Forum it's wonderfully

81
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Catchy

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines

83
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Rhyme you know aabbccdd and all the first line

84
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Is identical to the last line I mean Young

85
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Disorder has the feel of a palindrome it has the poet's name in the middle of the poem that mound of them all

86
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Did I say three syllables per line

87
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
28 lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me

88
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
So Doug sat down and got

89
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Got to work and quickly became

90
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Embroil

91
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
In the question of like how do you translate this

92
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Coming along the way

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,871
Even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the poem

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
For example

95
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Voske on data boost

96
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
Like this line the basically says don't wallow in bed

97
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
I had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the

98
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Little diagonal display here instead of spurting blood in bed instead of burping in you

99
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
Your bed instead of bursting out in benstead of lurking

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
Senior instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their

101
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Instead of squirming

102
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,359
Slurping sloppy head of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in

103
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
On and on and I came up with

104
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
You want me to read my purse translation please

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
My sweet dear I sent you all the best

106
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
Your for stressed is like jail

107
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
So don't feel very long just gets

108
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Strong go outside take a ride

109
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Do it quick

110
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
Stay not sick

111
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Band your ache for my sake

112
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,703
Buttered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that

113
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
Bad news I suggest that you'd best soon arise

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
So your eyes will not glaze

115
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Douglas praise help

116
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Be near

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
My sweet

118
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Deer

119
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Tell Claymores now Douglas became Douglas and I

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
Became Bread's buttered bread jam and jelly

121
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
They are words

122
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
But the words

123
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,887
Represent Concepts in the concept have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you

124
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Talk about jelly you're implicitly

125
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
Talking about bread and things that you spread it on oh I just think you'd like to stick their fingers in jelly

126
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
No bread needed

127
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Okay okay fair enough

128
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Feeling like you hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent the poem to one of the guys at

129
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Translated his

130
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
First book into French

131
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
A guy named oddly enough

132
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Bob French

133
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,767
I said hey Bob and you do it

134
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
And

135
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Bob said well I'll give it a try

136
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
First friend let me send my embrace

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Quit this place

138
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
It's dark halls and dank walls

139
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Insoft still

140
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Regain health

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
Grass and flea off with me Clement who calls

142
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Very different in tone

143
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
And really quite marvelous

144
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
He got the

145
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Masonry at the gym

146
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,463
Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness

147
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
The tone is much more ancient

148
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Wish you could argue well it's an ancient poem but

149
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
Text us dinner there's a bigger problem was 30 lines long so

150
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Extra-long

151
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
And what he ate was a

152
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Sacrosanct number no no no no no

153
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,271
28 lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was

154
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
A form rather than

155
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
AR

156
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Then I message that is the message was Getwell

157
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
Which is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the Forum

158
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,327
That's what made the thing funny and Charming until the question for him was

159
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Who could get the field but nail the four

160
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
To make a long story short

161
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,055
He ended up sending a poem out to like 60 people doctoral students who my sweet I am free

162
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
One regard

163
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
Otis hard dear recluse colleagues friends

164
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Chickadee I decree of find a

165
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
He's got his wife to do one Dart away from your case

166
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Engage in Brave flight

167
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
So you might flee the croup it was all bird-themed hope you swoop into ham apple jam and French bread

168
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
Running around from town to town saying hey

169
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
I got Obama anybody want to buy some Haley then if I am a person of binges this began a bin

170
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Some might say

171
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,055
And that b**** ended up becoming a 700-page book

172
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,895
Filled with translations of this poem best one now

173
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,735
This is Ben. Right right now this is not the best one

174
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,879
Stop it ok Google okay okay this is also one of his butt like a 20th wahneta

175
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
Petite gal so sweet

176
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Hug from dog

177
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
Some dumb bug dragged you down Zach that friend

178
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Feel the Earth bug zappers

179
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
From The Scourge you'll emerge in a Trice

180
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
Sound advice from a ham

181
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Ducks

182
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Clem

183
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
So smashed blue

184
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Come

185
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,639
Come you who lived the two sheets as true

186
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
Sweet let's chew

187
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
Make your heart palpitate Clem's mandate

188
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,111
Sure hope God cures your bod head to feet

189
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Should have got used your bod

190
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Although not the best

191
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,167
I do want to get to my mother's translate have here is my mother's

192
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
This was somehow

193
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
I'm going to have to look it up

194
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Pure water

195
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
Facebook is wrong complicated

196
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,479
This one from his mommy says came along years after he started

197
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Anything that might be the winner

198
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,111
Hi to its Getwell hospital prison in prison tell

199
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Get well for yourself

200
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Clements orders in a nutshell

201
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Go pig out

202
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
Open wide your mouth keep those sweetmeats going south

203
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
Unless you're hell you'll turn pale

204
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Loose poo la la. Wiggles your tail

205
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
God restores that helped you my little flower

206
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
I noticed that she doesn't

207
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Begin the poem

208
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,295
And in the palm of the same line she doesn't have 28 lines just maybe about 16 lines

209
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
She doesn't pay any attention to syllable count my first reaction was

210
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Mom come on

211
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
I didn't pay any attention to the Forum

212
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,727
And I did what I wanted to do this is my feeling and I was just leaving that's what I did

213
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,799
Actually you know I have to say

214
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
It has stood the test

215
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,455
The time it has some kind of pizzazz that no other one ever

216
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
But if she respect the forms you didn't do the syllable she didn't rhyme with the way it supposed to rhyme she didn't give you 28 lines

217
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Have that track

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Is that a translation then or is that just a

219
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
What are standard flowers bloom

220
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
As I got more and more deeply into this poem

221
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
My Philosophy

222
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Started to become

223
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Chairman Mao's

224
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
Statement let 100 flowers bloom

225
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,663
Another words you can look at it from so many angles and each new angle in riches

226
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
It is and makes it more fun but you can't read a hundred versions of every poem that you want to read okay

227
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Okay I agree are you right I guess make me question though that the Rules of Engagement and what are no rules

228
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
There no rules it's all in

229
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,863
Formal okay but there is Jim in one of the translations and ham in the other

230
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
And they're like they're

231
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Factually different

232
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
Food substances shouldn't be negotiable

233
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:03,199
I mean does a fact about the poem is that it was written by somebody in French

234
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,855
It's not in French anymore the mission

235
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
What was what

236
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Was

237
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
He said

238
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Not

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
What do we make of what he's saying what are the flavors of what he's saying what are the variance of what he say when is that like isn't the expectations

240
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
That you as a translator

241
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
AR

242
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Giving

243
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Me him

244
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
Like it is this man is lost

245
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
The time and now it's suddenly I get to experience him

246
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
What is a hundred flowers are blooming that's somehow feels like I'm not getting him at all obviously you're getting to the question of what

247
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,903
What is translation and can it be done my my feeling is that

248
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
Even though these translations that we've heard are all very different

249
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
They all

250
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Show something about claim on my ho

251
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Ducks basic point is it like

252
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Any person

253
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Kind of universe

254
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
They're too big

255
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Comprehend in their entirety

256
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
So any translation of

257
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
It's only going to get you at

258
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Tiny

259
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Piece of that pie

260
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Refraction

261
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
I'm in luck we have one photograph of Frederic Chopin

262
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
1

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Photograph

264
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
In that picture he survived

265
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Scowling

266
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
What did Frederic Chopin really look like

267
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
What was his smile like

268
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,911
You know you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say all this is what Chopin look like well no

269
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Chopin look like many things

270
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
Even the very day that that photograph was taken

271
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
He had

272
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Thousands of different Expressions on his face but then what about a year earlier or 10 years earlier I mean knowing soap

273
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,271
Open is a very complex thing it's not one thing

274
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
Millions of different things that are united

275
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
By analogy

276
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Into

277
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
Something that we refer to as one thing

278
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,335
We should say we looked into it in there are actually two pictures of Chopin

279
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
But he's kind of scallion

280
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
No smiles

281
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
Go to McDonald Cafe

282
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,823
Otoko no miss you

283
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223

Go to McDonald gospel

285
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Yeah yeah yeah

286
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Lesson number two

287
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
Are you just talking or are you doing

288
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Tupac Shakur kids

289
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Wichita Zoo

290
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Now you try

291
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Number two

292
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
I hear I hear the sound of a telephone

293
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Hello

About

307
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
Being foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps

308
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
You know when you have to go from one lime

309
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Switch to another

310
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
There's actually a really good example that I didn't use them

311
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
He's about

312
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Failure to communicate

313
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
I can tell you that story

314
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
So

315
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
So there's this word and you wouldn't think of it is untranslatable but

316
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
It's the word serious

317
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
And

318
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
When seriously seriously

319
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Crio

320
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
In my experience when you hear this word serious in East Africa or

321
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Bothell

322
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Or Stern

323
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
It actually

324
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Almost never has something to do with

325
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Your mood

326
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
But serious tends to me

327
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Is

328
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Are you just

329
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
Talking to me or you Siri

330
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
SRU

331
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Doing some

332
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
And usually doing is like

333
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Some kind of

334
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Transaction usually

335
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
AIA Financial

336
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
I've been asked by

337
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,303
How many East African officials are you going to be serious with me

338
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
And

339
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
It obviously means are you going to

340
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Can you bribe

341
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,263
Usually I pretend to misunderstand at the key moment I said yes I'm a very serious

342
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
International journalist

343
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Send

344
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
But the story that I want to tell you it

345
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
To place a couple months ago

346
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,343
I'm really pleased to be back in Africa secretary Kerry

347
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Addis Ababa Ethiopia and

348
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Enormous energy

349
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
Just a few days before Kerry's visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anteater

350
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Tarzan law that basically says

351
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
Any criticism of the government is illegal

352
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,335
I had a serious a very productive meetings this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and

353
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
Secretary Kerry was giving this press conference

354
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
I shared my concerns about the

355
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
Young Ethiopian bloggers that I met last year

356
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Not now felt like a

357
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Who

358
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
With Ava Spears

359
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
I've been in prison

360
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
And I firmly believe that

361
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,047
Set the work of journalist whether it's print journalists or in the internet

362
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Media Vatican

363
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
It makes societies

364
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Stronger he said all the things you do to expect him to say said we believe they're free speech and open dialogue important to the app

365
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Country pop

366
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,687
But we remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia

367
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Yes, it was also wrapped up in a lot of praise

368
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
And I'd be delighted to answer a few questions

369
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
Cuz I'm not sure how that's even do that

370
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Adventure Time For questions

371
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
He took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists two more from the traveling press and to carry

372
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,191
I know he was very impatient

373
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
We left the party music you know what we're just going to try something different we're going to

374
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,407
Calling an Ethiopian journalist

375
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Cherry Point

376
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Is one guy

377
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
In the second row

378
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,599
Young guy in his 20s boyish face wearing a mustache

379
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,415
I may have invited the hardest question of the day now

380
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
But Minecraft

381
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Paradise

382
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Okay so leave me

383
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Yuan

384
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
Raise doubles agents of national Foot Locker

385
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Who is a blogger

386
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Andy's friends

387
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
When does guys like well

388
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,151
Every time a journalist is arrested the US gives a statement about this but you seem so out of

389
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
This keeps happening

390
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Repeating

391
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Very much

392
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
So then he asked

393
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Question

394
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
Is it leap service or are you seriously

395
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Concerning Hobbits

396
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Zerorez

397
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Is this lip service or are you seriously concerned

398
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,935
At this point everybody they're all looking at this journalist to

399
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
Obviously it's take considerable personal rest in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state-run

400
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
TV stations guys on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrested journalist

401
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
We really we demand

402
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Say genuine safronia

403
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
And Terry looks at him

404
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Like

405
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
You've got to be kidding

406
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,119
When I stand up in public and I and I and I say something

407
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,983
I try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is Siri

408
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
And when I raised

409
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Him by name in my,

410
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
I carry sounds to me like he's sort of

411
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Insulted by the question and

412
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
So remember serious the word serious in East Africa to be translated very much his are you doing

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
Something preferably financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is

414
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,399
Are you just talkin about this or are you doing something

415
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
Maybe threatening Ethiopia with withdrawing a tour with drug support and Carrie says I am very

416
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,383
Seriously talking about we have previously called for the release

417
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
These individuals in

418
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
That is the policy of our government

419
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
And it's a serious bottle

420
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Thank you all very very much

421
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
And it seemed to me maybe you know

422
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
You can judge me

423
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
But it seemed like he was almost like

424
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in 2004 in Paris

425
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,447
Because I was being too serious by the American public

426
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,775
Like what are you accusing me of not being

427
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
Serious

428
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
We put in a number of requests

429
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but they

430
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,759
You think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry

431
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,599
This fellow

432
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Can you pronounce a name for me

433
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464

434
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,352
He's a young guy in his twenties season independent journalist

435
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
And

436
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:31,520
I was like you know when you listen what happened there and I kind of felt like this

437
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
Guide me

438
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152

Do you feel that that question put you at risk

445
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Maybe who knows that is a job description

446
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Doing good journalism in Ethiopia

447
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264

That conversation was about five months ago

452
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,088
Did you know what his fate at all I mean he found out whether did he suffer for this question in anyway

453
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
No but I have his phone number so I can give him a call and

I reached him by Skype

457
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,800
He told me that actually after that press conference he did get

458
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,664
Strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people you didn't know telling him that

459
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
He better rethink what he said

460
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624

Ethiopian anti-terrorism task force will waive social media attacks by

465
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800

And I request

512
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

513
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

514
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,312
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

515
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

516
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

517
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
To you

518
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

519
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

520
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,816
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

521
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
We're interested in the

522
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Epic moments where

523
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,008

Gopnik about George

541
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
What is George Carlin mentioned biggest Carlin It's a Wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language, the comedian

542
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120

543
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:22,496
About little Expressions we use we get we all say in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time

544
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,104
Is one of his great subject

545
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,944
He didn't even have a high school education you know so it was not something that he

546
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Got from

547
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736

And one of godnicks favorite Carlin racing I really like this one too is about how Carlin hated

549
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,232
Euphemism I don't like words or hide the truth I don't like words that conceal reality I don't like euphemism

550
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
American English is loaded with euphemisms

551
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality

552
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264
A car that was wonderful about things like that what about book called

553
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
All the way

554
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
And we brought in these

555
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Senior citizen

556
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,272
The reason we use you for so I just been through

557
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
My father-in-law died

558
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
4 months ago

559
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,672
And we went through the same horrible business that we all go through in a

560
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,512
Intensive care Ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners

561
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Have a language that they've been taught

562
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
We just want your father to be comfortable

563
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
He's Gravely ill

564
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,008
Greatly I mean she's dying right and we wanted to be comfortable means can we give him enough drug so the hill

565
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
Pass out before he dies in song

566
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
It's certainly true that

567
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Euphemism

568
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
Can be a repellent thing but

569
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
No one is full

570
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
What were mocking is

571
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
The absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that

572
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Did like dolls are reactions

573
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
Do it actually has like I have a negative effect

574
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
He has this whole bed it's about shell shock

575
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,984
PTSD in the first World War

576
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
That condition was called

577
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Shell shocked

578
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
They used to call it shell shock

579
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Not simple

580
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Honest

581
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
Direct language

582
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Cool syllables

583
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Shell shocked

584
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,784
And then it became battle fatigue battle fatigue

585
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Porsche

586
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Takes a little longer to say

587
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Doesn't seem to hurt as much

588
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
And then after became battle fatigue

589
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
Then it became operational exhaustion

590
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
Paver up to eight syllables now

591
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
Television post-traumatic shock disorder

592
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
Still 8 syllables

593
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,776
PTSD post-traumatic

594
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Stress disorder

595
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
The pain is completely buried under jargon

596
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,784
This was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blend it out the words

597
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
So

598
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,160
If you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some

599
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
Phrase interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference

600
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
PTSD we are not having the appropriate reaction to it emits shell-shocked I'll bet you if we have still been

601
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Calling a shell shocked

602
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
Some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time I'll text you that

603
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,968
Now you putting your finger on the this is where the

604
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
The rubber meets the road

605
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
Does the use of euphemism

606
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
Does that really Rob us of some understand

607
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Adam gopnik surprisingly says

608
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
The truth is just the opposite

609
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,656
We actually have more of an apparatus to help people with PTSD

610
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Then they did in 1915 to help guys with shell shock

611
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:39,872
The reason the word gets more abstract is being exactly because you have a much more complicated an abstract system of

612
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Support it's not because I think that's the reason it's called PTSD is because it's a more complex and

613
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
What that Evolution says

614
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
The initial thing was all these guys are being driven crazy cuz the shelter exploding all around me

615
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
The Western Front

616
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:01,120
Gopnik says the thinking was you know it was temporary the shell goes off loads in a moment they have a moment of shock and

617
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
They need a moment of rest and then they can go back in

618
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
But I World War II we're thinking

619
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,288
That's not quite right not just shells exploding right

620
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
It's the whole experience of battle

621
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,896
It's all the shooting in the death

622
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,480
BB guns battle fatigue you trying to generalize

623
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:21,856
Trying to make it richer as a kind of it also becomes fatigued versus shock there's less violin

624
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,232
Right because it because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but

625
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Overtime it becomes impossible

626
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,120
For them to go on is a wonderful film from World War II called let there be light

627
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
These are the casualties of the sky

628
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Cumberland mine

629
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Men who are damaged

630
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Emotional

631
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
About guys with what they were then calling

632
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Battle fatigue in the reason they were

633
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it

634
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Right away

635
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,624
Ben around Vietnam he says we realized you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly

636
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,024
Involved in battle until the question became what's the source of it it's you say well it's nervous exhaustion say the human

637
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Nervous system can only

638
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,888
Take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts down

639
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:10,496
What's the term operational exhaustion

640
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,336
The guys aren't cowards and they're behaving the way all human beings

641
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
And then

642
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
You get more concerned about them and you say

643
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
The real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield

644
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
The problem isn't that there in a constant state

645
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Of

646
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,904
Disorder because it lingers on long after

647
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,536
You think it's over you can't just get these guys into a hospital for six months and think they're going to be better they are permanent

648
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
Let you have post-traumatic shock

649
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
And then once you have a

650
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:41,728
Who has PTSD

651
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Is Justin

652
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
It's perfectly possible

653
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,872
That the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract

654
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,456
As act as people actually are becoming more empathetic

655
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
To the people who suffer from

656
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,344
Suorin do you buy a man he's too he's basically turned crown on his head

657
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
Chinese made these blender and blender words

658
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Enrichment

659
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,768
That I have any my only move would be to hit play on Carlin

660
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
Poor people used to live in slums

661
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Now the economically disadvantaged occupied substandard housing in the inner cities

662
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
I'm very broke

663
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Dead broke

664
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
They don't have a negative cash flow position

665
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,968
I'm broke

666
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
Lesson number four

667
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,952
Imagine a lot of Coca-Cola like bubbles on your tongue

668
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,816
450 Sherri Coca-Cola.

669
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Now you try

670
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,240
Pretty good

671
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,360
This is Emily

672
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,808
Some of you may remember that a couple years ago we did a story about Emily wear

673
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
She been hit by truck

674
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Going into a coma and then her boyfriend at the time Allen

675
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720
I had brought her back

676
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
My writing on her hand

677
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
She's writing her name

678
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Almost

679
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,704
All the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most

680
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
And when we left that story

681
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Emily had

682
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
Emerge from the comment again to recover

683
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
But she was blind

684
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Totally blind right yeah

685
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
Like no light any good nothing coming in now

686
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Needless to say was a very big at you

687
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
I just

688
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,904
I know I just had to develop my own ways to

689
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
Navigate

690
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
Throughout the world end

691
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Just myself and I

692
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
And being a visual artist

693
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
She had to develop new ways to draw pad

694
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Tryon

695
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,752
And if you draw the Crayons hard enough you can

696
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Feel the wax

697
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
On the paper

698
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,432
Yeah then one day in the summer of 2012

699
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
She gets a call

700
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
From the lighthouse

701
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
School in New York

702
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,344
City Lighthouse school yeah it says School for the Blind

703
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
Her mom had to found out that they were trying out this

704
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
Brand new technology

705
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,792
I think they were doing the study for the FDA experimental

706
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,888
Long story short Emily shows up the lighthouse school one day and walks into the

707
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
This room in a guy named ed

708
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
Gives her this thing

709
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
He described it I mean is it a big

710
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
No it's not it's just like

711
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
A regular pair of sunglasses

712
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,736
Though they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses

713
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Is right on the front

714
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
The bridge of the nose

715
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Was a little

716
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Camera

717
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Going forward

718
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
And then attack

719
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
2

720
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
The sunglasses was a little wire

721
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,096
It ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal is made out of titanium

722
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
And it's just like

723
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
The size of a postage

724
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
A little bit thicker

725
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,264
L6

726
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
Pizza titanium was filled with

727
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
Thousands of Electro

728
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
And what was going to happen is that the

729
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,688
Camera was going to convert images into

730
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Patterns of electricity

731
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Beyond that little square

732
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,112
So we told her to take a little square on your town right on the center of your tongue

733
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
And close your mouth

734
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
So

735
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,768
A put it on and they turn it on

736
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,912
And it was like it started to tickle

737
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Imagine a lot of

738
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,544
Coca-Cola like a lot of bubbles

739
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
On your town and always late

740
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:07,968
Prickly prickly feeling the idea behind

741
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
Science writer Sam Keen author of the tale of the dueling neurosurgeons is it we actually see with our brain not our

742
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,464
Or I might seem like our eyes are doing the singing in our ears during the hearing and

743
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
Fingers and thumb touching but that's not how it works

744
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
Each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves

745
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
And is the brain then converts those little blips into what you perceive as a sight or sound or smell no obviously

746
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,200
Someone was blind the retina is not sending those signals anymore

747
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
But

748
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
What is there is another way

749
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
To get

750
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
Signals for light and dark in color

751
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:50,976
Into all of our brains there lots and lots of Pathways going from every part of the brain to every other

752
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Other part of the brain

753
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,328
Normally your brain isn't using those pass

754
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
Is even though they exist

755
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
It's like there's a road there but it's shut down

756
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Traffic cam

757
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
But

758
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
What if you could open up some of those rats he's just let me sit with it on for an hour

759
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Our two hours we just swivel her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue

760
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,368
Young change and every time I looked around he say

761
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
Oh that's a chair

762
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Bassador

763
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
That's me

764
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
That's your mom

765
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,352
Like this for a while at shoulder a ball and it's

766
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Square plastic banana

767
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
And nothing's really happening for

768
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Except for that prickly feelings on your tongue

769
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
Then there was this moment I'd had this

770
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
Really long styrofoam Broad

771
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
And he

772
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
Plastic

773
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
In front of me he moved it

774
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
Up and down in front of my face

775
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
And I was like oh my God what was that

776
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Suddenly she says you just

777
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Thought I was like oh my God

778
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
It just happened

779
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
I don't know what it look like

780
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,352
So in my mind's eye looks like

781
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
A long way

782
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Skinny

783
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Stick

784
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,008
You see the texture of the sticker

785
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
No

786
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
I couldn't see texture I couldn't see

787
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
In three dimensions it was very flat

788
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
It is kind of like

789
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
That kids

790
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Toy Lite-Brite

791
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,368
So imagine like a black screen and

792
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
Little tiny white dots

793
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
All arranged in a line

794
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,608
To Emily was allowed to keep the brainport device for about a year-and-a-half and during that time

795
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,168
Lite-Brite resolution of a did get better

796
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
Has your brain learn to

797
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Speak tongue

798
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
It was awesome

799
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
When I saw the p

800
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,664
And one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked you about

801
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
This video

802
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Her mom had sent me showing her

803
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Wearing the device in walking down the

804
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,136
You told me that usually what you know now that she's blind when she's walking

805
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Down the streets of New York City

806
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
Especially Uptown where the streets are

807
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
A lot wider

808
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,352
She said people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around

809
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
So

810
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Isaiah

811
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,032
Yeah I hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like

812
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
I'm just

813
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
Walking alone

814
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
I can always hear the traffic

815
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
And the sound of traffic

816
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
But

817
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Not if he

818
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
People

819
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,344
What you says when you put the device on input that was sent to Iran

820
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Tongue

821
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
The sidewalk

822
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
Camelot

823
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people were on the street at the say

824
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:43,520
Same time as me and now they're all they're all there again

825
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
Almost like a painting

826
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
Really soft lashes

827
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
Everything is really soft like

828
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Soft

829
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
Roshes

830
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
Ink that can move their is walking and I can see them

831
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Legs moving and I can see them

832
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
They're gay

833
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
But I couldn't see them clearly like I couldn't see

834
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Defeater tour

835
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
Whether they were wearing a shirt or short circuit

836
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,312
Gas repairs I just like

837
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
See their Shadows

838
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
And

839
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
Every now and then I See the Light casted on them

840
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
I've mentioned smell like underwater

841
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Pictures

842
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
Squishy jellyfish like

843
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah

844
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,816
Yeah like lighting up

845
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah like that

846
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
And that for Emily is

847
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
What it's like to translate the city

848
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
With your tongue

849
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
New York City becomes is

850
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Hazy sea of

851
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
Walking fish

852
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
Make their way along in the sunshine

853
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Lesson number five

854
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:11,231
I feel like we're Futures are going to crash today

855
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
What are the best roasts

856
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Now you try

857
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,703
Next up producer Tim Howard so when I heard about this story with

858
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,775
Emily and the Brain Port I immediately called up this guy

859
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Page on which my foot is it this one

860
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,479
You might remember him I'm David Eagleman I'm a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine called him up because I can

861
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
Crosses thing that he's working on

862
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
That

863
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Is sort of like the next

864
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Generation

865
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Of crazy

866
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:44,767
It called the vest which stands for the variable extrasensory

867
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Sensory transducer

868
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,423
And it's it's a vest that you wear underneath the clothing in this vest has 24 Motors on it

869
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
Little vibratory Motors just like the ones in your cell phone

870
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
And the best

871
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,895
Connect to your phone so we pick up sound

872
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Time Warner Cable calling

873
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Valuable

874
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
Through a cell phone

875
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,159
And the cell phone does all the computational work to then convert that sound

876
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:18,559
Into patterns of vibration on the vest and you feel

877
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,959
Buzzing all over torso different Motors running at different amplitudes

878
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
It actually changes every 20 milliseconds so it's a moving pattern and it might seem impossible

879
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,967
That you could actually extract something useful about what's being said

880
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:41,087
When David brings death volunteers into the lab and have them do a particular training on the vest

881
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,207
He said that over the course of 12 Days people get really good

882
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
At word recognition

883
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,303
Somehow they begin to intuitively recognize

884
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,703
This means high for blue or chair if you tried to concentrate on it and

885
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Figure out

886
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
How each motor Translate

887
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Some part of that sound

888
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
You would never figure it out

889
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
But the good news is

890
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
You don't have to do it consciously

891
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
The brain

892
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
Is a special Aesthetics

893
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
Directing

894
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
Statistical information

895
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:16,671
And because of rain is so good at this kind of translation says David what he really wants

896
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Do

897
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
Is used as best

898
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
To create new senses

899
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
So what if you fed in stock market data

900
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,383
Converted that into the busing who did you develop in the media

901
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
Perceptual experience

902
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,991
Of the economic movements of the planets

903
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,647
And would you without having any conscious awareness of how or why you're feeling a certain way could you have

904
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,975
Having intuition like you kind of feel like oil Futures are going to

905
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Crash today

906
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
You wouldn't be

907
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Analyzing all this information you would just

908
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,399
Feel like we're also working on feeding in

909
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
You are seeing a

910
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
From minutes

911
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,335
Real time weather data from the let's say 200 miles

912
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
Around you

913
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Question is

914
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,711
Would you end up having an intuition Peekskill

915
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
That's better

916
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Then what the weatherman can tell you on the news

917
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Or

918
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
This one what if we took

919
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
500000 tweets per second

920
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,327
Cast it through some natural language processing disorder

921
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:33,727
A higher level summary of what's going on and pump all that information through the best would you develop a sense

922
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
What's happening on the planet where you suddenly say

923
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
I feel like something just

924
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Happened in Nairobi

925
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663

Canadians have Justina finalized their election of something in it

927
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:51,647
I don't know what this will be like yet but there's no reason to expect any limit on on what the brain will be able

928
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Able to develop

929
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,487
An immediate perceptual experience about

930
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,167
More experiments in translation

931
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191

Nathalie Kelley

00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
You know you get

950
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,135
A little taste of all these different things aren't there happening in the world

951
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
It really opens your eyes

952
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:03,071
She wrote a book called found in Translation in years ago a small town in the Midwest

953
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
Is just remember going to work with my dad

954
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,287
And it was a janitor and my dad said you know he actually speaks another language

955
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
Another language

956
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
On top of English

957
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
And she says

958
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
She remembers her seven-year-old brain being like wow there's a whole nother language Beyond

959
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415

Please Arabic German Italian whatever I could get my hands on

961
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,863
Connector to The Wider world but what it actually led to

962
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
At least initially

963
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,471
It's very strange job called telephone interpreting

964
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
This is how I never actually thought

965
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
To think about

966
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,383
Until now the basically when anyone calls a business and there's a language barrier

967
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,759
The operator can call switchboard and Patchen someone like Natalie for them

968
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,831
Natalie like a lot of these telephone interpreters work remotely

969
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,903
Which man should be in her house alone in a room and every few minutes

970
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,487
Hello this is interpreter 3940 how may I help you

971
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
She get a call

972
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
And it could be anything

973
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:10,143
One minute you're interpreting for could be a celebrity whose booking at hotel or restaurant in

974
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
Spain then you're interpreting for a court hearing and then you're interpreting for Hospital

975
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
I was

976
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
Well let me put it this way

977
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
I got a call

978
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
You never know where the calls going to come from

979
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:29,087
And I heard that it was a 911 call and most of these calls are actually not real emergencies

980
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
But I knew

981
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
Immediately something was different

982
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
The dispatcher was connected

983
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
And I heard

984
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
This woman whispering

985
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
On the other side of the phone

986
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
She said

987
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Muhammad Ali

988
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887

00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
He's going to kill me

990
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Oh my God

991
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
The dispatcher said

992
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Where is he

993
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
And she said

994
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Astana casa

995
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Yeah he's in the house

996
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,991
And the dispatcher said and where are you

997
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
Tabacalera,

998
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
What's that mean

999
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Under the bed

1000
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
Does he have a gun

1001
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Daytona pistola

1002
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Where is he now

1003
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
In the hallway

1004
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
What's he doing

1005
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
He's opening the door

1006
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
And then

1007
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Click

1008
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,847
Really

1009
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Yeah there is just a click

1010
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
That's it

1011
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Yeah

1012
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
You better get me about that is like

1013
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
Like if you got into it

1014
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
The connection then

1015
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
What weird place to end up in real life

1016
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:50,495
You by yourself in your room and then suddenly you're dropping in the middle of the most intense moment in a person's life but then ripped out

1017
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
Before you can know who the person was

1018
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
About to happen to them

1019
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
And then you're back in your room again

1020
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,039
That happens and then the phone rings again and then your pillows is interpreted reinforcer how may I help you

1021
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,183
And you're back to it and you're interpreting you know something is literally within a minute after that phone

1022
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,279
Call ends and the next person is probably coming to buy trading stamps

1023
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
In in in

1024
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Spanish words

1025
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Yeah

1026
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Can imagine

1027
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
What it was like be like that

1028
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Skip and jump like

1029
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607

Mystery

1034
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
This next story actually

1035
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:13,183
You should say it contains a lot of obscenities a lot of obscenities coming up a lot of strong graphic

1036
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Language

1037
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,767
If it's not something you're into or if you got kids around

1038
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,583
I would advise you to skip forward by 9 1/2 minutes

Deescalate then I stuck my thumb in my nose just since I had a booger in there

1081
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,279

It made me wonder

1099
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,463
What did I see there what was going on

1100
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,023
Jeff Ross was clearly using her

1101
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
Was Kim okay with

1102
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
What's that

1103
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
So I found a list of all the sign language translators in the state of New Jersey

1104
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,943
I'm good how are you I found her okay my name is Kim Van Cleef and I'm a certified American sign

1105
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
Language interpreter

1106
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,759
And we're here in Ocean Grove New Jersey

1107
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,623
Kim lives part of the year at end she has her entire life

1108
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,927
In a religious community on the beach

1109
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,767
And it's Ruthie comedy I'm doing religious

1110
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
Sign language

1111
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,935
Interpreting services and the choir and there's this venue nearby that does

1112
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Big stadiums

1113
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
There's any deaf

1114
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Ticket buyers

1115
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
Venues required

1116
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,567
By law to provide

1117
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
PNC called me I do all their concert all the musical concerts which I I've been doing for years

1118
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,063
Goo Goo Dolls James Tower whatever

1119
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,183
But I always can prep for them I get this setlist I go to lyrics.com I always

1120
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,535
You know cuz a lot of times I don't know the Goo Goo Dolls not like Frank Sinatra and

1121
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
You know hip-hop

1122
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
What he asked me to do

1123
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
You come in like

1124
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,983
That I didn't know what was coming at me I had no idea who any of these

1125
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,895
Course I went to know any of the comedian eventually I asked her about the whole Jeff Ross thing

1126
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,967
Basically having you harass yourself

1127
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
And

1128
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,295
I am most curious to sort of

1129
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Find you and follow up and just find out like

1130
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
How's that

1131
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
Self

1132
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,231
Well and she says the moment Jeff Ross

1133
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
Start getting raunchy

1134
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
She had a choice

1135
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
Business register's in sign language

1136
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,703
Yeah you can be formal you can be casual

1137
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Or you can be intimate

1138
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
And you can pick sides from all of those Regice

1139
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,591
Like take for example the word

1140
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
Now that the light

1141
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Way to do it with two maybe

1142
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Spell it

1143
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
So f

1144
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Uck

1145
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,599
Or the regular gesture you could do this

1146
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
Tear you giving us the finger

1147
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Two middle fingers

1148
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,207
You know there's quite a few

1149
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,607
Getting started and then there's this one that actually shows people doing the action

1150
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Two fingers on each hand and

1151
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,215
There's that you know this

1152
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:48,543
Play which is even more graphic arms out

1153
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,639
Pelvic thrust is receiving the physical

1154
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
So she had a lot options

1155
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
But with Jeff Ross

1156
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,551
She figured that what was necessary

1157
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
But this kind of intimate

1158
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:04,415
Graphic tone he was down and dirty down and dirty

1159
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
You didn't have any discomfort with any of that

1160
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:14,655
Arnetta having such a good time I really I really was enjoying it

1161
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
You asked

1162
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
Never occurred to me

1163
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,519
She was there for one

1164
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
Girl

1165
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
1 Def

1166
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,895
So there's fourteen thousand people there

1167
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
But one ticket buyer

1168
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,735
I was deaf and ask for sign language

1169
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
Just one yeah

1170
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
Young girls that with their mom

1171
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,391
But you know where this client was

1172
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
Yeah oh yeah she was

1173
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,231
In that position on the stage because she was

1174
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,511
Near where the client

1175
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Inside the whole time she's

1176
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
Sign into words

1177
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,887
The client and see her reaction can you just

1178
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Scribe

1179
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
What your client

1180
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
What's doing

1181
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:53,311
She was like oh so I figured your hand over your eyes

1182
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
She said the client when it was like a whole body cramps and I think she thought she was getting a lot of attention

1183
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
The client was mortified

1184
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,807
An intermission

1185
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
My client

1186
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
Find back to her

1187
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,671
We're going to take off and go home now

1188
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
So I'm like

1189
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,767
Has a Kim left because the client left

1190
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:19,423
Yeah we did you manage to talk to this girl at the email there I got the venue to call her

1191
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,447
But she hasn't gotten

1192
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,775
I'm suddenly feeling bad for this

1193
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
Does Similac she got a raw deal

1194
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Would you get if you had been her

1195
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
Have you been Kim would you have

1196
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
You think

1197
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
Just enjoy yourself a little less

1198
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,831
It's been a little less graphic and been a little

1199
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Less

1200
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927
Playing with the comedian

1201
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,231
I think I would have dialed it down

1202
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,023
Knowing me oh my God yeah

1203
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:49,631
You would have dialed it down he's a good man Jasmine translator

1204
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,239
A terrible translator me this is one girl in a crowd of 14,000

1205
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
Then in the transit Reserve

1206
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,591
Her not the 40,000

1207
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:03,711
She came to a comedy but it it was there in any way in which Kim had an obligation

1208
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,991
To represent the

1209
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
The client

1210
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,087
Can I see the middle between us I think that's

1211
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:14,975
And I think the correct question I think it's a fair question I mean she's not just their represent Jeff Jeff on

1212
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
No she's there too to be

1213
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,839
Mutual representative of people know

1214
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:26,239
Why do a comedy show she's in the show she's translating the show from the state

1215
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,055
Person that's what Kim said and if they're yelling

1216
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
And screaming

1217
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
Your signs are bigger your faces

1218
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,759
Exaggerated you know I made it clear to the tone that he was

1219
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Projecting

1220
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
But after that

1221
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:46,207
Do you feel bad at all did you do feel like you've lost sight of her and you started translating for the whole crowd

1222
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,023
I feel like you went Behind Enemy Lines at all

1223
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,351
She just said no she was deaf I would have done this

1224
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
The same thing

1225
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Doing my job yes

1226
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Cuz that's what a translator.

1227
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
A translator is

1228
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,567
Making what is happening up there available to me

1229
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
Not creating a middle C

1230
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,967
I guess you could argue that if she had made the choice to fingerspell

1231
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,367
So that she protected the girl you could see that from her perspective as I was saying that because she's not giving her the full experience

1232
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,927
Weird because in her making the equal

1233
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
Experience and her doing that

1234
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
She makes an X

1235
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Experience with docker

1236
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,815
Wow

1237
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Other

1238
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
Camden tell me

1239
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
She could have taken it

1240
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
Pressure intimate

1241
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
Oh no I did not

1242
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,287
No

1243
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,079
I did not go there

1244
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
I didn't casual

1245
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
Badcock

1246
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,191
The song deeper 3D pictures about

1247
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,775
Disney chocolate Auntie boots

1248
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,015
Lesson number 8

1249
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,879
How does it make the ribosomes without a ribosome to make the ribosomes

1250
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,023
Motivate Barre bedroom

1251
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Now you try

1252
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
Do you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes

1253
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
We going on an RNA fishing exposition

1254
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
What's your situation

1255
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
OKC recently we sat down with a reporter and

1256
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
And science writer

1257
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
Carl Zimmer to talk about

1258
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
RNA

1259
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
We were talking about something else in RNA chemo

1260
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:55,231
Cuz here's why ever since we started doing the show Robert got

1261
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
His

1262
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
Got his

1263
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:03,423
I got a little in system for

1264
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,751
All right I was like what do you want to do and you're like what I do or Nana's like

1265
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,359
But is there a story in your garden

1266
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:16,223
That if you understood what RNA does you'd realize that translation is

1267
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,087
Profoundly important to our existence that's why I said

1268
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,415
As I alright fine let's just try it

1269
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,071
So we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up now unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town

1270
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
I think you're at your son was getting married

1271
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:37,215
And I was doing like taking work for me

1272
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Okay alright

1273
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,055
So the definition of translation in biology

1274
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Taking a sequence

1275
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
In DNA

1276
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
And using the genetic code

1277
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943

1278
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
Translated

1279
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
Into protein

1280
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
Right and the discovery

1281
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
Of this was

1282
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,391
Maybe even more exciting

1283
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Then

1284
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
The discovery of the double helix

1285
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,047
It was bigger than the Watson and Crick

1286
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,071
Yeah well

1287
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
At least equivalent

1288
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:11,007
So here's a quick story so what happened was okay to Justice at the table here we all know the DNA is a thing

1289
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,567
And that when you're born you get half your DNA from Mom half

1290
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
Dad

1291
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,407
The Francis Crick and James Watson

1292
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Figured out

1293
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
The structure of DNA the basically

1294
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,783
The recipe of DNA your recipe

1295
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
Is comprised of

1296
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
The four bases

1297
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
Is in a long string

1298
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
See

1299
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
Angie that's it

1300
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,255
Pictures of Ramsey like we humans were more than DNA we are these

1301
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
Fleshy

1302
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,375
Peeing piles of muscle and bone and all of that

1303
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,447
All the stuff stuff of us comes from proteins

1304
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,007
We have a hundred thousand different proteins in our body

1305
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,079
Different kinds of proteins to the question was

1306
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
How does all that get generated account of the

1307
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,687
4 simple bass has become the amino acids

1308
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,503
Hundreds of thousands of proteins that make

1309
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
Us

1310
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,831
Us how do you make the translation

1311
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,135
People were thinking of this as just this

1312
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,951
Incredibly complicated problem that might

1313
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,487
Never be solved

1314
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
And

1315
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,583
The first person really think seriously about this was not a geneticist

1316
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Does cosmetologist make George camo

1317
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,423
Gamo just said wait a minute

1318
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,703
This isn't that complicated

1319
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
This is just cryptography

1320
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
This is a code 4

1321
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
Demi Lovato

1322
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
I know the DNA

1323
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,199
Is contains four bases A T C and G

1324
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:27,807
They somehow create hundreds of thousands of proteins so I just need to

1325
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,879
Think of a clever way of

1326
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,279
You know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA

1327
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,911
And then out comes the protein. What what simple code could I do to do that

1328
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,983
And just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking

1329
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,311
This guy came out decides I think that

1330
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,383
Are cells read our genes three bases at a time

1331
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,687
Like instead of 80

1332
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
CG

1333
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,039
AC, thought maybe it's ATA ccg

1334
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
TCA

1335
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:06,207
In other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA in the cell maybe it was reading it in triples

1336
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
Not pair cuz if you have sets of three rather than two game of figured

1337
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:18,751
Possibilities and that might put you on the path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins

1338
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:25,407
Now this is just a guess but surely after the double helix Duo Watson Crick and a group of other

1339
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Other scientists

1340
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Work it all out

1341
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,527
They they figured out how you get them

1342
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,087
Physically get from DNA into

1343
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Proteins

1344
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
You're so works

1345
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
Inside the cell

1346
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:42,815
The DNA sitting there all coiled up the set of molecules come along attached to it

1347
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,399
Unzip it and it got a copy of it

1348
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
This copy is now made of RNA which is like DNA very similar still in a basic sort of four letter format

1349
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,591
On the move cuz it pedals over to the

1350
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:59,967
Big old factory in the cell called the ribosome

1351
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:06,367
This crazy floppy convulsive Collective of molecules

1352
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,975
What's the RNA copy is inside this big Factory another kind of RNA

1353
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,791
Comes over and begins to

1354
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:21,727
Read my sister eat at I'm like okay ATA well that must be cool

1355
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:28,127
GGC well that's going to be and it begins to create this chain of amino acids

1356
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:32,223
King of proteins and eventually the ribosome will take this chain and

1357
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
Ejected out

1358
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,879
So that they can go grab oxygen or

1359
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
Cut up your food or make your hair or the

1360
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
The cartilage

1361
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
In your ear your teeth

1362
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
The neurons that carry the thoughts you think whatever

1363
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
What does disp

1364
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
Place the

1365
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Quote author

1366
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
Of you

1367
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
Cuz I I mean I remember growing up thinking no DNA is my sort of like manual my blueprint or something all of me is in there and

1368
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,431
System Outlet opens and then out pops me

1369
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,223
But you're saying that there is this

1370
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,271
Sting that is reading these three base pairs

1371
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
Forming any of a

1372
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,343
100000 proteins

1373
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,695
Suddenly I'm thinking that's where the game is nuts not the DNA but in the thing at 3 Midday and

1374
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:18,047
Well yeah I mean DNA is just a totally meaningless molecule just flopping around

1375
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
Unless

1376
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
There is a way of

1377
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Reading it

1378
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,727
Doesn't the build that they're they're the reader of the DNA come from the DNA

1379
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Trip to that's just weird

1380
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,823
CW app so you have jeans for

1381
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
The parts of the ribosome

1382
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:35,455
At this point a producer Tim Howard and Stern wheeler

1383
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
It's like a book

1384
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
That

1385
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,063
Birth its own reader

1386
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:45,439
That's that will read the book not exactly though because that does you you are certain

1387
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
Putting DNA pain

1388
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,559
That pedal store

1389
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,607
Sequential it is it's it's it's first

1390
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
Indiana House DNA

1391
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,519
What you're saying is it in the order of events you begin with DNA and then after that

1392
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
Get the ribosomes

1393
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
Events of what

1394
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
Of you

1395
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,431
Okay but but you got to bear in mind that you

1396
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:11,039
I don't know how far back you want to go with you where do we start with you

1397
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
Do you want to start

1398
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
Jazz the fertilized egg

1399
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
Well hello

1400
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
Sure yeah okay

1401
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,487
Chad the fertilized egg has DNA

1402
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Annie's ribosomes

1403
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
House of the Breeders already present

1404
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
When a cell divides

1405
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,423
Two new copies of DNA go into

1406
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,751
Each new cell but they also divided up all the ribosomes

1407
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
From the original cell

1408
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
So they're taking the factories with

1409
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:38,175
So you the DNA is never without

1410
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
The code

1411
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Okay so it's like Moses

1412
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,783
With the tablet

1413
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Together

1414
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
Regular is a Noah can I just have never thought of it that way so I might need to think about

1415
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,167
What makes the ribosomes then

1416
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,215
Is it come from the DNA I thought you just said that

1417
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Yes it is how does it make the ribosome without a

1418
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,615
Directions on to help it make the ribosomes

1419
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Wait

1420
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,223
Translator

1421
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,783
DNA code to the ribosomes how do you

1422
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
Make the ribosome without a

1423
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
Ribosome to translate

1424
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
The code to make the rabbits

1425
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,183
You couldn't wait a second

1426
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,279
I'm so confused right now to take the DNA and the ribosome

1427
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Partnership

1428
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
All the way back

1429
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
Do billions of years

1430
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Zeze

1431
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
2

1432
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
Parts of the system

1433
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,263
Evolve and became dependent.

1434
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Are there very early in his

1435
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,359
Fat girl says a lot of biologists think

1436
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
The life

1437
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Started out

1438
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
As just

1439
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
RNA

1440
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
No DNA

1441
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,527
And so you would basically have

1442
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,087
Little little organisms that would

1443
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,647
Have these little kind of Proto genes made of RNA

1444
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Eventually

1445
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,767
These RNA molecules started to connect

1446
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,791
Amino acids

1447
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,351
To make a little building blocks

1448
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
The proteins

1449
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
So you're saying that

1450
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
People generally think RNA came first

1451
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,799
That is one of a couple leading

1452
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Okay

1453
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,151
So it's possible that darnay came first

1454
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Then DNA

1455
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,527
Somehow it suddenly I'm thinking we shouldn't talk about RNA all the all along

1456
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Twilight

1457
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,879
I mean just in general RNA has been incredibly

1458
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
