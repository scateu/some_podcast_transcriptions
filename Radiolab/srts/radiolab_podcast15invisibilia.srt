1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you awake

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,456
End NPR

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
What up ladies

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
Hey

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
How's it going Chad it is it is indeed

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
This Radiolab

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Robert Nye invited to folks into the studio are former producer loomiller basically started the

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,728
Show with us sleeping in the Sonic ID

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
You're right there

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,152
Weather in and also Elise Spiegel reported NPR

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
Because Lulu Annaliese together are starting new radio show the podcast and everyone's very excited about

13
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
What it's called invisibilia look like a Latin word was that the Latin word it's a name that my mother

14
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
Came up with this is Elise talking

15
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,912
Cuz she's a French beautiful historian so they just like no stuff like that under what circumstances did

16
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Just come up since you know hanging the way that this beagles hang in like her bedroom

17
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,128
The show is about it's about all these

18
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,712
Invisible things are invisible but they're expecting you in

19
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
What's the name and she was just like why don't you just call out invisibilia

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
I was like

21
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
And misled for what

22
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Invisible things

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
So the show promises to be sort of an investigation

24
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
Of all the invisible things that

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
Guide our behavior that we generally don't see now

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,056
They've been sharing some stories that they've been working on as they're going

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
A lot of it is

28
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Amazing

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,248
So we we ask them for the preview one of their stories for you guys

30
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
This one they're going to hear

31
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,904
Comes from an hour that they're producing on the topic of

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Categories

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Like the different boxes that we put

34
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,608
Things in our world into and the first piece in the show looks at one of the most

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Basic categories that there is

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
The first question that any

37
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,288
But he asks a parent who has a new baby is it a boy

38
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Or girl

39
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,712
I have to say in my career I have done a number of stories about a blurring between

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,600
Boy and girl but the story I'm about to tell you is that a kind of flooring that I have never heard of

41
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
4

42
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
This is a person I met who calls herself Paige abendroth abendroth means the color of

43
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,192
The sky when it's that deep red right before the sunset

44
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,544
Paige had bright blue eyes long black hair in a ponytail

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Good make yourself

46
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
We were in San Diego by the way setting ourselves up to talk I'm going to make you scoot

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
Skit skit skit skit

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Caduceus good

49
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
So after we sat down I asked page

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Show me some pictures of herself

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
From about a decade before

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
So there aren't many

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
In the pictures

54
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Was a man

55
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
A man in a naval uniform

56
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
He was very buff

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
Strapping military

58
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
High and tight haircut

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
And there they were

60
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Those bright blue eyes

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,664
You look very you look pretty conservative here to yes I do

62
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Page

63
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
But the first three decades of her life as a man

64
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
But let me be clear from the top

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,024
Paige's story is not a transgender story that you typically hear

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Typically

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,912
People who are transgender feel like they are one gender trapped in the body

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Of the other gender

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,568
Their internal gender identity is misaligned with their biological sex

70
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
But

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
It's static

72
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
It stays the same

73
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
But when I was talking to Paige

74
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
That

75
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Didn't capture

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Her experience

77
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
At all

78
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Because when I met her

79
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Paige was flipping

80
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
Flipping between the category mail

81
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
And the category female

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
My foot back and forth multiple times a day

83
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
Snab spend

84
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
20

85
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Percent

86
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Of my time

87
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
In game mode and the rest of it and female mode one morning page would wake up feeling strongly that the gender at

88
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
Core of her being with female

89
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
But then suddenly it's just kind of like

90
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
There was a change

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
And Paige

92
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Was in die mode

93
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
When that happened

94
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
All kinds of things about page change

95
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Her posture changed

96
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
In my weight kind of moves up to my shoulders

97
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,703
Like my center of gravity is kind of up here more significantly she told me

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
There was a real psychological ship

99
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
The way I see the world in the way I interpret the world is different

100
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
When Paige was in mail mode

101
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Page was less interested in people and talking to them and making eye contact with them

102
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
One more introverted him a lot more

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm quieter button female mode

104
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
She was much more

105
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Expensive

106
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
And sights sounds smells likes dislikes

107
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
They were all different when I'm female

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
All might

109
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
Emotions are like this really Vivid

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Eye colors

111
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Basically

112
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
Page with constantly and very abruptly

113
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Bounce

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,527
Between two starkly different ways of being in in filtering the world

115
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Paige wasn't able to dictate

116
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
When or where this happened I really have no control over it

117
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,255
She be sitting in her office talking to her boss and

118
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Damn

119
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
She'd be walking down the street

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Damn

121
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
Now when this happened

122
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,287
It wasn't like page was an entirely different person I'm always the same person

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
I experience the world differently

124
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,687
But I'm still me I still in the control of myself I still have my same

125
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Wants and desires

126
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
There was just as profound

127
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Difference

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Beneath everything

129
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
It's just a sense of knowing like

130
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
The way that you know you're a female right now without having to be told

131
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,119
It's the same way that I know that I'm a female and when I'm a guy it's the same way I know I'm a guy it's just

132
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
This instinctual knowing

133
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
What I am

134
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,407
By the way right now are you male or female

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
And how long have you been in girl mode right now

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
About an hour

137
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
I'd say

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
So

139
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Maybe you're thinking that page

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Seems nuts

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Peter self

142
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
Has had that thought I thought that I was going crazy

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah I mean some people first

144
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Sure about this

145
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
You don't think me wonder if it's dissociative identity disorder which is formerly known as multiple personality disorder

146
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
Or a form of psychosis

147
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
This is Laura case

148
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,223
A researcher who has worked in the lab of a very famous neurologist a minion

149
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,623
Vs ramachandran UCSD and a couple years ago they got an email from a woman describing exact

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
Actually the same kind of experience that page describes

151
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
Someone who experiences

152
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
The switching back

153
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
Come forth and while on the one hand they were dubious

154
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,215
Get a lot of interesting emails and our lab emails from people claiming all kinds of

155
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Wild sounding experiences on the other hand

156
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
They study the brain and they have seen brains

157
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
Do all kinds of things they've seen brands

158
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
That suddenly stopped recognizing faces

159
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
Brands that think their owner has a mysterious limb

160
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
So they were curious

161
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,279
Here's a person who goes back and forth in terms of what their brain seems to be telling them about whether male or female

162
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,631
How fascinating would that be to look and see what could be changing in the brain

163
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Or the environment to

164
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Be causing that shift and identity

165
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
So they decided to look into it

166
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
The past couple years case has found

167
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Dozens of people with experience

168
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,735
And cheese has started testing them in different ways

169
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
Including getting them psychological screening

170
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,879
And what she found was that as a group

171
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,207
These people are not mentally unstable

172
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
They simply don't have dissociative disorder none of them had any form of psychosis or anything like that they

173
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
Table that bipolar schizophrenia

174
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
And saw some other interesting things

175
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
They were actually a little bit more ambidextrous

176
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
In the general population

177
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Basically they found enough to suggest that there might be something neurological going on so they

178
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
They published a very very small study of columnar SRT-4 part in a journal called medical hypotheses

179
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,463
And then started on another study but we're not not ready to

180
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
Talk about the data from that study

181
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
I did though get one

182
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Tidbit

183
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
About this from case

184
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
And again this is very very very very preliminary

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
But she found that the same person will perform differently on certain tasks depending on whether they are

186
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Are in male or female mode

187
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
For example

188
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
She gave the same person these mental puzzles

189
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
The test

190
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Spatial and language abilities

191
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,951
And Lulu you know how men are really good at supposedly

192
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Men are really good at kind of

193
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Spatial directions

194
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
They're like spatial manipulation

195
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
What does that mean

196
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
I don't know how to explain it exactly but like you're a woman so you wouldn't understand so I wouldn't understand it

197
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Great Wall right

198
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,919
Like take a geometric shape rotated in your mind

199
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Stuff like that okay

200
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
They found when they gave these tests to these people

201
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
When they were in their difference

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
States that have different abilities so wow

203
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
So like when they were men they performed more as men and when they were women they performed more as women

204
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah we did see some

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,495
Differences between gender states that were intriguing but not conclusive

206
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Here's the point

207
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
There's some evidence

208
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
That the shift these people say that they are

209
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Experiencing

210
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Could

211
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
B-real

212
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Which brings us back

213
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
2 page

214
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,951
And I wake up in the morning like a my male and a female I wanted to talk to her about what it was like

215
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
To move in this way

216
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
Between categories

217
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
So let's just start with

218
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Like your childhood

219
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
Now page didn't start off

220
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Swag

221
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
She started off as a he

222
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Who really

223
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
Didn't even have that experience that you sometimes hear about

224
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
Where people describe feeling from a very early age like

225
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:06,111
They're trapped in the wrong body

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
He was a boy obsessed with the things

227
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
That most boys are obsessed with I always thought about women

228
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
You never thought you were yet

229
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,375
Paige said there were these strange momentary flashes

230
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
That were disturbing

231
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
I remember looking at

232
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Girls

233
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,103
Not just being attracted to them but thinking that I was supposed to be

234
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Them

235
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,247
And wishing that I could kind of go over to the girl group and be accepted because that's the way I felt I should be

236
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
But these thoughts are really inconsistent it's not

237
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
I didn't always feel that way

238
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Grows up graduates from high school

239
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
Goes to college and then really starts to struggle the Flash's RC

240
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,751
Still there college is hard page drops out and begins to feel really really

241
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,359
And then in a somewhat odd place

242
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Paige finds relief

243
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,015
In the Navy by love the discipline of it the structure of it

244
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
Football for some reason

245
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
Those flashes

246
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Go way down

247
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Why

248
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,047
I don't know I saw myself as being more of a guy than I ever did before

249
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
But really

250
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
It was while stationed at a naval base in Japan

251
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
The page found relief

252
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
In a way that will be familiar to many of you I walked around the corner and I saw her and she's kind of bouncing around and she

253
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
She's very energetic and

254
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
It was love at first sight

255
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
Immediately I knew that there is something like special about her

256
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,575
And even though Cajun never been a very aggressive person

257
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
Page completely went after this girl I was smitten

258
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
I was immediately smitten

259
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
And it worked

260
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
We're just like this we're so in tune with one another

261
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
I mean we knew each other so good we can communicate like with a series of clicks

262
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
Like what do you mean

263
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Unlike the other first of an answer back and we know what we are like

264
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Getting at and sometimes with mean like someone like how are you or it could just be acknowledging that

265
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
You know you're there

266
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,743
So began the best chapter in Pages life

267
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
They get married

268
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Skinless cat

269
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Fornia

270
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
Got a home car at a steady job I had everything

271
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Did I ever wanted

272
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
What does that mean

273
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
It depends on the context

274
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
And then page turns 30

275
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
And all of a sudden

276
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Start feeling really really tired

277
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
I'd means coming up the steps I would run out of breath

278
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
So page

279
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Goes to see the doctor

280
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:07,615
And eventually what they finally figured out was that my body thought it'd be really fun joke on me

281
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
To us stop producing testosterone

282
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Basically at 30 years old

283
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,319
I had a testosterone level of an 80 plus year old man

284
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
To the doctors put page on testosterone replacement therapy

285
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
And very quickly

286
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
The exhaustion went away I felt like I had before

287
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
But

288
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
The flashes

289
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
They're back

290
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
With a vengeance

291
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
I would have those feelings again where I thought I was supposed to be female except

292
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
It wasn't there isn't anything subtle about it it was very strong

293
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,199
Feeling that something had gone terribly wrong

294
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
And that

295
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
I was not supposed to be male

296
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
In these moments page would look down at her body this hard

297
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
Torso covered in hair

298
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,191
And feel better discussed imagine you woke up in your body was

299
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Cockroach it was really unsettling did you so did you start talking to

300
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Your wife about it

301
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
No I was terrified

302
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
I thought I was going crazy

303
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
I didn't want her to think less of me

304
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
And that is something that I kept inside

305
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,607
Page started telling me that occasionally during this.

306
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,263
He's this feeling of disgust that came over her when she flipped into female mode but had a male body

307
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
She would secretly put on women's clothing

308
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,199
She felt the need to cover this body that felt so wrong

309
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
With clothes from the right side

310
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
It's just I was just trying to do anything I could to

311
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
To make myself feel more female

312
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
So

313
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
I started asking questions about the

314
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
Remember the first time you decided to do that

315
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
But suddenly

316
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,631
The whole tone of the conversation changed

317
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
I want to talk about it

318
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
The wind was so after that one

319
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Do you need to take a break

320
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Uncle

321
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,391
Yes you're cool you want to do

322
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Paige got up

323
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
And disappeared around the corner

324
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
I could hear the faucet running in the bathroom

325
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,191
And when she came back she wanted me to know something if it matters I flipped back into game mode

326
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
Okay so that is that why you don't want to talk

327
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
It's just kind of like

328
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
It's different now

329
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Live in Tagalog I mode

330
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
Was it when your eyes closed that you flip into car mode

331
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
I don't know

332
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,975
So are you in a bad mood right this second

333
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
So is it hard to answer questions

334
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Okay

335
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
I'll be okay I just need like

336
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,263
We sat awkwardly for a while neither of us

337
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Quite sure what to do

338
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
It did feel like there was a difference in

339
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Even in the way that she talk

340
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
How to how are you doing I'm good

341
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Are you male or female

342
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
Okay is that okay

343
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Text you when you do it in just one minute after we take a quick break

344
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,351

And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show and I've request

351
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

352
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when

353
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
So did something

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

355
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you said

356
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Suddenly noticed they were doing math class

357
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Reading music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in the

358
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
Does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

359

00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
The tale

365
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,039
Page explained that the next chapter of her life involved finding a name for what was going on with her

366
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Bigender

367
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,647
People who consider themselves both female and male

368
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
At the same time

369
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
She found it in the by gender website

370
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,791
And though only a small portion of

371
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
People on the website

372
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Describe

373
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Flipping like page

374
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
It felt like

375
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
This could be an explanation

376
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
The way I felt was

377
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,895
Other people felt that way and it was it was real it wasn't you know just some weird psychological constructs

378
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
But with this validation

379
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Came a horrible realization

380
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Page

381
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Had to tell her what

382
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,439
I told her that we needed to talk and so sat down and separate chairs

383
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
I think I was on the couch and she was on a

384
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Recliner

385
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Paige was terrified

386
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
She was certain that our marriage would be over

387
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
And she was very visibly upset

388
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Sorry

389
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
I was just

390
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Begging her to

391
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Not believing

392
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Accept me for who I was

393
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,135
I couldn't live for her for so long

394
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
I didn't know I could love

395
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,423
But two pages surprise

396
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
Her wife said it's okay

397
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
She told me that everything is going to be okay

398
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
And that

399
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
You know we're going to make this work and

400
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
She wasn't going to give up on me

401
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,952
Paige couldn't believe how lucky she was

402
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Together

403
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,560
They walk into the space between categories

404
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
Some mornings pagewood wake up male

405
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
The husband her wife and married

406
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
That man would put on male clothes

407
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Go to work

408
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Other mornings

409
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Pagewood wake up female

410
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
A woman trapped in this strange body

411
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
And they were doing it

412
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Helping each other through life in this odd space

413
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
But one problem

414
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,352
As much as the two of them could get used to the idea of flipping

415
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Page

416
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
Couldn't get used to the physical experience of it

417
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,824
I came out of the shower one day and I'd gone in and game-mode I came out and female moan

418
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,432
She was standing there beginning to dry off and I saw myself in the mirror

419
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
And I was so disgusted that I threw up

420
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
These kinds of feelings

421
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
Happened all the time

422
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
Had come across a potential cure for this

423
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,328
I sort of Homespun remedy that some of the bigender folks handwritten about online

424
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Involves hormones

425
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
Page would go on estrogen

426
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
To make her body more androgynous

427
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Bring my body to

428
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
Androgynous point

429
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Or I could resent

430
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,736
Both as either male or female it would reduce the shock

431
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
Of being thrown between category so violently

432
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
If her body was in a permanent state of in between

433
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
So page

434
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Decided to try it

435
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
She began estrogen treatments

436
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
And it worked

437
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
That the first time I got my first injection

438
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,752
I just felt this immense relief like I was finally on the right track

439
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
There was no longer the same physical discomfort

440
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
But

441
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,224
As page finally was becoming comfortable in her own body

442
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Page's wife

443
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Started to turn away

444
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,184
The begin sleeping in different bedrooms it was almost like we're becoming strangers

445
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,792
And the point where I realized that

446
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
You know she wasn't suddenly going to

447
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
I don't know

448
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Tried really hard

449
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,456
But it's really difficult

450
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
When things don't have a clear category

451
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
That's scary

452
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
For us all

453
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
There a ship we don't recognize

454
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
I felt like

455
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Monster

456
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
I felt like

457
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
Who is terrible like alien creature that

458
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
It come down

459
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
And take it over

460
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,616
Her husband's life in

461
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
Taking him away from her

462
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
One night I heard a crying in the bathroom

463
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
And I asked if everything was okay and she said no

464
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
She said it's over isn't it

465
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
And I think the next day she told me to move out

466
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
I am mourn for my marriage the same way I would mourn for like

467
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
You know the death of

468
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
None of my mother or someone who I was really really close with

469
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
In Tennessee right now

470
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
It's really hard to talk about still

471
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,672
Sitting there in Paige's apartment

472
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
The afternoon light fitting in the window behind her

473
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
I was just struck

474
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,096
My how hard her situation was

475
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
It's not just the fact that page

476
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
Wasn't in one clear gender category

477
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,312
She was stuck between categories in other ways as well

478
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
In the weeks before and after our visit

479
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
I had called around

480
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,248
Trying to get a handle on how to make sense of this experience

481
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
The people like page describe

482
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368
I had spoken to all kinds of people

483
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
Therapist historians gender researchers

484
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,560
But it seems like a lot of the people that I spoke to

485
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
We're convinced

486
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
The experience I was describing

487
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Didn't

488
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
Really exist

489
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,848
There's no way they're actually flipping between genders I was told

490
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,200
By two different gender researchers into different European countries

491
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
These people are just psychotic

492
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
Both of the men who told me this

493
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
And worked in gender research

494
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
For their entire professional careers

495
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
And they sounded extremely confident

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,328
A gender therapist in San Francisco with also skeptical

497
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
But she had a different reason

498
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
These people are actually just normal transgendered people she explained in the sense that the Earth

499
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,128
Experiencing the same thing that any transgender person experiences

500
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
They've just developed a different way of describing it

501
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Same experience

502
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Different label seem to be her argument

503
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
In other words

504
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,392
It's not just the page

505
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
Was existing between genders

506
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Problem was even more

507
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
Most of the people that I talked

508
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
2

509
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
Didn't seem to believe that the experience that page

510
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
Was saying that she had

511
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Was real

512
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
Why do you think this happened to you

513
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Where does this come from in you

514
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
I don't know

515
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,696
I have stopped asking myself that because it doesn't matter anymore

516
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
I just kind of animal I am

517
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
When we talked

518
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
Paige seemed as mystified by what was happening to her than anyone else

519
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
But her experience

520
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
She concluded

521
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Was her experience

522
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
There wasn't that much he could do about it

523
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
But my biggest worry is that I'm never going to really fit in

524
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,528
Tell a female spaces or male spaces are afraid that I'm going to be

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,392
Living the rest of my life and some kind of weird gender Twilight Zone

526
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
What will you do then

527
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
I don't know

528
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
I keep on doing my best

529
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
More than a year after we first met I called

530
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
On page app on the phone

531
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
I wanted to check in and see how she was doing

532
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,248
It was clear from the very first moment she answered

533
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
But something was different

534
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
Her voice sounded different

535
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Higher

536
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Hi can you hear me

537
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
Turns out about six months after I went to San Diego

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
The flipping started to fade

539
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
And eventually

540
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
Paige had settled full-time and being a woman

541
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
The last time page and flipped

542
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
In tubing psychological email

543
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
Was in the fast food restaurant Five Guys

544
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
And she said it took her completely by surprise

545
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
I've gotten so used to

546
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Country sayings like I am

547
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
I like a woman that

548
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
I thought it had stopped

549
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
And I remember I slept really hard

550
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,160
It was it was really bizarre felt like I was wearing

551
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
I really uncomfortable sweater or something like that

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,888
The page couldn't really explain why the flipping had stopped any better than she could explain why it it started

553
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,008
She said she saw the estrogen hormones you taken to make your body more androgynous

554
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Probably had affected her

555
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:06,944
And Laura case the researcher who's been studying people like page agrees that hormones do effect

556
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Brain

557
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,040
But still there was no way to be absolutely certain

558
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
But it was one thing

559
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
The page seemed absolutely clear about

560
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Living in one category

561
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,072
Even if it's a category that's often discriminated against like transgendered women

562
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Is way better

563
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
And having no category

564
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Oh my goodness

565
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,056
It's so much easier it's so much more manageable

566
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
The world

567
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
Tumi just in makes so much more sense

568
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Now page new which was supposed

569
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
To do

570
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Where she could place her foot

571
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
She didn't have a wife

572
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
But she did have that

573
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
What I really want to know since I have never heard of anybody like

574
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,624
Like I didn't know this was this was in the inhuman experience are there a lot of these

575
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
People is is there at 3 so I have spoken

576
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,424
To maybe six people who have alternating gender incongruity who flipped their by gender and they kind of

577
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,776
Move between their genders in this white cuz there are lots of different ways of being bigender right

578
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:42,688
And click thing is I differ

579
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Yes

580
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
So they they had that too

581
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Yes

582
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Any idea what

583
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,904
Causes those sudden flips at exactly what lowercase is trying to understand

584
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,512
Think she has about 26 of these people that she has been talking to and

585
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
So she has been talking to these people but I don't know that it's

586
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
Clear yet it could be biological or

587
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
It could be

588
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:09,312
A different kind of disorder it could simply be a different way of

589
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,456
Conceptualizing and experience that a lot of different people have we can't even say

590
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,832
This is a condition with a strong in Sharpie marker

591
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
Declaration of now there's a name

592
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,208
And now this exists like there could be

593
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
Hundreds of thousands of people privately

594
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Sitting with this

595
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
And if

596
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
If that name came out

597
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,216
Maybe they'd suddenly have a place but the name right now itself is like

598
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:43,104
In Gray translucence what is the name again it's alternating gender incongruity

599
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,176
Boy you're saying is this is really a mystery

600
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
You don't really know what happened in the story really

601
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
What is the scientist

602
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
I mean that's

603
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
That's it is in no

604
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
