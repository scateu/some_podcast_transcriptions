00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,096
Eggs job before we get started on the podcast

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
Two things

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,424
First the MailChimp challenge with a little while back

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,216
We did

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
You guys did it

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,568
Media West if a certain number of you who became

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Sustaining members MailChimp

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
Pigeon with money

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
It happened

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
We're super great

11
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
Thank you

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
We did it

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey number 2

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,600
I want Elena that toward the end of this podcast

15
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
About to happen

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Wait wait haven't been setup yet

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,072
You guys want to hang out until the

18
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
The Alice Echo

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,168
Why why do we have to be at the end

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
Can we just be up top

21
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,592
But that was the deal we talk this is my Rosa Parks moment and you know why we can say that is

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Because we are

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
You're putting me in a box here at the end of this podcast

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
Come back and introduce you guys listening to two very funny people you just heard Phoebe Robinson Jessica Williams they're starting to pod

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
C Studios

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
2 Dope Queens

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
It's awesome

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
We'll talk about it

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
I see you got to hang out

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Yeah yeah

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Are you awake

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,616
Listening to Radiolab

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,480
Radio WNYC

34
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
Jad and Robert Radiolab

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm going to just tell you the store

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
Just very briefly I'm going to tell you the story of three

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Enormous mister

38
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
Pistou but you know very well and one of which I bet you've never heard of ever

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Okay

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
Mystery number one

41
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
This is the one I know where the one I don't see the one you know

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
So about

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
4 billion years ago

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
The Earth is one

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
Huge mostly ocean of lifeless chemical

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
And then for some reason we have never really been able to understand lifeless chemicals suddenly

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Per diem

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Opposed

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Can you get

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
Life hello yes I was just arrived.

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Lake Macbride map

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,144
Nick Lane I'm a professor of evolutionary biochemistry

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,496
University College in London Nick is the main guy in the story I'm about to die

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
But just to continue this setup

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
If you're number one where does lice come from

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Next

57
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Mystery number 3

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
To make it morning

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Think what about the two who is going to be the subject of the story and more important the middle one is the Deep

60
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm surprised because you've never heard of it so I thought I would skip over to

61
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,792
To remind you how familiar you are with one-in-three holler at fine go to 3 and then come back at 2

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Drake

63
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Conscious

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
For some reason

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,288
For some reason one animal on the planet and only one that we could always seems to spring into this

66
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
Very elaborate sense

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,432
Of self-awareness we don't know why it happened you don't know how it happened

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
It just did it right

69
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:06,624
I'm familiar with 1-2-3 if you are not here is number two that's the one that keeps Nick up at night because

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,256
Does a kind of a gap a black hole with everything important in biology happened

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
We have very little insight into

72
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
What what it was

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Black hole in biology

74
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
If you want to know what it is this black hole

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,824
Do you know you do

76
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Mystery number

77
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
They were a little bit past 1 move away before 3

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,576
4 billion years ago we got life is just floating around

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
Blue specks in the ocean

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Are very simple cell

81
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Probably pretty much like code of a bacterium as we know them today this is very small. If you're looking at the

82
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Period at the end of a sentence a is it about that size or smaller

83
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
A couple of

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Thousands of a millimeter long

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
So tiny tiny things

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,968
They all look the same in this size and shape and they don't seem to be doing anything very interesting

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
They were having babies and they were using energy

88
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
But if you look inside one of these

89
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Things

90
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Not much going on

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,583
Is race replays often described as a bag of chemicals there they're not complex they're not

92
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
Complex simple simple as can be

93
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
And it goes on like this for millions of years and then

94
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
100

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
What ready to building is also

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
2 billion year

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
If not longer

98
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
You just have tiny tiny some

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
Chinese symbol bobbing bobber

100
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Babysitting

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Something in the way

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,695
Poppin Poppin Poppin Poppin nothing nothing nothing nothing wrong with it

103
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Three good reason there is

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
You should know there is no rule which says life has to get bigger

105
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
We could have stayed

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Infinitely small

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
100 billion years

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
Really yes really but then said something

109
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
As they say about 2 billion years ago all of a sudden practically overnight

110
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,367
A new kind of Life shows

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
And it's huge

112
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
At least first one

113
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
The actual volume when our around about ten thousand times bigger massive increase in size

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Like we just jump from specs

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,639
The battleships and inside these things

116
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
Massive pieces of complex machinery

117
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Becomes bigger

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Bigger and more complex It ultimately

119
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Leads to

120
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Jellyfish

121
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,183
Giant redwood trees beluga whales

122
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,047
Beluga caviar wishes baby whale

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,191
Nevermind cherry trees hurdles Library tarantulas elephant

124
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Paradise

125
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Here's your second mystery

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
How did life for such an enormously long time safe

127
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
So simple

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
So dull and so tiny and then

129
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
You got these big life-forms

130
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
What happened

131
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
And why did it not

132
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Happen for such a long time

133
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,047
Well I are you going to enlighten me with such as to answer is yes but I want you to remind you this is a few

134
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
When making a hypothesis

135
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,751
Who knows really exactly what happened during we're never going to get whenever going to find life

136
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Found footage

137
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
That moment right

138
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,919
We can we can only imagine if we can only use the evidence we've got now

139
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
That is it young I'm a science writer at the Atlantic

140
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,831
It's the guy who introduced me to Nick Carlson X work and

141
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Experiential here's the important thing to

142
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,767
I'm not doing those two billion years when nothing much happened but life didn't get it

143
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
It it's that life

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Couldn't get caught

145
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
There is

146
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
A barrier there is an energetic

147
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Canyon

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
But simple cells

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Find themselves

150
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
What

151
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
It means that it's a huge deal

152
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
Should try to get thinking about what it takes to get bigger

153
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
Six-figure cell wall

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Fix my Surface

155
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
More openings let things in which they got more power in my moving parts and then to make the whole thing fit and work together you got to have

156
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
A bigger design planets or DNA so you're going to need more DNA

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
And all that DNA needs to be copied

158
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,679
You're going to need some DNA copy I need to read the information that's encoded within it

159
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
Do you need to use that information to build proteins and some Builders I'm about lost but this is

160
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Especially costly

161
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
So you don't get bigger

162
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Free every new Step takes extra energy

163
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
Just like if you were going to you know if you're going to increase the size of your company by a thousand times if you're going to have a

164
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
A thousand times more employees

165
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
You're going to need to pay them all

166
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Where you going to get the money

167
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
I mean you and I we might be able to go to a bank

168
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
Little thing you don't have any place to

169
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
How do you get bigger

170
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
I mean can't you just eat

171
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
More food than you normally eat

172
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
So that you get more energy so that slowly over time to get bigger

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
I mean by you could do that

174
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
But suppose you don't have to

175
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Stomach to absorb

176
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
You make a stomach somehow

177
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
The stomach

178
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
You got to eat more food to build

179
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Eat more food you can have the stomach when you can't really have the stomach let you eat the food you can't eat the food what you have.

180
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,839
You just stuck in a hole kind of a catch-22

181
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
Yeah you're sucking what what could cause a young and energetic

182
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
And climb over the walls of that Canyon and to start

183
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Experimenting with complex

184
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
You need something improbable

185
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
You need something very special

186
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,087
So special and so improbable that according to this Theory over the course of all of our planets has

187
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
That has only happened successfully

188
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Once

189
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
What what happened

190
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
But here's the thing

191
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
His life

192
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Bopping along it's boring boring

193
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Boring way everything is

194
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Very tiny

195
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Very simple and then one day

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
Two single celled

197
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Creatures

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Start to drift

199
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Gorgeous women.

200
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,479
One of them is an archaean little Bob and one of them is a bacterium

201
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Under The Blob

202
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
They they belong to the two great houses of simple things in with the montagues and capulets

203
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Solve 2 billion BC

204
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
These two little cells start to get near each other slowly

205
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,727
It was he sell One Soul the other one has to offer Nick imagines that I don't know maybe the little one was

206
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
Expelling some kind of chemical that lets a is some hydrogen gas just for the sake of an argument

207
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
That's what he wants and maybe the big one spits out

208
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
The nitrogen which is what the little one wants Olathe

209
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
China come together they smuggle

210
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
Totally ordinary thing happens all the time with c

211
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
But in this case

212
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,839
Stop smuggling gets closer and closer until somehow

213
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Those who sells meat

214
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
And

215
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
They much

216
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
They just squish together how they merge

217
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,711
You know membranes fuse cell walls don't always full maybe the big one it had a hole in its walls

218
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
Fell through hole I don't really know what the mechanism is

219
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
But we do know if

220
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,927
The point is somehow this little guy jumps into the bacterium

221
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Find itself inside the arcade

222
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
That's the first thing I

223
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
Guy gets inside another look

224
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
Like I tell you this is this is this is extremely rare

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,847
Cells don't get inside other cells when they do get inside of the cells for the most part

226
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Doesn't work out

227
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,015
Because if you're this little guy on the inside now you're trapped you can't get the things you want to eat it's cut off

228
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,087
From the outside world and chances are it will die

229
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,183
Which is what happens you know 99.999% of the

230
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Not this time

231
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
If it's a swallower is capable of of bringing in that outside world and feeding it

232
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Food and feeding it to it

233
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
Swallow if you like then then it will work

234
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,151
Maybe that's what happened to your sister maybe the big sale had some kind of mutation that allowed it to keep

235
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Eating the little salad spinner

236
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Eliza Doolittle sell survive

237
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
And thrives

238
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Because the second thing that happens here

239
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Is a little cell in the inside

240
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Struct device

241
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,023
Excel with two cells inside it maybe then. I was inside it

242
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Which if you're a big cell

243
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Normally not a great

244
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Situation you find yourself with

245
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
We guessed inside you imagine having a house party and the gas won't go away

246
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
The cost of producing more guests

247
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,711
I was going to be a ride is going to be a mother or something

248
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,343
The point is his neck when you get to this point it really shouldn't work

249
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
But somehow

250
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
It did

251
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
But not only did one cell get eaten

252
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Will Survive even rear

253
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
And then divided without creating a right even rarer but then somehow this big sale finds ways over and over

254
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Taking care of moles

255
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Do new houseguest

256
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
Amerileather they're all stages of that life cycle you got some old folk in there and you got some babies in that or not how you going

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Going to do it while you probably need to

258
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
I put in the Maternity Ward first of all to look after the baby's let's

259
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:43,903
Yeah that's that's that's putting some kind of clinic for for end-of-life for the for the foot today for the geriatrics

260
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Sauna

261
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,535
This big Sal is able to construct all this new Machinery inside itself

262
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,375
To keep this extraordinarily various group of houseguests

263
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Happy

264
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Why

265
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
Why would it bother I mean like what is the

266
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
What is the cell get in return and youth you said

267
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,431
Said it didn't have enough energy to build itself bigger so how is it even doing this

268
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
Well now you're getting to the real number of the store

269
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,111
The key here says Nick is those little house guests are living now in the Big South

270
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
They're not ordinary house

271
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,023
Very very specific kind of bacteria that we now call mitochondria

272
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,631
And if you look at the descendants of those little guys who live in us right now they have

273
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
An amazingly strong

274
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Electrical charge

275
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Let's order

276
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Radiates

277
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Across the membrane

278
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
On their outside

279
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
An electrical charge

280
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Is

281
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
At least it's the tiny it's a hundred and fifty million

282
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,319
But if you shrink yourself down to

283
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
The size of a molecule

284
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
I'm feel the strength of the electric field right next to. Membrane is it exactly

285
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
230 million volts per meter which is equivalent to a bolt of lightning

286
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,311
This is what the big show gets back cuz it's return gift

287
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,711
Lightning

288
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
And it's this new electricity that gets it

289
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,815
It helps it find all these new adventures in construction project

290
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Now they can

291
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Support

292
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Enormously large adenine so you can have

293
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,287
Bad bacteria may have one or two copies of a gene you cannot have

294
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
20 or 30 maybe 50 there's no penalty for doing 7 what I want that gives you as a kind of a redundancy that allows

295
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,783
Different genes to do slightly different job so to diverge to

296
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,367
No you do call the scope to experiment to try things out

297
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
So you have one group going off to become algae and plants in another group becoming animals in another group becoming the funky and

298
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
The Descendants did

299
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
So well

300
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
They've taken over the world

301
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
And they all came from that

302
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
One single

303
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,335
Coming together and that one you knew yes it comes down to one merger between two cells

304
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
That made one cell

305
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
And then everything comes from

306
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
Yume redwood tree of the hummingbird

307
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Fungus

308
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
He's about to be growing in a pond

309
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
Every type of light that we can see with our Naked Eyes

310
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
And many that we caught

311
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
I'm coming from that single cell

312
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
And what does spawns says Nick is is this is how we get the great tree of life that we see all around us

313
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Hector

314
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Eons and eons of sameness

315
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,199
Send me to get this Many-Splendored Thing That is nature

316
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
It starts right here but we're looking at

317
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
Is truly the Second Genesis

318
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
Play okay hold on a second hold on

319
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
How do we know any of this actually happen

320
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,375
All that that all of the life that we can see comes from one cell how would we possibly know that

321
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Well starting with us

322
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
If you if you go in and look at the genetic material inside ourselves

323
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
About half of all dreams

324
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Little bit less than half

325
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
We find them in bacteria or archaea

326
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,807
Mixes you can see very clearly that the original DNA of those two cells

327
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Two cells are merged into one

328
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
They're inside us

329
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
Stupid ass that sequence in the structure has remained

330
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Kind of almost intact

331
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
The two billion years and just the structure of yourselves alone provides an important clue if you look at the cells of old

332
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
All those things if you look it but take one of your cells

333
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,591
And one cell from that fungus so from the spruce so from the whale

334
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Unless you were

335
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Unless you are next Messi been trained in this

336
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
It would be very hard

337
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
To tell the difference

338
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Between those

339
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
In other words all of ourselves

340
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Lacrosse animal

341
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,903
Plants

342
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Something like those original

343
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Very very similar they will have that nucleus that's internal skeleton they would have mitochondria those are the

344
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Lightning bolt

345
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Descendants of that first of all.

346
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
They got swallowed you know we have

347
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,335
40 trillion cells on each of those has got less a on average mm mitochondria so that they know that

348
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,663
A tremendous number of mitochondria in one human being

349
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
On the giant redwood tree has a lot more than that

350
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
And so does the worm I'm so

351
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
From that point of view just

352
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Biomass we are about 40%

353
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Mitochondria

354
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
So just from biomass

355
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
They are possibly the single most

356
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Prolific

357
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
Life-form that ever existed

358
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Okay you got me

359
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
I do like this

360
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
I mean it is also like

361
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
You know it's a little bit like

362
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
It's a pretty certain we learn who chimed in as we were working on this

363
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Remember our guy what was

364
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
His name from the floppy ears

365
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Kind of witch

366
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Is that Richard Richard

367
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
Consists of

368
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Finding energy

369
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
He had that thing about he wrote a book is all a long time ago but it was all about actually talk to him at the time human and such

370
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
Pictures of going along doing their thing and they're eating

371
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
Draw leaves in the forest same way that chimps do now but then once they learn to cook once you start cooking

372
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Does a terrific advantage

373
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Cooking would break things down and then once

374
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
Then you don't have to break things down inside you which means that you're putting less

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
Energy into your food but getting more out of it. Increases the amount of energy that you can get from your food by 25

376
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
3040 50% maybe more

377
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Mysterious but that

378
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
That is when we got smart

379
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Because we were in again an energy Canyon

380
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Where was just

381
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,423
Given what was around you and how much work it took to break it down to the parts you need you couldn't do much until you light a fire

382
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Fire underneath it

383
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
And and you like a lightning bolt

384
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
And you break it down so that you don't have to do that work cuz now the fires doing that work when you put it in your tummy and you get all the goods

385
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Would have to work

386
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
And now

387
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
Now you have time

388
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
An energy to make a brain

389
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
They can think about

390
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
That is when

391
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
The genus homo

392
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Humans

393
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
In the first

394
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Full flowering

395
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
All the sense of that word

396
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Image

397
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Wow that's a

398
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
To the energy Canyon sleeping

399
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Theory might actually

400
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,775
Touch on mystery number 3 to the conscience one

401
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:29,407
Cooking is an act of intentional I mean it you know when you decide to light the fire and

402
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Put the meat then you're doing something that you and

403
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Intend to do

404
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
To me is when you go back

405
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
To the original

406
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Pairing

407
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Just pure xidan

408
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
I meant so much

409
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Blood flow from something

410
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Incompletely cosmically ask

411
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Occidental

412
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
That's that's

413
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Really really

414
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
That merger and the

415
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Harmonious continuance of that merger

416
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Was so breathtakingly improbable

417
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Only once today

418
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
Nick says it only happened once

419
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
2 billion years

420
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
And there's no evidence to suggest that it is

421
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Happenstance

422
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
So there is no

423
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
Trajectory

424
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Two Worlds

425
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
Necessary complex life or university

426
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,631
Pregnant with the idea reverse there's nothing about the way that he pollution has worked

427
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
On Earth

428
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Just suggested

429
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Complex life is

430
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Uninhabitable out

431
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,871
And if this hadn't happened with the Earth just be still rich with with little

432
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
I don't know life ones that are smaller than the

433
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
The grain of rice that's

434
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
All we'd ever got

435
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,111
I think that's a I did does that mean that you have to have this incident

436
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
On planet xandar

437
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
And Planet zantar 36

438
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,303
That's really interesting right I think when we think about

439
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
Finding the prospect of finding alien life

440
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
If we think

441
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
The universe the universe is so vast

442
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
That we cannot be alone. That must be life on other way

443
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
I think what this

444
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Tells us is that

445
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,455
We will probably find life elsewhere but it will probably be microbes

446
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,015
It was in a did the offensive

447
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
The odds of finding

448
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
Something

449
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:18,464
Like the aliens that you would you expect right so do what they'll do Finding Your Star Wars Cantina

450
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
All significant

451
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
Gilda finding like a bacterium somebody probably

452
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Reasonable

453
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
You might find life but maybe it's going to be

454
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Boring

455
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
We could leave it right there

456
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,456
But you know you probably won't get killed by the Monte Vista.

457
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
That's a good thing that's

458
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

480
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
And I'm here because I need your help

481
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
And I request

482
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

483
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
About what we're calling tiny moments

484
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
Brilliance

485
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Basically I want to hear about this

486
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Times when a kid you know did something

487
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

488
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Maybe it was the moment that I

489
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

490
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Do you

491
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

492
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,952
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

493
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,816
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

494
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't

495
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Have anything to do with the test

496
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
If you have a story

Get here as promised at the top of the show I want to introduce you to a new project that comes from

511
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Two very funny people

512
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
My name is Phoebe Robinson

513
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
And I am

You're okay with that mean literally just put myself in your steak what obviously you're in the wedding

519
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,080
Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson art

520
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,688
2 people who are obsessed with Michael Fassbender I don't even think he's that hot

521
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Now that's so

522
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,832
Commercial and they are both Comedians and writers Phoebe his work for MTV and Comedy Central

523
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,416
Jessica Williams you might know from The Daily Show where she decorrespondent

524
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,000
And two of them 15 dup to make a podcast

525
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Called Stadium today it's called 2 Dope queens and my bet is it if you like Radiolab you will also like the five cat

526
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Where can I buy old wine

527
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
4 second

528
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
There's nothing else for you to be

529
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
SoDo

530
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,408
People still use the word Delta

531
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
All it takes is like to black people to make something

532
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
Yeah that's the rule we came and we walk down the

533
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
Streets around we had our shoes on

534
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
As long as it's two black people doing it

535
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,048
Hello Kris Kross when they did the the genes it was just going to put them there.

536
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
How did you guys meet

537
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
We met

538
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,240
Almost two years ago I was doing a background on a

539
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Black hair in the military peace

540
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
For The Daily Show

541
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
Stories Jessica is doing the segment DB

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
Part of the segment one thing leads to another Vice Jessica to co-host

543
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,016
Comedy think she was doing like a live thing

544
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,112
And she says the moment they got up there on stage murdered

Homicide first-degree murder murder movie

546
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,376
This feels really good

547
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
We should do this more often

548
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
And so we're like always

549
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
You know like I like my

554
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
Just keep seeing how things going to end

555
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,944
The date and then after a while it's it a morph into something that is

Me and Jessica that get up on stage and just kind of Rift

561
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
I think if you're in the audience we really want

562
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
I feel like you're hanging

563
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200

568
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
I wanted to share this thing that my girlfriend and I have been doing

569
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,488
Like this comedian that Phoebe and I both love and him Gary gulman

570

We we role play

571
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,936
Like the other night we're playing Secretary of Housing and Urban Development

572
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
But here's the here's the twist she was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development I was deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development

573
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,480
All the stores that stores that status thing she was my boss and I

00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
I didn't feel she was pushing her agenda hard enough how is he

575
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
Then we come to Washington to make friends

576
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Attempt to make changes

577
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
Then we have people like Michelle buteau and who's really funny and she does stuff a Comedy Central a lot of places

581
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,064
And he came to visit me in New York one time about the cell phones while on the bed and they were exactly alike and it rang and I picked it up

582
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112

583
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392

00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
