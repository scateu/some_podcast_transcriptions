1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Hi this is Jeff High hates me Jeff Roberts started when we bumped into

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
An article in the Philadelphia Inquirer

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,720
We're a little bit weird as to why we are calling you

6
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,584
Yeah I just don't understand the whole thing

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,424
Story really gets going with a phone call to this woman Elizabeth Mason

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
I'm receptionist last switchboard operator to the research lab in Boston and one day she's sitting at her desk

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
And she gets a call

10
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
From a woman who says that she has donated

11
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
Surmise to them and she wants to know what happen

12
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,088
Call you get everyday I just remembered

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
If it's just very unusual right I didn't know what to do with it I just felt like I got to find somebody to help this woman

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,608
Today the story of the of the woman on the other end of that phone call this is her story

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,168
Might save their story so far my title transfer

16
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,544
I'm Sarah gray I'm the mom

17
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,616
Lower

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Really he has on vacation with a girlfriend was it it was it was it what the weather

19
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
What happened

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
That consumers

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
Then we've got different ideas

22
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Different recollection what happened

23
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
We started dating across the

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
Ocean for a year-and-a-half and then

25
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
He moved to America

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
5 days after we arrived they were married a few years after that

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
They are pregnant with twins

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
When did you first know that something was up

29
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
It was at the 12-week

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Screening

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,432
They called the first trimester screening and they're checking for birth defects

32
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
I think the most common one is Down syndrome

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
But it was September 30th 2009 ultrasound tech

34
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Fetuses and shortly after

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
The. Came into the room and

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Said that

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Only one of the twins

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Would make it

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
And one of the twins at anencephaly it would die

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Within a few minutes or hours of being born

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
He said he could see that because one of the twins had a round skull

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
And the other one had a bumpy skull

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
The bumpy skull show them that the skull wasn't

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Correct

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Round enough

46
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
The brain in skull weren't forming properly

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Which is what anencephaly is

48
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Bookshelf

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
I can believe that

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
It's difficult the process of think

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
Copyright I just told this is identical twins but one of them

52
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
Completely different from the other

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
Making matters worse the doctor said that

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
The unhealthy twin was posing a threat to the healthy twin

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
And we were

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
To be safe

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
We would do a selective termination to save the life of the healthy twin

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:03,296
Surterra says they were suddenly faced with this Choice actually talk to two priests on the phone about it

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Really yeah

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Her family is Catholic

61
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Jews raised Catholic

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
I don't know I guess I wanted

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
See what their take was on this

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,048
This is fine. The direction want to go to for this radio story but

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Tell man suddenly interested basically what I was saying is would you come and do a blessing over the selection termination and what they say

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
1 Priest

67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Said

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
No

69
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
Jesus said he wouldn't do a blessing over a selective termination and then the other priest

70
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Said that because of

71
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Thomas Aquinas rule of

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,320
Leichtag is called double account or something basically like the rule that if you

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
If a train is coming

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
And you like

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
You want to save the life

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
Someone on the train tracks and you shoot the driver

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
The right thing to do

78
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:52,192
After looking it up it's actually called the doctrine of double effect and she's

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
Basically right maybe not the part about shooting the driver but the overall idea is that if you're trying to

80
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
To do good

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
And on the way to doing good you must inadvertently do some harm

82
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
It's okay in certain circumstances

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
As long as your intention

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
Anyway the priesthood because you're doing this with the intent of saving

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Healthy twin

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
He would be there and he would do it

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
That's what a few weeks

88
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
We booked the hotel we packed our bags in the night before

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,215
Was really terrible for both of us cuz I don't know we had seen them on the screen and we're bored cat

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
This little

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
Kid next day they go in for the procedure

92
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Going to the

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Room in the doctor

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
What's the sonogram on me and

95
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Start getting ready and he said

96
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,855
Your placenta has moved since the last time you were here

97
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
The location where it is right now

98
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
I don't think we should do this

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
Does he set up if I Nick it if I if I even just make it a little bit

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Like you're going to bleed uncontrollably and kisses

101
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
He said they wouldn't do on his wife

102
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Hela

103
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
What was that like to be on the on the

104
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Table

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,711
Was it really wasn't really an elevator we just hugged her like a

106
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
Any decisions taken at UNC

107
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
It's not our fault

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
But then your healthy twin is more at risk Maybe

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Yes

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Is like a nail-biter for the rest of the six months

111
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
According to Rostow's six months were

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Deeply strange just buying one of everything when you know those two babies coming

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
When you were going to be having a funeral as well so

114
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
You know I called the

115
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
What you called if you know that right though

116
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
And told them you know we're going to be having a funeral

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Play Lil Wayne

118
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Was that

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
Megan Barnett

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Alright so they get to the day of

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
March

122
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
Weather 23rd okay 2010

123
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Thomas came out first

124
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Is the sick one that had an affair

125
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
And then a minute later Calum came out

126
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,351
I know it wasn't sure if Thomas was going to be born alive I sort of expected him to

127
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Die within a few minutes

128
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
He was he was struggling that thoughts

129
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Didn't think is going to last too long but then he Cana

130
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Urology

131
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Pretty good

132
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,711
Ali it was in Calum the healthy twin who started to have some trouble at the beginning and so

133
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,319
He and Sarah went off to the infant ICU and cirrhosis in the delivery room

134
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
That's just me and honest though

135
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Quite well I C words

136
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Come together

137
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
What was that like

138
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
It was

139
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
EIC was cute

140
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Play Brandy Baby

141
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Macride

142
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
He's like grabbing onto my finger

143
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
I don't think the kind of things that babies do you know

144
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
There's nothing you can do but

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Toscana

146
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
You know I'm trying to

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
How do you spell from crying and cheering

148
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
In I remember coming to the

149
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
Recovery really Rasta this little bundle in his arms and I said

150
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Who's that

151
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
And he said Thomas Edison

152
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
That he's alive

153
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
And I'm like oh let me hold him until I held him in

154
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Yeah it was

155
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Cute like he breastfed and we can

156
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Feeding with a bottle

157
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
Dan of taking him out I didn't really planned on that like we didn't have another car seat

158
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
We just didn't

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,543
Think about it and I remember thinking like what if he's going to beat the odds like

160
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
Do we need to arrange daycare and like

161
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
You know we hadn't thought of that

162
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Then soon after Thomas started having seizures

163
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Start having trouble breathing

164
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,903
Stopped eating and at the time I remember thinking

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
You know it come on little guilin

166
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Eat some more like

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
Eat some more than you'll be stronger

168
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
I was I just eat

169
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
What's up

170
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
How how

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
How long did Thomas live

172
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
6 days

173
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Texas

174
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
He died in his arms newest Runaway

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
All of the people that loved him

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
And then right then

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
We called

178
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,831
Washington Regional transplant Community they sent a van over to our house

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
He picked up his body and took him to

180
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,743
DC Children's National Medical Center

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
Okay so this is where the story really gets going I guess so how did that idea of donating is working

182
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
Hey, do your head in the paper newspaper article or something there's

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
About a baby who would anencephaly who donated liver cells

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
And

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
Most major religions support organ donation

186
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,207
What happened next

187
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
I think some letters

188
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,911
Is there a form letter it basically said thank you for your generous donation Thomas's Cornelius it with incentives

189
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
This place in Boston where they study

190
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Potential cure for blindness

191
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
Had his liver 7/10 this place in Durham North Carolina where they study ways to treat

192
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Liver disease

193
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Cuz I thought I want to know

194
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
Who ordered it which researcher got it and what study are they working on

195
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
Because I had this new baby Calum to raise

196
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
I put it behind the both of us

197
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
But then

198
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Sarah says they got to the one-year anniversary

199
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,887
The one-year anniversary felt like a big moment to me like that's when

200
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
I can

201
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
That's when it stopped being in the present and it can start being in the past

202
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
You know just explaining it to people least I can say it was a year ago so they don't have to feel

203
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Stressed out when they talk

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,711
Talk to me and it felt like a big deal like I think we were going to go to the cemetery and put some flowers on his

205
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Craven

206
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
I wanted to

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Tell my family

208
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
What were the results

209
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
What is donation

210
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
So she called the donor Family Services person at the place

211
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,559
I picked up Thomas's body and she basically asked them any more information you can give us

212
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
About the specific study or the researcher

213
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
It was published and they didn't have any

214
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
So I just thought okay well I tried you know

215
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
But you couldn't quite let it

216
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Go mean what you mean she couldn't quite Let It Go

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Curiosity

218
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
But I also think she was having

219
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
On some level like a big conversation with universe

220
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
I like this terrible thing happened

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,743
How do you explain it to yourself

222
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
In God

223
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
And how the universe works I thought that

224
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,447
Karma work or if I was basically a good person and I've obeyed the rules good things with

225
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
And whatever the reason these thoughts about Thomas and where he ended up

226
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
You just there

227
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,431
She had no real Opportunity Act on it so they're just going to come in and out of her mind

228
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
Then around the two year anniversary

229
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,319
Just now a year later I had a business trip to Boston

230
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Nose exhibiting at a conference

231
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Hynes Convention Center

232
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,303
And I Googled it and I saw that Skype inside Research Institute was just a few miles away that's where Thomas is Cornelius at

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Lunch break

234
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,215
That's exactly what I did I called Sky pins

235
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,055
And I said you know I donated my son's eyes to this lab

236
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
A couple years ago and I'm here in town

237
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
Is there any chance I can come by for a tour for like 10 minutes

238
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Then with the weird been a weird phone call

239
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Yes I mean yes

240
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
Yeah that would like a wake her up that's Elizabeth Mason again it was just very unusual surprise

241
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
I didn't know what to do with it before never have gotten there for 25 years

242
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
She said hold on let me

243
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
Connect you to the right person don't hang up a lot of times they say something they hang up on me so I said please help line

244
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,407
I started searching for someone to speak with her to figure out who that is but don't hang up

245
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,735
And they connected me with someone in donor relations but it was

246
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Financial donor relations

247
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
I would like

248
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,695
Like the different not known organ donor

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
But because they don't have any other donor relation that what you know like that was the person that gives the tours and deals with the public

250
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
So

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
That she got to talk to me and she was serious as the one was

252
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
A little bit flustered but super nice and said

253
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
We know it never done this before but yeah come on down will

254
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Give you a tour

255
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
So excited I took pictures of the outside of the building

256
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
And I felt I stood in the lobby and I

257
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,551
Put one of the brochures in my purse

258
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
And I just felt like I

259
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
I can't believe I'm here this is like being in Santa's Workshop or something like

260
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
I didn't think this was a place you could ask

261
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
She's taking around

262
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Eventually she got taken to the lab where Thomas is corneas when

263
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
And there were refrigerators with signs that said no food

264
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
And then she introduced me to this guy called dr. James ziskie

265
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
Who's the professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Med School

266
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
He was eating his lunch at his desk

267
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Can she explain who I was

268
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
And you said

269
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
You thank you for the donation and do you have any questions for me

270
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Of course she did

271
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
I wanted to know how valuable the eyes were like if they get thousands and thousands or take it one or two or like when the

272
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Delivery came with everyone excited or was it

273
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
No big deal

274
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
What was the sitting on a shelf collecting dust over people doing stuff with it

275
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:02,335
He put down his lunch and he said most of the eyes that we got her from people who are older just cuz

276
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Most people are older when they die

277
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
An infant's eyes are worth their weight in gold

278
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
I was like that could barely speak

279
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Could you tell me why

280
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
He said because they regenerate that

281
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
Regenerative properties

282
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,047
And he said if you don't mind me asking how long ago did your son die and I said about 2 years ago

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
And he said well we're likely still using your son's

284
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Sales right now

285
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Is that the one you love

286
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
I know

287
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
To that point there was like okay

288
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
Since that worked out so well why not just go keep going with it and visit

289
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
All of the

290
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
Places where bits and pieces of Thomas ended up

291
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
So you know

292
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,463
Chase down his liver his retina is Cord Blood how many doctors might that be

293
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
Well there's the Boston won their two in North Carolina she would ultimately discover one in Richmond Virginia

294
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Affiliate

295
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
She turns out that these people

296
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Didn't

297
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Find anything

298
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
You know research is research you don't always

299
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Have a hit

300
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
It's true she's not heading for validation necessarily here she might find it

301
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
Make it further lost

302
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
Yeah but she's going to go

303
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
She's going to go

304
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
She's not going to stop

305
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Hi this is Shireen from Sunrise Florida

00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,063
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

310
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
And I'm here because I need your help

311
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
And I request

312
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

313
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

314
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
So did something

315
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

316
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

317
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

318
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

319
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

320
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
If you have a story please share it with us

321
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

322
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
Record short audio message for us

323
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
And that's radiolab.org / brilliance

324
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Thank you so much

325
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,983
Hey I'm Jared I'm rod iron Robert krulwich this is Radio are we okay yes oh Sarah gray when we left Earth

326
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,311
Two standing in a research office in Boston and feeling good

327
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,711
She got this Rose of a success until after that her and Rasika in the car and head down south to Durham North Carolina

328
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:26,111
Thomas's liver and a bit of his Blood for Blood because it turns out that in the delivery room

329
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,999
Right after birth Twins were born nurses had withdrawn a little bit of cord blood from both twins sent it off to Duke

330
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,095
Where researchers were studying the disease that killed Thomas anencephaly

331
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
She said they walked in

332
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
Study coordinator this guy who worked on the Human Genome Project

333
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
A grad student

334
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,127
They made all these different researchers who all seemed really excited about her twins blood sample

335
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
I think it was just weird that one of them had anencephaly one of them didn't and they were genetically identical

336
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
Play for them to compare

337
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,439
Kappa Delta one of the researchers even told them that they had compared

338
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Thomas's blood to Callum

339
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
And

340
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,863
They found there were a thousand differences in epigenetics between both twins

341
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,495
They're called epigenetic Differences I think their genes are the same but the things that control the genes word

342
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
They began identical but then somehow in utero

343
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Little changes

344
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Set up between them

345
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Yes

346
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Fossil in a few this changes might one day explain the disease

347
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
In fact I even asked the grad student who work on it most closely

348
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,951
Deirdre crop as a were you surprised by what you saw and she said

349
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
For me to be surprised

350
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
That implies that I knew what to expect

351
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
So we're just at the beginning of this trying to learn about

352
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
So that's two roses like this is that is amazing yep is it to sort of

353
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
He's on a roll here

354
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,663
So after visit to they got in the car drove down the street to this place called Saito net

355
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Is there a town with liver ended up

356
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
Basic recital net will take a solid liver

357
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
And they liquefy it

358
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
And then they inject the liquid liver into a baby

359
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
It's waiting on a liver transplant

360
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Plant as a bridge therapy

361
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Liquid liver

362
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Yeah they went in again refrigerators Petri dishes

363
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Issue with Thomas

364
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
His liver was bruised

365
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
When they got it

366
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
So they couldn't injected into a baby then they told her that they were able to use it in an experiment

367
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,967
To determine what was the best temperature to freeze infant liver cells

368
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,527
Which is -150 degrees C

369
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
As you already know

370
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
Okay have a rose and she says it one point as they were being walked around the place

371
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
We watch to the break room

372
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
And someone had taken a picture

373
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Of Thomas that we had handed out

374
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
And they took the photograph and they taped it up in the break room

375
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,823
With a little sign that they wrote on it saying Thomas Gray was a donor here March 29th 2010

376
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,175
And it was so excited to see that cuz I thought they're just as curious about us

377
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
As we are about them

378
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,807
Like I was wondering who what kind of person goes to work and opens up a box with liver in it

379
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:09,183
You're probably wondering what kind of person takes their loved ones liver and put them in a box and mail it over here

380
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
So my name is Rupa Ganguli

381
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm a professor in the department of genetics

382
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
At University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine

383
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
Nella Rupa Ganguly just switched her for a second she said he's a kind of cancer of the eye called retinal blast

384
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,407
Stoma which happens almost exclusively in children at this point

385
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
She doesn't know Sarah she has no concept of

386
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
What's happening

387
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
She is just studying eyes

388
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Philly Philly Philadelphia

389
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
Nature studies tumors but she also needs healthy retinas in order to do her work now you can imagine that getting an arm

390
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Retina

391
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Is

392
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Not a very

393
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Easy task

394
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Because why would you get it on

395
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
From a baby

396
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
I must have knew that if

397
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
And when an eyeball comes

398
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
It is not

399
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
A pleasant experience

400
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Right because

401
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
For a moment you have to think

402
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
The origin of the sources

403
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Stop this

404
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Eyeball

405
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
It's

406
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Sad

407
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
And every possible

408
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Setting

409
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
It's sad

410
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Sad and frustrating

411
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,815
Only when a normal child dies

412
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
That's what I can get this

413
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
Set a horrible setup

414
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
In my mind

415
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
She says often when the retina is arrived which is

416
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,919
After me once a year and you pull them out of their packaging you right away at you feel like

417
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
Maybe you're trading on other people's misery

418
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
And I mean it's so bad

419
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
When a child dies

420
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
But I am

421
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Asking for his

422
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Are her

423
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Retina

424
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
Either way I had the sense of guilt

425
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
In my head

426
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Never but never spoken to

427
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Apparent

428
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Any of her stamp

429
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
So when she got that email

430
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,127
Did you sitting your computer and she read the email from the company that provided of the sample saying the mother of this sample

431
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Wants to get in contact with

432
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
I paused I stopped

433
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
And

434
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
Doing what I was doing and I thought

435
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Why does the mother want

436
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Talk to me

437
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
That was my first

438
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Question

439
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
So

440
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,936
I did not reply right away

441
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,008
But after my conversation with the lab I

442
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Took I think one day

443
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
To compose a letter

444
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
And I sent it back

445
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Do Saturday

446
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,992
And they ended up eventually talking on the phone I told her I think

447
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,088
At the very onset that sorry you have to understand

448
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
And that

449
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
I feel awful

450
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
You said she felt kind of guilty because she wished for the stamp

451
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Like almost by wishing for it

452
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
She made it happen

453
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
She said Aruba you should not feel bad about it

454
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,472
If you didn't use my son's retina I would have buried in the ground

455
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
You're the

456
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Only one that wanted

457
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Bad things happen to children

458
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
And so by being able

459
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
To help you

460
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
With your work

461
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
We added a layer

462
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
To Thomas's life

463
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
That was

464
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
I was amazed

465
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
Eventually Sarah and Ross visita de roupas lab

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
She gave them a tour

467
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
She sold them thomases right now

468
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
He still has

469
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Samples of it in her

470
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Freezer

471
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Tiny little

472
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,080
I don't know tiny little vials maybe a third the size of your pinky filled with frozen liquid liquefied

473
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,432
Right now it didn't look like much but it was amazing to think of how many

474
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
People were involved

475
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Getting the samples they're like

476
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Like we had to

477
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,904
Approval we had to fill out this paperwork done the doctor had to come and remove the eyes and eyes had to be pressed

478
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
If not I have to be

479
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
Shipped up there that they have to

480
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
Do whatever DNA process they do and just

481
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
Valuable

482
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Maybe even priceless

483
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
The simplest

484
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
Services that throughout the whole process

485
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Nails losing

486
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
A child

487
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,128
And then seeing him reclaimed bit by bit by all of these differ

488
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
People

489
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Something chic

490
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Shifted in me

491
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Like the universe

492
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Treated people the way it should

493
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
And now I don't really believe that

494
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
But I'm

495
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
I do believe that

496
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
There are

497
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Really amazing

498
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Kind people

499
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
In the world

500
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
And

501
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
Science and medicine has something to do in life

502
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
I started feeling that

503
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,200
He's worked on his colleagues and his co-workers and that he was a valuable partner

504
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
In the important research that was being done

505
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
Can I feel 10 even more fundamental shift

506
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,416
Almost like I had felt like I was a boat on an ocean that was like

507
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
Rocky and choppy with waves

508
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,560
And I've had this feeling that I am not the boat on the ocean

509
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Like

510
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,192
The decisions I make are changing other people

511
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,288
I'm supposed to just I'm about getting slapped with Waze all the time

512
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,272
It just made me feel powerful

513
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,824
Like to thank the Philadelphia Inquirer for getting us going on this

514
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
Michael Vick says for his reporting it's Damiano marchetti Productions portal

515
