1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:10,752
Northland listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,664
Radiolab from WNYC

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,968
NPR

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,808
Ladies Vagina please welcome to the stage

5
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
Young Jedi been wrought iron Robert rovics Radiolab band a while back we were on stage

6
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
We're alive

7
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
At the Paramount Theater in downtown Seattle with several years ago he called that show apocalyptical cuz it was about

8
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,392
Ending different kinds of endings of different things

9
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,208
All of these incredible musicians and video artists

10
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
Then we had a huge yes

11
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Paw Patrol all of which you can see on the video on my website at radiolab.org but we're going to do for you now

12
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
Is play you part of that original show

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Actually the first

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
Story in that show which is about the end

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Of the dinosaur

16
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
Because we have news to tell you about that story and it's a verisimilitude

17
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
So we're going to go first play you part one of our show about dinosaurs

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Let's go back to the

19
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Paramount Theater NC

20
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Started off for us

21
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
You're at Purdue University and I study impact craters among other things

22
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Create impact craters with his mind but he and his colleagues have been investigating this moment

23
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Almost as if it were a crime scene that happened not 60 million years ago but yesterday

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
In the story that they put together it's more than just interesting it's frankly

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
Twinkly terrifying

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Specific

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Take for example

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
The seemingly simple question of when when did it happen if you don't mean like the year

29
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
That would be a little too specific

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
No I don't know if you remember but Jay got even more specific

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Chicken at

32
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
This is a casual question that I threw up

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Listen to his

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
By the way do we know anything about seasons was it so warm

35
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Actually it was between well this is a bit of a stretch but it was sometime between June and July

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
You so specifically how would you know that

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
The reasoning is week we can for example this is the this is the first surprise kind of controversial ideas

38
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
The basic ghost

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Json

40
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Scientists have found some Paulo

41
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
In rocks which date from that

42
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Two different kinds of pain

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
And based on an analysis of those two kinds of pollen

44
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
We know that the impact took place between the flowering of the lotus in the flowering of the waterline

45
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,064
Lotus you see flowering on the left

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
The water lily flowering on the right you can see this if you look at our video online

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,536
Fossils found at the impact site that had pollen from both of these flowers in the same Rock

48
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Would suggest

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
The impact did in fact take place

50
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Somewhere between June and July

51
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
It's one of those things in Geometry tweet

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,848
We got a glimpse of a moment far far back in time

53
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
2

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Let's go deeper into that Moana

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Let's collectively ruined our minds back in time 10 million

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
As of years into the past 66 million years ago to be precise

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
There they are Majestic beasts hanging out on the plains

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
Eating their Lotus leaves sometime in

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
June June 17th let's say

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Everything on this day pretty much normal this particular

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
People day was no different than any of

62
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
Millions and millions of previous days as far as the dinosaurs were concerned but if there were any astronomer

63
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,055
Set the time with their work they might have had some inkling that something was coming because

64
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
Had they looked up we would have seen a Time Little Dot of light in the sky

65
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Where is planets the Moon

66
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,111
Move with respect to the Stars this would have had a constant bearing

67
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
An old Seaman could tell you that

68
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,767
But if you see something constant bearing that's on a collision course with you

69
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Nothing of course

70
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Is Arash

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
Zeroing in on the Earth

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
I want to say that we do know quite a bit about

73
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
This asteroid

74
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
From the size of the creator

75
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,127
And from the amount of certain minerals found at the impact site we know that the asteroid was roughly

76
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
6 miles wide

77
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
And then again roughly 6 miles long which makes it approximately the size of Manhattan Island

78
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Mount Everest is roughly the size of Mount Everest

79
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
That is the Robertson a geologist who knows quite a bit about this asteroid

80
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
And by the way it has a name

81
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
It's the asteroid called Baptists Tina

82
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Baptist email

83
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Why xtina

84
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Baptist in Idaho

85
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
The name Astrid

86
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
On another subject

87
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,919
We do know that the Earth's moon was probably produced by a collision with something the size of Mars

88
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Well

89
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
I just did that Inc

90
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
School doesn't really relate to our story

91
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
The whole evening he was just a do it okay the dinosaurs are here on Earth are eating their leaves meanwhile up in space are asked

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
Asteroid Baptist peanut is now hurtling towards the Earth 20000 miles an hour

93
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
Times faster than a very fast rifle bullet couldn't be sure what would happen that matter

94
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,383
Mount Everest size bullet traveling at 20000 miles an hour our atmosphere

95
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,247
The atmosphere is really just a very very thin skin over the rest of the yard sale

96
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
Scientists construct the story

97
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Just take a piece by piece and 1st

98
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Figure out

99
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
What would happen

100
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
And when this big ball

101
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Hurtling through space

102
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Slams into our atmosphere

103
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Just made of gas

104
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Of course

105
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
So just aproximate let's fire a bullet through some gas

106
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
And Watch What Happens live show de super slow motion

107
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
Video of a gun firing a bullet underwater

108
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
Can see it on the website radiolab.org very beautiful

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
See the ball coming out and freeze it right there at the edge okay

110
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
Basically Seasons bullet steaming through the water

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,903
By the way we use water as an approximation for gas cuz and gas you would have the same effect I'm about to just

112
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Creating a wake

113
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Behind it in the wake

114
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
It's wider and wider as a

115
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
Trails away from the bullets and if you imagine this shape in 3 dimensions

116
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Really what you're looking at is a kind of a cone like a funnel shape

117
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Inside the the

118
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
The waltz of the funnel

119
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Inside that cone

120
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Is nothing

121
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Nothing

122
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Nothing because it water so you saying there's a hole in the water that's what I'm saying

123
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
There's a vacuum in there

124
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
Because the bullet is shooting through the water pushes the water out of the way

125
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,255
And for a beat the water doesn't have time to come back together and so all you have is emptiness

126
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Right there this what you're seeing is a massive hole in the water

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Created by

128
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Now imagine that bullet

129
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Is 6 miles wide

130
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
And the whole it is making is right above your head

131
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
What is that mean if your dinosaur look you up with what would happen

132
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Well if you were in the right

133
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,783
Play sand in this is going to be the wrong place in a second or two were in the right place

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Tutu look behind the

135
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Asteroid is it came in

136
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
You'd probably be able to to

137
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
To see clearly through the space

138
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,863
What

139
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Does that mean you would suddenly

140
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Be looking at a

141
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Nighttime hole in the daytime sky

142
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Right

143
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
Jay did tell us that you would need special kinds of eyeballs to see this Nighthawk

144
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Today's sky and the Dinos didn't have

145
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Science

146
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Still

147
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Just imagine what a last image

148
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
What do you see

149
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Day and night

150
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Come together in the same moment

151
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
But

152
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Coordinate

153
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Better not blink

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
Because before you could open your eyes again

155
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
The asteroid would have hit the surface

156
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,919
And if you're in a position to to see that then you're going to be in golf

157
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Bike

158
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
The violence that is just about to

159
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
By the way the audience was just laughing at a dinos de los Muertos graphics

160
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
It just came on the screen

161
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
So we know it was a big explosion fine

162
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Oedipus violent fine

163
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
I think we should be a little bit subtle about this because obviously if an asteroid is the size of Manhattan and it lands on your head your

164
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
You're not going to feel very good about that

165
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
But if

166
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Manhattan is

167
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Is hitting a

168
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Planet Earth

169
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,383
That's a little bit like a pebble hitting an enormous beach ball and I can imagine that the little Pebbles

170
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
AltaVista

171
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Peking pebblewood

172
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Kratom damage

173
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,831
In the spot where it landed but let's suppose that you are

174
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
Alleviating mother-of-three hadrosaur living in New Zealand

175
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,839
Just at the moment of the asteroid comes in your on your auntie pogany other side of the planet

176
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Would you like any idea this way

177
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Let's the next question that we talked to Jay

178
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
How much damage would this thing a

179
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
Actually do

180
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
We can produce things

181
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
Situations like this in small quantities in the laboratory which brings us

182
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
Peter Schultz

183
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
I like to do impact experiments as every 13 year old

184
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,263
Dream job to get the blow s*** up for a living

185
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Screen this is the NASA Ames laboratory in California and the thing that they're putting together their middle frame

186
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
That is a giant

187
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
3 story tall Cannon

188
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,111
What Pete has he takes projectile so for example you're going to see him

189
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Take a little glass bullet over there and it's going to load it into the top of the cannon and then he's going to fire it right

190
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,863
Into a stand up for planet Earth which for him will be a sandpit

191
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
I'm looking for us when we call Pete he was just about to pull the trigger on this thing we're calling you on a date

192
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
What you are trying to Rick's re-experience vide actually survive

193
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
Opposition

194
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Cross your fingers

195
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
Battles in here we go

196
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
That is gorgeous

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,295
Gosh is that good get instant playback

198
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
That

199
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
Is the sound of a man

200
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Very happy

201
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
With his explosion

202
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
You can see

203
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Piece of this what's happening so based on experiments like this people like pecan figure out precisely what happened

204
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
When the asteroid hit the Earth

205
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,567
They can quantify the explosions Power by basically leveraging up experiments like this so according to Doug the amount of energy

206
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
That would have been on weeks when nothing came rushing in on Earth

207
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Roughly

208
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Are we at the Earth

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:11,135
With an explosion that 100 million megatons

210
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Sarah lipstate

211
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Sarah our guitarist going to

212
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Turn around had a metal moment

213
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
Don't look at her wrong and she'll do that to you

214
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Okay so here's essentially how Doug broke that down

215
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
2 tons of TNT

216
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
We talk in tongues you're not megatons to tons of TNT

217
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Will essentially do

218
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,391
This

219
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
On one of the three screens you see a 10-story building in floating

220
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
2 tons of TNT will takedown build

221
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Now

222
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,679
15000 tons of TNT that is what the United States dropped on Hiroshima

223
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
In 1945 on a second screen we see archival footage of the atomic bomb

224
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
That chaos has 15000 tons of TNT Robertson a hydrogen bomb

225
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
Current hydrogen bombs are typically of the order of one million tons of TNT

226
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
Equivalent Now 1 million tons of TNT equivalent that's what we call a Megaton if you remember

227
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
Duck said that the asteroid impact was equivalent to 100 million

228
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
In megatons really what he saying in concrete terms is that that impact was the equivalent of 100 million of those

229
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
Bombs going off all at once in the same spot

230
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Which is a lot

231
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Dentistry

232
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,391
However I mean it's really depends on what you mean by a lot

233
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
Because I was doing a little Googling

234
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
And I was surprised to learn that

235
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,095
110 million megatons is not nearly enough to destroy the planet

236
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Destroy the entire planet

237
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
You would need

238
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Ready for this

239
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,495
110 quadrillion megatons

240
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
100 million * 110 million megatons of TNT

241
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
So going back to your hadrosaur situation Mother 3

242
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
New Zealand

243
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
If the thing came in Antipolo to her

244
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Maybe she would feel the ground shake a little bit

245
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
But after minutes should be like whatever

246
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
To go back to eating leaves

247
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Probably wouldn't notice it

248
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,231
Oh no no no that's not what we were taught in homeroom

249
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
Buy Mrs lagrou or whoever your teacher what

250
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Here's the classic explanation

251
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
There was an impact

252
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,447
Of course and kicked up an enormous amount of dust to remember this

253
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
The Dustin kind of covers the planet

254
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Blankets the earth makes the Earth very cold

255
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Makes tears very nasty

256
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,431
All the big plants die little plants get sick the dinosaurs get hungry the dinosaurs get sick

257
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
And then gradually your leg

258
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Dad

259
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Better and better and better from different thing

260
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,623
10000 years 30 thousand years for till you get like a

261
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
900000 years later

262
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Shivering the last

263
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Dinosaur

264
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
That's the story we were told

265
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
In school is a long slow wintry collapse

266
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
That tired old story from Missy

267
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,919
Is what it is Magruder's McGruder tonight okay

268
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
What is offer up a completely different tablets

269
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
All right

270
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,183
But we'll go with that what's actually flipped the understanding completely new science

271
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Keith

272
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
Pull up that to ballistics video that we showed earlier with the red sand

273
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Can you put a pull that up and blow it up to the

274
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Three screens in the

275
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Yeah rewind it back

276
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Bitten

277
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Wilkie

278
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
Okay so this is a 6000 frame a second video that you're sitting here

279
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Sir Pizza lab

280
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
This point on the screen all you're saying is

281
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Pit of red sand

282
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Now what you see in the first few frames as you see the laser hitting right there red sand flying in the air super slo-mo

283
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
The next

284
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,303
Rainford right there you see some fire see little ball of fire erupts near the impact

285
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
Right where the laser hits the sand there's a little

286
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Clump of flame in

287
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Refreeze on that spot

288
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
Scientists can now measure the temperatures in that spot

289
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Just to State the obvious

290
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
We know from those measurements

291
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
But that spot right there would have gotten

292
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Very

293
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Very

294
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Very

295
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Very

296
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Barry

297
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Hot TV on the temperature of the sun we were talking

298
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
Cooking temperatures maybe 20,000 degrees Sons temperatures about 5,000 degrees

299
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
And if we're talking temperatures hotter than the sun

300
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
Instantly turn to gas a very

301
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
Savory high-temperature high-pressure gas it's actually Rock Vapor rocks team

302
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
This thing comes barreling in this asteroid it doesn't Just Bounce Off the Earth if plows into the earth goes into the surface

303
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
2 miles in 5 miles in 7 miles in 10 mi in 20 miles into the Earth it goes

304
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,103
Close all the rock that is turning into a liquid and then into a gas and now

305
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,687
Watch What Happens Next is a basic physics experiment we're going to show you

306
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
On the screen you see

307
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
Is very lovely video actually of a

308
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Hand

309
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Dropping a metal ball

310
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Into something

311
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Just a dude dropping a bomb from Sand

312
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Watch this right here

313
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Magazin

314
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
And like a millisecond

315
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
Effort makes impact disappears into the sand

316
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,191
A little spear of sand go shooting back in the opposite direction

317
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Triple bounce back

318
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,079
Does this always happen this whatever this is Newton's law of something

319
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Newton's Laws

320
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
And what you see is you see this fine Lewis and you're shooting back in the office

321
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
What's the directions

322
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
Right now imagine

323
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Did that ball is

324
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
An asteroid

325
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
And that's and over there that's the planet

326
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
To keep play that one more time

327
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Play the video again but this time as the ball drops

328
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
It gradually morphs

329
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
Thank you for the sad so what you would get the same effect

330
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
You would get that

331
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
Simple boy that's just something we do

332
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,207
You wondering where we get all of our soundesign out of that man's mouth that's where

333
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
So you get that same bounce-back effect

334
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
A fine blue shooting back in the opposite direction but we know

335
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Or we just heard

336
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
Describe that it would not be would not be staying in this case

337
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
It would be Rock

338
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Gas

339
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Tumble podcast

340
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,383
Six bends upward and pushes right on through the atmosphere

341
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Up into space

342
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Some fractions

343
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
At the Moon

344
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
Read some fraction of that hit Mars

345
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,367
Okay so now you got this sneeze of rock Vapor it's out in space

346
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Basic physics says that as a travels out of

347
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Farther away from the Earth

348
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
What's going to happen if it's going to start to cool down a bit

349
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
When it cools itri condenses into little droplets

350
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Well that.

351
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
Basically Farm glass very quickly

352
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Little droplets of glass about the size of sand

353
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
Now if you look at one of these little droplets of glass

354
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Under microscope

355
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
This is what it looks like

356
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Right there

357
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
On the screen you see what looks kind of like a translucent snowball that is actually of a magnified image of one of these

358
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
It's a classic fell from space

359
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
That day

360
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Most of them didn't land on the ground

361
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Talk about that in a second there it is

362
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
I know about you but I find that

363
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Totally terrifying

364
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Cuz that's

365
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
It's like a little backed

366
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Christina Wright

367
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Honeyville asteroid

368
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Now imagine trillions of these things

369
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
In a cloud

370
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
McLeod of shrapnel going out out out

371
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Away from the Earth

372
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
What's going to happen next is that

373
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
It's going to start to lose momentum that cloud

374
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
When does the Earth's gravity

375
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
He's going to grab back hold of it and say come on back

376
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
And 90% of them come back

377
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
The Earth

378
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
What does falling glass do

379
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Because what happens is it the the

380
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Glass out in space

381
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,375
Starts to spread out like north and south and east and west

382
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,727
And eventually it will appear in the sky over New Zealand

383
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,335
It's now a global phenomena and you know it's really hard to imagine what the hadrosaur would have seen

384
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
But the thing to keep in mind

385
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Is it these things are coming in

386
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
97% or burning up in the atmosphere

387
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
So very few of them were hiding the gray

388
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
From her point of view

389
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
Probably would have looked

390
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Greatest meteor shower

391
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Anyone has ever seen

392
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
With one

393
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Significant

394
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Bummer

395
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Which is this

396
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
When is the little bits of glass come in each one that burns up

397
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Depositing

398
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
A little bit of heat into the sky

399
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,127
Collectively there's such a massive rain of these things coming in

400
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Well

401
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
The heat would build up the sky would turn red

402
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
It would be getting hotter and hotter

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
Hot exactly would have gotten the cow much heat exactly would have built up there in the sky and then

404
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
And started to radiate down calculated the amount of heat that would come

405
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
10 kilowatts per square meter and get this number well what what does that

406
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Well I went home and Ike current meter and

407
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Tried to measure the amount of heat produced in my oven for different amounts of power and I could get

408
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
About 7 kilowatts per square meter in my oven on broil and

409
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
500 Degrees broil

410
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
Measuring other kinds of ovens

411
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Pizza Oven a pizza oven is about right which means that if you were a terrestrial dinosaur any

412
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
We're above the ground on the earth on that day you would have experienced some heat it is almost

413
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,424
Unimaginable maybe it started it a hundred degrees cuz it was June was summer

414
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
But within minutes it would have been 300 degrees 500 Degrees

415
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,224
700 degrees 900 Degrees

416
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,624
Estimate or on that day temperatures topped out of something like 1200

417
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Degrees at that temperature nothing can protect you your scales your fur

418
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,424
Whatever you got going to do any good if your blood will literally starts a boil inside your

419
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,288
Your body and you will die

420
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
To essentially

421
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,640
According to this Theory the dinosaurs and everything else on Earth that day would have been incinerated

422
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Don't think that's what the demand not so much

423
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
The impact

424
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
All that objective

425
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
Went up into the sky came down as glass rain and created that he

426
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
That's what did the men

427
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,720
He would argue it didn't just do some of the men

428
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Or even many of

429
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
When he would say it did

430
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
All of them in

431
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
All at once

432
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
There is

433
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
Zero evidence that any dinosaur made

434
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
The crazy part of

435
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
The series that Jay and Doug think the whole process

436
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
From the impact of the glass rain to the incineration of

437
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
All of these species on the planet

438
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
It would have taken a few hours

439
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
His best guess

440
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
He thinks Maybe

441
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
2

442
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Hours

443
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
I mean that's less time than

444
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
A business lunch

445
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
You tried getting East

446
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,680
Northwest anywhere on Mercer Street at rush hour into

447
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Miss you think about it

448
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,080
That is less time than you will spend

449
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
In this theater

450
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Tonight

451
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,712
That means that you're saying that

452
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
An animal

453
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
That had been Supreme on the planet

454
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,624
100 million years

455
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Disappears

456
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
In

457
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Few hours

458
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Completely

459
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Yes

460
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
That's what

461
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
The evidence suggests

462
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
That's right

463
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,640
Well you can consider the evidence but also you can consider common sense and we've got

464
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
A world

465
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,272
Bills with terrestrial dinosaurs they were on every continent there even in Antarctica

466
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
And just say that they all disappeared

467
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
In 2 hours and

468
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
All that wood that suggests

469
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,072
But there's none of them in out of Harm's Way none of them in the cave summer

470
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
None of them in the grotto

471
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,400
None of them in a in a

472
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,496
Acted Paris that any climate the word all not connection

473
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
It's just too much

474
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
I just don't buy it

475
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
The truth is that the science is never going to be

476
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
So exact

477
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
To say

478
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Yeah all of them disappeared

479
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
It happened on a

480
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Single day

481
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Renewing mean

482
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
Note that we have is

483
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
What json is

484
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Happen fast

485
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Very fast

486
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Nothing made it through

487
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
What I find interesting is It ultimately

488
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
You don't need the ballistics

489
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,728
Anything we've shown you so far to know that something major and sudden

490
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
Because you can see evidence

491
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Of it literally etched into the Earth

492
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
So

493
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Here's the spot

494
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Where we first found

495
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
You can see really well out in Colorado

496
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,392
Actually we sent one of our producers Molly Webster out there to meet of paleontology

497
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Kirk Johnson

498
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
They hiked over a couple of hills

499
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,608
Stikbot dinosaur come around the corner and

500
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
He started to dig

501
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Download

502
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
From where we were

503
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Turns out

504
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
33 ft down 10,000 years in time

505
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
See the Earth has layers

506
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Pelican tree has ring

507
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
And every 3 ft down you go you're going back in

508
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Time about ten thousand years

509
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,976
When you go all the way down all the way back

510
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
66.09 million years

511
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
You will find this one little

512
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Skinny strip of Rock

513
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
That's

514
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
This one skinny Gray Line

515
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
Grey crappie

516
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,600
Doing a very real way that line that you're seeing that represents

517
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
D-Day

518
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
The asteroid

519
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
D-Day

520
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
Just above that line

521
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
That's a little bit after the day

522
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
Just below that line was a little bit before

523
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
The line is called the KT boundary

524
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
And what school is Uconnect

525
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
You can touch

526
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Evidence of

527
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
And in fact her what he did that day was he took it

528
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Peace out in hands at the mall

529
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,200
You hold in your home in the KT boundary

530
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
It's like

531
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Homosexual

532
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Yeah but it's not

533
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
What you're holding is a dark gray mudstone

534
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Carbon-rich meds

535
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
In that must own you'll find all kinds of things and you'll find

536
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
A very rare

537
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
Minerals like iridium

538
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
It probably came in on the app

539
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
The Beltline

540
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Those little glass balls

541
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
I was talking about the little hell balls

542
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
We could get out a microscope and you look at that rock

543
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
You will see them in there

544
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
We put up a funny cartoon of the

545
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
They're all in that line

546
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Perfect you think that line is

547
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
What's it matter

548
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Inch

549
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
Is hidden in there as sort of the story of the

550
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Absolutely

551
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,720
And here's the crazy thing if this is the line right here this

552
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Strip here

553
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
Robert chase the picture of the KT boundary

554
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
You didn't just below the line you were going to find over and over again dinosaurs everybody not going to

555
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Baby Alive

556
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,288
It's just putting some toy dinosaurs under the line and making the move

557
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
Getting in a certain amount of energy which I shouldn't

558
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
But their fossils

559
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,456
And you will find dinosaur fossils

560
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
From Europe

561
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Idaho

562
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
And Montana this one

563
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Says with me

564
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
China

565
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
But

566
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Maybe just go above the law

567
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,232
You don't find any dinosaur So Below the line

568
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
Find the sum look everywhere above

569
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
They haven't

570
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
Everywhere they have looked anyway

571
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
They found

572
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Nothing

573
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
It's a different world that's the amazing thing is a different world

574
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
Innisfree rating

575
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Is one world

576
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
You're literally just pointing

577
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
Pinky to pointer

578
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Finger spread

579
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Miss another moment where

580
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,768
I would urge you at some point. Now keep listening but at some point

581
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
Watch the video of his performance is what Sarah Darren

582
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
Glenn and Keith do in this moment

583
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Officially

584
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Freemason

585
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
Okay so that was the story we told about the end of the dinosaurs live at the Paramount Theater in Seattle

586
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Washington

587
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
When we come back we'll take a quick break right now but when we come back I reported Molly Webster and I will dish about

588
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
What we have just learned

589
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
About

590
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,912
That day

591
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Those

592
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Hours

593
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
So long ago

594
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
We have all

595
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
I know I'm not going to tell you

596
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Stay around

597
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Coming up in just a minute

608
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,168
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

609
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,960
And I'm here because I need your help

610
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,896
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

611
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
Aunts and uncles teachers

612
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

613
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
Williams

614
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
Basically I want to hear about this

615
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
Did you know did something

616
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,696
It just means you lean back and say

617
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Wow

618
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
How do they do that

619
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:05,120
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

620
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,680
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

621
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,032
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

622
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Or maybe the kitchen mat

623
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,640
Music in the margin of their geometry

624
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
We're interested in the

625
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Specific moments where

626
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,784
Kid does something super smart

627
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,832
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

628
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
If you have a story

629
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,208
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

630
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
Record short audio message

631

And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

632
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Thank you so much

633
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,272
Is Radiolab on Chad we are back now you just

634
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
Heard

635
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,904
Are drastic in-the-moment version of the day the dinosaurs all died

636
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Enough

637
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
You're thinking of something different

638
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
It was some

639
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,864
Guy who sort of an amateur and he was lifting he went to South Dakota

640
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
We have enough

641
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
Maybe you should bring them to me

642
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,544
From our reporter Molly Webster who reported that story for us

643
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
Way-back-when and now she is

644
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Here again with

645
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Them

646
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
News

647
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:26,016
Updating the apocalyptical episode which was

648
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
Probably the last time I saw you

649
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
And the reason we're updating it is because

650
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
This science article came out the basically if

651
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
It proves

652
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
To be true

653
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
It could be

654
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
One of the largest

655
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
Paleontological discoveries of the day the dinosaur

656
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,456
First I day claims to tell the story of the first

657
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
15 minutes

658
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
Two three hours

659
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,880
After the asteroid hit down in Mexico

660
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,488
And basically what it is is geologic

661
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Formation that is

662
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,632
Kind of like that line that we song Colorado but like that line on steroid

663
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,960
It's in the southwest corner

664
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Of North Dakota

665
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Those two

666
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
Is not close to the Gulf of Mexico. It's like

667
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
3000 km away

668
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
And this particular site used to be a guess

669
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
The assumption is 66 million years ago that it was kind of like a river but like a river valley that was muddy and

670
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:39,488
Warm and it was near something about the Western interior Seaway

671
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
So then what did they find there

672
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
So one of the authors on this paper is

673
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
On this

674
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,168
Super Famous paleontologist Ian Smith

675
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
He said

676
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
When he went to the site

677
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
And he stood there

678
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
He's like what I see in this place

679
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,456
Is a three-hour story of that day with all the victims

680
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
And it feels like a movie is playing out

681
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Before me

682
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,672
Puerto Rican started turned into a scene by scene by scene Adventure in time

683
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Story that they lay out in the paper

684
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Is that

685
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:18,144
This area within like 15 minutes after the asteroid

686
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
It was

687
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Hit by waves

688
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
From the Western interior sea

689
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,080
And they brought with them

690
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:31,968
Saltwater fish in like seashells and things like into this freshwater area

691
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,320
And then at the same time remember like we talked about those glass balls

692
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
He fell from the sky view

693
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,976
So the story that this area tells is that there are actually kind of like

694
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Three phases

695
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
Of those glass balls of various like size and proportions and some they wouldn't really really far until like space

696
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
And came back and said they came back

697
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Later

698
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,288
Then all the other ones and armoire

699
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
You know it's funny it's like all glass balls in the end really if you're a paleontologist you're really gay

700
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,808
Taking out right now over like the different types of glass balls that this site holds stress balls

701
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,160
Spill of the giant crash and some of them are actually made of

702
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
Particles from the

703
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
Actual impact site like in all of the previous sites they had found in the United States none of those

704
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
Glass balls are actually still glass

705
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,776
They had decomposed into clay apparently glass will change into clay overtime I did not know this

706
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
But in this

707
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
Location they actually have glass

708
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,944
Unaltered by the passage of time

709
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,016
So it holds within it like the air

710
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,856
In geochemistry jobs that day

711
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
And that place

712
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
And they found some that were actually I feel like the such a Jurassic Park when they found some that were trapped in Amber

713
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
That haven't that are totally unaltered

714
00:36:53,888 --> 00:37:00,032
I really don't know anything except for that like Jurassic Park made me think that anything and Amber is really important

715
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
14

716
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
And Jerry Ojos

717
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,040
And I'm just the backup

718
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
Back in the day on the day that this

719
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
This asteroid hit the Earth

720
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
That was a

721
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
Tropical whale population place

722
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeso subtropical well-populated have dinosaurs and it would have

723
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,984
Stores that would have fish it seemed to be covered in trees

724
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
Insects lots of insects

725
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,176
Mammals looks like yeah whatever our oldest man was

726
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Yes it was a really like Lush

727
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
Happening area

728
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
And what they see

729
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,368
In this site that they've uncovered today

730
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
Is what appears to be instantaneous death

731
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Describe

732
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,304
Fish that are stacked dead fish besides fish

733
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,864
That are stacked like logs and it's

734
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Freshwater fish and marine fish

735
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,728
And they do describe it as like a mass grave

736
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
There are fish

737
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,056
Fossils like wrapped around

738
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Tree bases

739
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,200
Like like creatures and plants and stones and Pebbles and shellfish and everything

740
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,784
Saltwater freshwater everything with smooshed together

741
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,392
Tumble of light that was like Throne like almost like thrown together in a wash in like

742
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:23,232
Mixed up you know if you're if you're an animal

743
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
In that moment you're there

744
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,096
And something happens in Mexico and you have no idea

745
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
But maybe about

746
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,520
15 minutes after that thing happened in Mexico that you have no idea about you might feel the Earth Rumble

747
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:41,152
There's some shaking and then that rumbling that shaking

748
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,736
I'm comes with it a big wave from the sea

749
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
And so you get this big

750
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
It comes in

751
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
And then what happens is that

752
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,440
Comes in as you're already starting to get

753
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
The glass balls from the heaven

754
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
And so

755
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
And what they see is you get this like wave of kind of what seems to be almost like raining glass balls

756
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
And then that's like Mick

757
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,056
Stand with the mud from like the title

758
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
And the layers of things that are dying

759
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,992
The fish like some of the details that stand out to me the most

760
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
The fish are all

761
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,856
Generally pointed in the same direction

762
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
And they're like

763
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
Stacked pretty tightly mouths open

764
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
And their fins

765
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Splayed

766
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,816
But one of the things I think it's super cool is that

767
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,424
All that different stuff we talked about happening across the globe in are original

768
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Show

769
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Probably got really hot

770
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
But you know that was Jay melosh was like it's really hot that Robertson was talking about like the boiler the boiler effect and then we talked

771
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
What about the flashing blue light we talked about things raining from the sky and we talked about June or July all that's

772
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,880
Stuff a lot of that stuff was based on really smart models

773
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,464
This seems to be a place it actually will

774
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
Provide evidence

775
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
Either for or against those models

776
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,096
How much are tree trunks

777
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:08,704
Which I think made like Jay melosh really happy cuz he was like I did get really hot

778
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
Tea towel and then they're like the fish wrapped around trees

779
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,872
And then there appears to be a dinosaur bone

780
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,432
Possibly dinosaur bones

781
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Skin still attached

782
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,600
Kirk Johnson said if if that is if it really is a dinosaur bone and that site is connected

783
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,696
Did the asteroid impact like I think it is it would be the youngest dinosaur ever

784
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,560
My last question is is there something we need to know about the man whose

785
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Dig this

786
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
That would

787
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
Color are feelings about the studies

788
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,544
Author the main authors this guy Robert DePalma he's in his late 30s

789
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
Does not have a PhD

790
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
He works

791
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,736
A lot outside of normal Academia but

792
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
Jay melosh who is in our first thing

793
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,880
He is the editor on the on the article

794
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
And then

795
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
Walter Alvarez and Ian smitter in the article

796
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Are co-authors

797
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
And then this other guy like Mark Mark Richards who's like a really famous

798
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
Tsunami earthquake guy

799
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
So you think he's got a collection of people around him and I think everyone else says like if the stuff that they say that they have is

800
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
There

801
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
It's amazing

802
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
They do think one of the things in the paper like is like

803
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
People are like you are claiming

804
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
To know a 3-hour window 66 million years ago that is a very big claim right you're really

805
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Going to have to produce

806
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
A lot of evidence

807
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,120
And I think that people think it could be there

808
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,448
But you convinced me if you got

809
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,592
It look like a animal all squished up together all at once and you got rain that you can account for

810
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
In different stages

811
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
And that looks like you're right there at the

812
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Black moment plus 3 hours

813
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,295
And everything's dead and

814
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,367
The forest is burned just like if it's almost like it's

815
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,255
Exactly what we said I know I was like well I'm hooked it's just it does leave you at the end of the day

816
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,119
Feeling a little bit nervous to be on this big safe blue.

817
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,703
Recognizing that we are so vulnerable with life

818
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Is really fragile

819
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
When a pebble

820
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Can

821
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
Murder know what I think is the crazy part is

822
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
If you were an animal

823
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
Standing in North Dakota

824
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
You would have no idea what was happening

825
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,391
There's like I like logic I like to be able to say oh there's a source

826
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
And then nothing happened

827
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,327
And to just be there and all of a sudden the Earth starts rattling like a bell around you and then a title

828
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,399
Wave comes in and then I'm dead

829
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
Casino

830
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:54,079
Like that to me is the most is the most stunning part is it should have salt on your mouth

831
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
Yeah it's just

832
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
It's just like

833
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,783
To just be standing there unawares and then a

834
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
Thing happens

835
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
That really has nothing to do with you

836
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Nothing

837
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
That's a weird

838
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Heart to me
