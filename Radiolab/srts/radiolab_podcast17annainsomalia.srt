Whatever images the word Somalia calls to mind

53
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
The Somalia where Muhammad lived was in a cultural Renaissance

54
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
This is 1981 it was under communist rule

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
The Dictator

56
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
What's the dictator but he was also a big fan of Somali culture and music

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,368
Music was sexully big part of how Muhammad courted Isfahan he made her mixtapes

58
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
This was the 80s

59
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Juicing or did she say

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Oh she's a bit the singer

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,752
A few months after Muhammad and his mom got married

62
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,640
Muhammad got a phone call from the director of local public Hospital

63
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,760
Donations from the community she was desperate for donations

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Forbidding

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
That music-loving dictator his name was Siad Barre a

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
He cut off supplies to the hospital

67
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,000
In retaliation for an independence movement in the region

68
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
The doctor's been calling all his friends and Secret

69
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
Directions you know people can we raise the money discreetly ourselves

70
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,848
But Muhammad wanted to go big or suppose maybe I want to share my happiness

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
What do you mean by share your happiness

72
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Unicorn tribute

73
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Customer other people who are less fortunate than us

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Muhammad was in that stage of new love when you just kind of think the world is full of good feeling and if everybody knew it was going

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Going on they would do the right thing

76
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
Any take this bold and pretty risky move

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
He writes

78
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
A letter from kinda nice letter about Hospital conditions conditions

79
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,311
Especially implying that the dictator is not doing right by us and we got to step up ourselves

80
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,455
Couple weeks later Muhammad and his pain heard a knock on their door in the middle of the night

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
The Arsenal why don't want anything like that

82
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
It's just that we need to take him

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
You see that

84
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
My wife

85
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951

86
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Fluff

87
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Esoteric

88
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
Muhammad is accused of treason

89
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
And sentenced to life in solitary confinement

90
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Since way

91
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
And this is where the story really begins

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,183
Muhammad cell is Tiny maybe 6ft by 6ft

93
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Concrete walls

94
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Hole in the floor for toilet

95
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
And a window high up that lets in just a little bit of light

96
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Better.

97
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Cockroach

98
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Come from the toilet

99
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Cockroaches cockroaches in the light of the world

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Puts you

101
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Instruments with

102
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Defi

103
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Sweet

104
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
On their feet would be excrement from the toilet

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
After cockroaches come from rats

106
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
The mice

107
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Mosquitoes

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Alarm supply Mesquite

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Like an engine jet engine

110
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
But even worse than that sound

111
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
Is buzzing in his own mind

112
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,495
Because in this present there is one rule to strictly forbidden

113
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
What's your name

114
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
He's forbidden to speak the other inmates

115
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Forward and backward

116
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Back pacing back and forth

117
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
And this is a tiny place to

118
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Go back and forth from this

119
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
So that three short steps forward three shirts as backwards Resources phone

120
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
So that is his life now

121
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Until one day

122
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
He hears a knock

123
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
On the wall

124
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Knock knock

125
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Becomes

126
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Words

127
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Another time

128
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
In another place

129
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
All happy families are alike

130
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Each unhappy family

131
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
I'm happy it's only

132
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
This is rough translation the show from NPR

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
At Gregory there

134
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Vegas

135
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
Hey we should do you want to just tell us what rough translation is so I've been making a podcast this year

136
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
The idea is that

137
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
In every episode we follow a conversation we're having in the United States

138
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
KIRO that's playing out

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
In a different place when episode we might

140
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
Hear about how fake news is playing out in Ukraine which is been getting fake news for longer and higher doses than any

141
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Sing America sing imagine

142
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
We're hearing about a Transit happening more now we're Chinese women are hiring American surrogates to have their babies

143
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Tim

144
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,775
Basically every episode we try to do the same thing just sort of see

145
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Something we have a see what the other folks yeah

146
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Which is not like what we saying

147
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,247
I'm guessing this one we have a guy locked away in a Somali prison should we

148
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Just get play and see what happens

149
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
8 months into Muhammad's prison sentence

150
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Then he's in a Cell that's always

151
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
He's alone

152
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Not quite

153
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Peddler

154
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
So many different types of ancestors

155
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
China

156
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Was like watching a film

157
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Facebook

158
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
3D

159
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
To look around for food

160
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
383 t-shirt

161
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
When are you

162
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407

163
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
It's another with

164
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Able

165
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Have loved to go

166
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
See you at that Hill there

167
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
The horse the Whitley wood stain

168
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
But I couldn't go see for sale

169
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Concrete

170
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
And then

171
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,583
One evening when the guard is at the other end of the line of cells just out of earshot

172
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
The guy in the cell next to Muhammad

173
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Whispers

174
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
So what the door saying Glenn ABC

175
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
To the one playing ABC Photo

176
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
Learn ABC through the body remembers

177
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,687
End end does that make any sense to Muhammad them on zero says

178
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Are you looking at the road between us

179
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
But then

180
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
But then he knocks on the wall

181
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Piccadilly's

182
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
And when Muhammad leaned over to the wall

183
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
I could hear the sound

184
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Shark

185
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
So you have a sharp sound and a kind of

186
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399

Divorce in Somali Society in Islam is usually the husband's exclusive right

But there are the quranic verses that can allow a wife to choose to divorce her husband if the husband absent for some time

239
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671

I am in this place

251
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
At first it's just a little twinge of resentment

252
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Then the feeling comes back

253
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295

00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
In touch with you

262
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,447
And and what do you think about her in those moments when you're blaming her for not to

00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215

Every time that Muhammad is tapped one of these dark thoughts on to the wall

267
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Someone was listening

268
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Someone on the other side of the wall

269
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Was a doctor

270
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
Dr. Adam nebeker

271
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
Is the doctors listening fees Taps on the wall

274
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
He's also diagnosing them

275
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Acute anxiety

276
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
You was telling me the symptoms

277
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
Through the wall

278
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
I should tell you that doctor adhan and Muhammad we're actually friends

279
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Before present

280
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
The doctor with the director of the public hospital going to call them up and ask them for donation

281
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
You did not ask Muhammad to write that letter

282
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Complaining about the hospital conditions

283
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
Cuz there was no press Allowed no newspapers

284
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
No Free Press

285
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
And that's the moment the government decided that

286
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
They should do something about us

287
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,495
But if the doctor blame Mohammed for writing the letter that got them both thrown in prison

288
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
He didn't show it every time that Muhammad. Whatever the hour the doctor would not back

289
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
You still have these nightmares

290
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
So he jumps

291
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
It has a nice man and that he knocks on the wall again

292
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Do I have to wake up

293
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
And then I can start conversation in a show.

294
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
Fall asleep again just like a baby

295
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Tibetan making you fall asleep

296
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
If dr. Allen seems fairly unsentimental about some of the more dramatic aspects of Muhammad's life

297
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
It's partly that these two men are such different personalities

298
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,431
Will Muhammad describe that nighttime arrested the moment of shock and Terror

299
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,271
Dr. Adam seems to have met the same secret police with a bag

300
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Packed and ready for prison

301
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Bag of clothes

302
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Lots and lots of books

303
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Books is the best

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Befriending in a prison

305
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
But then when you go to

306
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
The Prisoner was taken away the back room

307
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Assume

308
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
Tell me about the day you learn the language

309
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Bellaire the Nook

310
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Well

311
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
It was the most exciting day in your life

312
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
It was the most exciting and we couldn't sleep

313
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Way to go me ask this this knocking this is something that they are they all were doing there was a particular line of 8

314
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,487
Prisoners of these eight prisoners it was a particular guy in the in the middle there who

315
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
At once heard of Morse code

316
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
And

317
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
Just lying there in prison one day thought hey what if I ended the language and we can talk also this was actually a home

318
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,799
SpongeBob he did not know Morse code he just knew of

319
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
And the guards couldn't hear that that was something that was their own

320
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,759
Right let me know literally they could this was kind of the magic of it they could be just

321
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
Tapping on the wall they could be having a whole conversation and the guard would have no idea what they were

322
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Say

323
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
We started practicing in the whole day and all night

324
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
And if there's a joke

325
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
And somebody loves

326
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Everybody stop smoking on the wall

327
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
And asking that's red what's that joke about

328
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
And the dead guy

329
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Stop

330
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Sending the message the joke

331
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,127
And it goes from 1 to take an hour to send it tiny joke from one cell

332
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
The next South the neck

333
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
There were eight of them in this prison

334
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
Cuz they don't know that we're knocking on the wall because they can't hear

335
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,135
I'm the one that she is all laughing they just said all this girl

336
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
These guys are also losing their

337
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Sanity

338
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:04,095
Meanwhile on the other side of the wall Muhammad really was worried that his mind was slipping

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
I was frightened of going

340
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
Twisted Canadian my mind

341
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
When I commit suicide without knowing

342
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Without

343
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Wangjing

344
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Is it almost like

345
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
The fear of going crazy with make me crazy

346
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Imagine people who are Christian

347
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
Imagine that maybe

348
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Going crazy with supporting

349
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Norton

350
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Sawyer

351
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
Try to understand why the doctor on his side of the wall

352
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
And I was trying to come selenium

353
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
And explain to him to the wall

354
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
He's not going to go mad and that he's not going to die

355
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
But

356
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
You can cancel person through a wall

357
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Months go by

358
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Been a whole year

359
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Finally it's

360
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
2 years of their prison sentence

361
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
And something happens

362
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Doctor addend is summoned to the office of the warden

363
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
To get a change of clothes

364
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
The room was empty and there was a bench

365
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
The Oscar to sit on the bench and then he asked

366
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
He asked one of Augusta Grand Prix your bank

367
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
The whole bag with all your clothes or books ever

368
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,703
And that hit you up or are you open that bag and then he tells you to choose

369
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Something new to wear

370
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
And you don't choose anything else

371
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
He says don't use anything else

372
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
Not this was a relationship. Just getting his first change of clothes since he arrived in prison

373
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,623
To choose your next t-shirt the doctor turns to the warden he lets him right in the eye

374
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Can I have one book question that's wrong

375
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Him and I

376
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
Did not expect that he would agree to give me so I was just

377
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,423
I just tried you and he said yes you can choose one of your books

378
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:50,591
So then I started thinking of the all the biggest spook I can take with me a few minutes later the doctor he is walking

379
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
Back to his cell with the fattest book in his bag under his arm you can picture and fantasizing about just getting to lie down and read

380
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,623
Read that when he returns to his self there's that sound

381
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,255
At the wall took her to me the thought that what anti-free this before infinity War

382
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
And distract the negative thoughts

383
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Miwa Muhammad on his side of the wall

384
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Here's the new set of taps

385
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Haven't pooped

386
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287

387
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311

Anakin

389
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
I like rain

390
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Anna Karenina

391
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
The famous novel by Leo Tolstoy

392
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
Published in 1878 the English translation that they're using

393
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159

Nearly 2 million letters

396
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Each letter

397
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Set of TAPS for the doctor prepares

398
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
So

399
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Just stop

400
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
I took

401
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Piece of my

402
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Bed sheets

403
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Hayabusa.

404
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
I don't like

405
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
She's prepping for a medical procedure

406
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Wrapping the sheet around his wrist and knuckle

407
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
Cuz it'll be like that

408
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
So then I started knocking

409
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
And he started listening

410
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
All happy families are alike

411
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,255
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way

412
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,143
Everything was in confusion in the oblonsky house the wife had discovered that the husband

413
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
The effect

414
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
Did those TAPS in that book had on Muhammad's mind

415
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567

It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

427
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

429
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,031
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

430
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

Marked a new phase for Muhammad and the doctor

441
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Each morning dr. Adam wood

442
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
Carefully wrap his hands

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
And open the novel

444
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
Muhammad on his side of the wall

445
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
But listen

446
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
When he was dressed

447
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Stepan arkadyevitch

448
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Sprinkles

Pocketbook matches and watch

452
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
But it's double chain and seals

453
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
And

454
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Checking out his handkerchief

455
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Feeling himself Queen fragrant

456
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
Healthy and physically at ease

457
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Spite of his unhappiness

458
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,208
He walks with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room

459
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Coffee with

460
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
If it's been awhile since you cracked open on a creditor

461
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Here's what you need to know

462
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,984
Anna is Noble woman in nineteenth-century Russian she's married to a man much older than herself

463
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,104
She goes to a ball in a black velvet dress line with lace and falls in love with Soldier

464
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Count France

465
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,504
Rich boy careless love Muhammad immediately hates him

466
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
And I was hating anything in uniform actually

467
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Wedding first season

468
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
American filter

469
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,768
Right he's in the military and you were in a military prison

470
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,608
If you really didn't like ROTC

471
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
So anyway the soldier vronsky

472
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,032
Steals on his heart he gets her pregnant even though she still married to the other guy and then on a mix

473
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
The choice that really changes everything

474
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Because instead of having a secret affair

475
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Like all the others in her social set

476
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
She makes her love Papa

477
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
She leaves her husband

478
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
And

479
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Society the Russian nobility

480
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832

4

485
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
But Anna's realizing how alone she is

486
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,400
She's staying in a room wondering what Bronski is up to when he's not with her

487
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
Just the same as Muhammad was

488
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Wondering what his wife was doing

489
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Outside the Prison Walls

490
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,848
Muhammad read me this one sentence from the book beloved her

491
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Sorry

492
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,528
If we David had he would understand all the difficulty of her situation

493
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Are you prescribed from it

494
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
If you loved her

495
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
He would rescue her from her situation

496
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
San Jacinto

497
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Is traps

498
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256

499
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
Reviews about women and maybe desire

500
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
But you were trapped

501
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
Buy real wolves

502
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
It didn't matter how different their lives seemed

503
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
On the outside

504
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Inside

505
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
She was suffering all the time

506
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
He felt

507
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Exact Lagana

508
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,040
He also was jealous crazily jealous and also hating himself for being jealous

509
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,648
And all the sudden he meets this fictional character who is suffering

510
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
In exactly the same way

511
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
And is suffering

512
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,560
Is driving her into a state that Muhammad most feared for himself

513
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Going

514
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
The second alien my man

515
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
When I go to commit suicide without knowing without

516
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Wangjing

517
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,824
Cessna 750 pages into the book

518
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,432
And 2 months have passed since the doctor first started tapping the book letter by letter

519
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,064
Anna and vronsky are now living in Moscow and it's summer so it's hot and suffocating

520
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,160
And on this particular day Bronski is off visiting his mom which

521
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,744
Anna hates because she thinks she's trying to set him up with a young princess

522
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
An honest in the State of Mind where

523
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,632
Chipotle thinks that she's a burden to front ski and she

524
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Pixie be better off without her

525
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,264
But also she wants him to suffer her absence the way

526
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
She's suffering

527
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,664
It's in the state that on a bunch of walking down a train platform

528
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,296
The train is hurtling down the track and this thought possesses her

529
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
She knew what she had to do

530
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
What are rapid lightning. She went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stocks

531
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,960
Quite near the approaching train

532
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
And he's thinking about what she's about to do

533
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Shady tribe

534
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
Except for her

535
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,248
But he realizes his tears are not just from one of my wife

536
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
He's remembering Islam

537
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
His wife is she suffering

538
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,696
The bouqs one that brought me back to

539
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
Think about that a lot

540
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,888
And he finds himself asking a question that in two years in prison he's not asked himself before

541
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Did I do well

542
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Those few months we were together

543
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Had he been a good husband

544
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
Military time

545
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
Instead of thinking

546
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
She's left him

547
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
And also hating himself for thinking that she's left him

548
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
He's thinking why did he take himself away from her

549
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,136
I writing that stupid newsletter

550
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
In a different way

551
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,512
That letter that got them all thrown in prison if you could have talked to them

552
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,072
Putting himself in his wife's shoes like that

553
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
It kind of took him out of his own misery

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
He could think about like

555
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Pizza Pit West

556
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
And then me

557
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Cuz I was wondering presumptuous

558
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
And outside with

559
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
It goes from self-pity

560
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
The pity for her

561
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,552
I think that's related to the books tell stories they actually famous for that that's like his magic crazy Talent

562
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Can you say more about that magic crazy Talent cuz like

563
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
When I was

564
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
I told elif batuman about Muhammad story

565
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
Heard her reading Tolstoy passages for us

566
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,120
She's also a writer novelist yourself and totally obsessed with on a credit I like it alot

567
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
When I told her about Muhammad's experience

568
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
She had this idea

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
About why that book in particular might have helped Muhammad

570
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
Make this mental leap from

571
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Hating his wife

572
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
Imagining everything through her eyes

573
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
Customer gives a lot of weight to to all of the characters like even suggest like a newlywed young girl you spend a lot of time in her thoughts

574
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
And there's like a scene where she's trying to

575
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,928
Eat a mushroom on a plate and it keeps slipping from under her for

576
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
Time Juventus. Disobedient

577
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Slippery Mushroom in hair

578
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
4

579
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
I shaking delays

580
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Full retard

581
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Show lights

582
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,264
It's a book that takes the subjectivity of young women seriously

583
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,152
And not just young women everyone that servants and I'm the dog there's a hunting scene in this that's dumb

584
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
Actually goes to the perspective of the dog

585
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,552
And and everything just seems so true you read that near like that's definitely what that dog was thinking

586
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
And so she says the experience of reading Tolstoy is the experience of being constantly confronted with how differently the

587
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
The same thing can look from us

588
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Slightly different perspective like he's just he never gets bored of showing that and in the book the characters themselves

589
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
Judge each other and then are able to expand that and to see each other a little bit more generously that's what elephants do

590
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
That tell stories book

591
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Gave to Muhammad

592
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Tiffany's cat

593
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
Didactic definition definition

594
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
In a place like

595
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Like that person

596
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,624
People become very selfish you think everybody has forgotten about me

597
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,184
At the beginning.

598
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
And nobody cares about me like that

599
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,072
What do you think about other people's situation than you

600
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
You understand it's helping me

601
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Senpai help me

602
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
Even sleep better

603
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Tolstoy actually had one more role to play

604
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
Muhammad's wife

605
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
8 years after his arrest

606
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Somali political winds shifted and

607
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
The dictator was trying to appease his enemies

608
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
Muhammad and the others were suddenly released

609
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,368
He discovered his region of Somalia was flattened by Civil War

610
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
But it also discovered something else

611
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
His wife is mine

612
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
She was still as what

613
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
She is not giving up on him

614
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
And she had suffered in his absence

615
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Working at the State Bank

616
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
She's been pressured by your boss to divorce

617
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
The traitor Muhammad

618
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
When she refused she was relocated

619
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
And by the time Muhammad was released

620
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
You're living in a refugee camp

621
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
In Germany she couldn't even make it back to Somalia to see him

622
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
So I waited another day that was

623
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Another

624
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
See about 10 months

625
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Go to see each other

626
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,512
Finally they figure out a way that they can reunite in a neighboring country

627
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
And though it's been almost

628
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
A decade since they seen each other

629
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
You recognized her immediately from a disc

630
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
And if they drew closer

631
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Is Van opens her arms to

632
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Give her husband a hug

633
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
And he reaches out

634
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
And all that he could do in that moment

635
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Is shake her hand

636
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,744
Do I not feel as I felt even even prison I was feeling so much in love with her

637
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
And yet when we met

638
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
She was like a

639
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
You know something like that

640
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Well

641
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
I mean

642
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
I will

643
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Asking myself

644
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Why do you not

645
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Ice in love with her

646
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
This was a moment

647
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
That we found really

648
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
Interesting and

649
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,928
As we were talking about it with Greg Studio

650
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
Greg said it was really In This Moment

651
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,072
This. Of Dow is overcome by a momentary doubt

652
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
Of the possibility

653
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Setting up

654
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
That new life

655
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Dreamed of on the way

656
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
That the book came back to Muhammad

657
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Again

658
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:39,104
Except this time you didn't think of the main character and he thought of a different character in the book A guy by the name of

659
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
11

660
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
This is a character who is

661
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,992
I also love also has

662
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Like strong emotions

663
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
And like Muhammad in that one moment with his wife

664
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
Levin spends the entire book

665
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,720
RAC by doubts

666
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,048
But everything and eternal dissatisfaction with yourself

667
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
Man attempts to improve and failures

668
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
And then Eternal X

669
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Location of the heart

670
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
And standing there with his wife

671
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
Is weirded out by his own lack of

672
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Feeling

673
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
Muhammad had two thoughts like oh

674
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,384
I'm like leaven In This Moment

675
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
And

676
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
What happens to 11 at the end

677
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:22,112
And what's really cool about Levin's conclusively of the book is he finally just decides like I'm not going to worry about how weird my feeling

678
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
But she doesn't

679
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,976
Actually come he doesn't make himself whole

680
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,304
As he wants to be he wants to the whole book he wants to be

681
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
Fully in love with Kitty and not just with his heart but with his mind soul and want to be a good Christian and everything has

682
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
It sort of makes sense

683
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,592
But you know but he's just a complicated sort of

684
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
Guy in and got many

685
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
Different feeling for the end of the book it kind of feels like

686
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
You know

687
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm going to stop

688
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Just

689
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,648
Thinking obsessively about how awkward I am in this situation

690
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
And I'm just going to

691
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Dealer supposed to

692
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
I'm going to be the dad

693
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm going to be the husband

694
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
And Muhammad thought to himself

695
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Like maybe I need to do that too because

696
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
Who knows where I'm at right now I was in a Cell for 8 years

697
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
In the prison

698
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
In a way you wouldn't be living

699
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
You're still

700
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Inside yourself you have no.

701
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
You have to open

702
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
Minifigures Lego

703
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
Opening back up

704
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
It's probably going to take some time

705
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,368
And some work we have to learn to love each other again

706
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
And daddy says

707
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
What they did

708
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
Aeropostale had a lot to do with it

709
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
You think Tolstoy helps you fall in love again

710
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
I mean I mean

711
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,216
Meaning of love you know it wasn't so easy

712
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
Love again

713
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
This man has

714
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Inexperience and she was living God real life

715
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
Difficult for people to

716
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Brother to live with someone who has been

717
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
Is solitary confinement for so long

718
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,112
I was protopage got to leave it at that particular time

719
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
And you're saying that knowing

720
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,488
That you are hard to live with knowing it

721
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Yes made it easier for us to

722
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
Talk to each other to

723
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Live

724
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
Plant live with each other

725
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,472
Because you knew that if your heart was not

726
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Quite working yet

727
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:27,040
I should be that moment for life book

728
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
Hey one last thing

729
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
There is someone else to give credit to here besides the Great

730
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,864
Russian author every detail the Tolstoy wrote into that book

731
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,704
Every perspective shift that helped Muhammad Escape his prison cell

732
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
All the sentences had to be

733
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Tapped Out

734
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
On a concrete wall

735
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
My friend I could imagine him getting tired

736
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
