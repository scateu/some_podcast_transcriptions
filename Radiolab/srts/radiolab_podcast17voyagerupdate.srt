1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
All right but tell us who you are

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:28,160
I am needy Mom we are in Hopkinsville Kentucky for the great

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
American eclipse

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:36,096
We are about a minute to totality look I can see it even when I'm even

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
When it's not on we can hear the cicadas

9
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
And we

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,080
I don't even have my sunglasses on I can I can

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,176
Still can't look at it

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
What do you think of this way

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:57,344
Looks like a storm coming in

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Jupiter

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Oh my God

16
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
Oh my God

17
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Nothing there you look it up

18
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Oh my God

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Oh my God

20
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,184
Susie Duran

21
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Holy toledo

22
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Oh my God

23
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,992
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod kush's Radiolab

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
Answer these last few weeks on planet Earth

25
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
In this corner planet Earth have been a little confusing

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Little crazy

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
But then there was yesterday we all got a chance to look up

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
Look up at the sun people said this recordings from all over the place

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Helen Georgia Nashville Tennessee Kenmore Washington

30
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Watching the moon pass right in front of the sun that's the moon in front of the Sun

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:35,904
The moon blocking the Sun

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
They got to see you hear these recordings and you can't help but think

33
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
Going to be alright

34
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Beautiful

35
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Oh my God

36
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Silk

37
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
In honor of the celestial miracle

38
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Today we're going to keep looking up

39
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
But

40
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Not in the direction of the sun when you look up at the sun you have to put on these glasses to you too to protect yourself from

41
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
In the sunshine

42
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Sunshine is very powerful

43
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
Stretches across vast

44
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Vast vast

45
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Vast distances in space

46
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,664
What we going to do with the ends Travis we're going to leave the sunshine behind we're actually going to escape the sunshine

47
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
What humans have never been before right

48
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
And we're going to start

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
With a story that

50
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
I've been falling pretty much my entire career Radiolab

51
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
You can have to run back 1977 SS not when I started

52
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Following story that's when the story itself started

53
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,608
In August of 1977 NASA

54
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Launched

55
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
A spacecraft and on the craft with a gold record

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
And the record carried a message this is a message from us

57
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
To them

58
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Out there

59
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
Our story it was Carl Sagan Cosmos

60
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Is all that is

61
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Or ever was

62
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Or ever will be

63
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,112
Led the team that made that record of that team included actually was headed by

64
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
A woman named

65
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Android

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
10 years ago

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,559
I spoke with an e and we made the story you're about to hear

68
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Visit Annie at her home Ithaca

69
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
New York and we sat in the backyard near waterfall

70
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
In the same spot she says where Carl himself would say

71
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
And become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer

72
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Right

73
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
Next time my name is Annie Drury Inn

74
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
And M

75
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,111
I was honored to be the creative director of the Voyager Interstellar

76
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Message project

77
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
Which began in

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Early 1977

79
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Come about

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
I think about the project now and

81
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
And so

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,495
Exciting to think about I mean it's such a romantic idea did you know that at the time

83
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Absolutely felt

84
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
First of all that this was a kind of

85
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Sacred

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Trust

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Bad here we were

88
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
Half a dozen very flawed human being

89
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
Wave that you just huge

90
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
Holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects

91
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Building

92
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Cultural

93
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Noah's Ark

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
It was a chance to tell something

95
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
What life on Earth was like

96
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Two beings of perhaps

97
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
A thousand million years from now

98
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Because they

99
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
The Voyager Engineers were saying This Record will have a shelf life

100
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
A billion years

101
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
That didn't race

102
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Goosebumps when you have to be made of wood

103
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
I was also the but the

104
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
The season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other

105
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
And here we were

106
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Taking on this method

107
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Challenge

108
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
And knowing

109
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
It before it was John

110
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Two spacecraft

111
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
Would lift off from the planet Earth

112
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Moving at an average speed of

113
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
35000 miles an hour

114
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
For the next thousand million years

115
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
And on it would be a kiss

116
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
A mother's first words to her newborn baby

117
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Beto

118
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Greetings in the 59 most

119
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Populist

120
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
Human languages clothes from the children

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Planet Earth

122
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
As well as one Nan Yuan language did

123
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Waiting for the humpback whale

124
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
And it was a sacred Undertaker

125
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Because it was saying

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
We want to be citizens of the cosmos

127
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
I want you to know about that

128
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Tell me what the mummy found love with Carl Sagan you said it was during the Voyager compilation

129
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Yes it was it was June 1st 1977 I've been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music

130
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,807
Take that we could put on the Voyager record and not feel like an idiot for having done so and done

131
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
I was very excited because I finally

132
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,231
Found a ethnomusicologist composer at Columbia University

133
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,327
Who told me without a moment's hesitation

134
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
That this peace flowing streams

135
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Which

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,471
Was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
A Chinese music 2500 years old

138
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
What's the piece we should put on the record

139
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
So I called

140
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Carl Lewis

141
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Traveling

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
He was in Tucson Arizona giving a talk

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
And done we've been alone many times

144
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
During the making

145
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
The record and his friends for 3 years

146
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
And neither of us had ever

147
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,119
Said anything to the other we're both in popular people

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
We had a wonderful

149
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Storing conversation

150
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
But

151
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,591
We should both been completely just professional about everything in his friends

152
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Ndk

153
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
He wasn't there left a message

154
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Our leaders

155
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Phone rings

156
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Pick up the phone

157
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
And I hear this wonderful voice

158
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,439
Did he say I get back to my hotel room and I find this message and it says

159
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Any cars

160
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
And I say to myself

161
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Can you leave me this message 10 years ago

162
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
And my heart

163
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Sweet lady

164
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Skip to be

165
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
I can still remember it so

166
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Perfectly

167
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
And I said

168
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
For Keeps

169
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Did he said you mean get married

170
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
And I said yes

171
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
And you know

172
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
Even have any other kind of personal discussion before

173
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
We both hang up the phone

174
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
And I did

175
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Read out loud I remember it

176
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
So well cuz it was his great

177
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Eureka moment

178
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
It was just like a scientific discovery

179
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,239
And then the phone rang and I was thinking phone

180
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,591
It was Carla he's actually make sure that really happened we're getting married right

181
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
I said yeah we're getting married he said okay

182
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Just wanted to make sure

183
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
And done

184
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
Spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and August

185
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
XXII

186
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
We

187
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Told everyone involved and we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 in December

188
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
Wow romantic obviously

189
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,103
Part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brain wave

190
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
My heart my eyes everything in that meditation on the record

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,391
I have Carl whether or not would be possible to

192
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Compressed

193
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,767
The impulses in one's brain and nervous system

194
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Into

195
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Sound and then

196
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
Put that sound on the record and then

197
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
I think that perhaps the Extra-Terrestrial

198
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Of the future would be able to reconstitute

199
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
That

200
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Data into thought

201
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
And he looked at me

202
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Beautiful

203
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,223
May Day in New York City and said well you know

204
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Thousand million years is a long time you know why don't you go do it because who knows you know who knows with

205
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
About twenty thousand million years

206
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
And so on

207
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
My brain waves and REM every little sound that my body was making with

208
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
Recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York

209
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,031
This was two days after

210
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Carlin die

211
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Declared our love for each other and so

212
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
What I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now it does somebody flags that record an and

213
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
I always wondered because part of what I was thinking in this meditation

214
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,463
Was about The Wonder of love and of being in love

215
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
And you know it's on those two spacecraft

216
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Goodnow inmate whenever I'm down

217
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,215
Yeah I'm thinking it's still they move 35000 miles an hour

218
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Leaving our solar system

219
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,407
For the Great Wide Open see if Interstellar space

220
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
Billions of years from now the sun will it reduced this planet to a charred Ashleigh Ball

221
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,143
That record with Androids brain waves and heartbeat on it will still be out there somewhere in tact

222
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
It's a remote region of the Milky Way preserving a murmur

223
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
Ancient civilization that once flourished

224
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
On a distant planet

225
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
That's how we ended the original story

226
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,999
It helps to BRC the 40th anniversary of the Voyager probes launched

227
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Between the two dates were Pro one pro tour launched it's a weird thing about the anniversary and

228
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,031
A Preacher Man around chick called up and running again and they got to talking about the fact that we still

229
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,615
Scientists are still talking to those probes that's the thing that gets me

230
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Here we are 40 years later

231
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,759
Are we still in contact with Voyager 1

232
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
We still know

233
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
We born to run into our

234
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
We were able to build something

235
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
So well

236
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Deputy energy

237
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Which is essentially

238
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Morphe people

239
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Any energy in a

240
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Toaster

241
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
We can communicate

242
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Voyager

243
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,335
As she leaves to wander the Milky Way galaxy

244
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Intact

245
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
With a message intact well

246
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
The same engineers said it would work

247
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Forgotten years is 40 years and it still work

248
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
So coming up we're going to ask

249
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Where are they at

250
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Where specifically are those two probes

251
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Now and the answer is

252
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
They're in a very

253
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Very very undiscovered play

254
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
EBay

255
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
I learning things

256
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
That we have never known

257
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
Skyways riding talk to you

258
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Angleton sunbeams ride downtown

259
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
Play this is Becca I'm calling from Dallas Texas to let you know that radio

260
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Do you like it supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

261
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

262
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,591
More information about Sloan at www.smud.org

263
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,967
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

264
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,087
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

265
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teacher

266
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,095
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance

267
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,191
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

268
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,055
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that

269
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,175
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

270
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

271
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,951
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

272
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
We're interested in the

273
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Specific moments where

274
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,887
A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
If you have a story please share it with us

276
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

277
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Record short audio message

278
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

279
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Thank you so much

280
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich is Radiolab and now we're going to ask where are those Voyager probes

281
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Right now this is a story with bun

282
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,007
Falling forever in about 5 years ago

283
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Producer Lynn Levy

284
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,383
Begin to ask yourself that question where are they because at that point

285
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
News was starting to Bubble Up

286
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
That the that the Voyager probes

287
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
We're about to tiptoe their way up

288
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
Cross a truly amazing

289
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Threshold

290
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
And at that moment it wasn't completely clear what was

291
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
So here's what we reported them

292
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
We're going to break in a certain point in update things even further but

293
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
Lynn began this story where the last one left.

294
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Okay so would like in the point of the mission wasn't really to deliver this record it was to go out and look at

295
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
All the planets in the outer solar system

296
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,503
So starting in 1977 these two little spaceships to spacecraft

297
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Voyager 1 and 2 went racing away from Earth snapping pictures

298
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
And so every time

299
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
Where should we reach another planet

300
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
You know all of the Voyager people would get together

301
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,351
Going to the Imaging room and see the pictures

302
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Come from the outer solar

303
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Do you remember seeing them

304
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
I remember the child saying Life magazine in Iowa

305
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
7

306
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Voyager was launched

307
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
This is me.

308
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:52,223
Professor at Boston University as a grown up she became part of the Voyager team

309
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
All the pictures

310
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
But you know as a kid

311
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
You look at the books in to see what how Neptune look

312
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Revelations

313
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Saturn the image of Saturn taxicaller I like pink and reddish turquoise color

314
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Yellow nose ring

315
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Just

316
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Spectacular

317
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
They could see active volcanoes on one of the moons of Jupiter

318
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,895
Finally that vision of Neptune like a blue juul

319
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Really blue

320
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
It's all

321
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Came from voyage

322
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
We have no idea how they look like

323
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Neptune was the last

324
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
Big cool planet and it was the last thing they were

325
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Photograph

326
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
After that the camels were going to be shut off

327
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
To save energy

328
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
But

329
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Carl Sagan convince them

330
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Turn on Voyager back door

331
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
And take a final picture

332
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
So on Valentine's Day 1990

333
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
One of the ships

334
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Luly Rocha

335
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
It's it was facing back

336
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Earth

337
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
It snapped a picture

338
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
One last picture

339
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Describe

340
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
So

341
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
It's

342
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Mostly empty

343
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
It's

344
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Pretty dark

345
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
You can see certain streaks of light

346
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Coming from the Sun

347
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
And then

348
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,471
You honestly wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out to you but down in one corner

349
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,103
Kind of a suspended in a Sunbeam the ways of very small. Blue

350
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Pale blue dot

351
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
That was us

352
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
In Carl Sagan's words

353
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
Everyone you ever knew everyone you ever loved

354
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Every superstar

355
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,135
Every corrupt politician

356
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,535
Everyone in all of history everything the sum total think of the river

357
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
So that one indistinguishable group could

358
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,775
Have momentary domination over

359
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,383
Fraction of that Pixel It was one of those really rare

360
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,271
Images every single day I'm here from people who take that pale blue dot

361
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
So deeply to Heart

362
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
What to do with a complete reframing

363
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
After that

364
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
The, what sound off

365
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
But here's the thing

366
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Bishop's kept going

367
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Drifting through the darkness

368
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,871
Even though they weren't taking pictures anymore they were using like their other senses little instruments that

369
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Text like how many particles are around what the temperature is so they were hurtling through this empty space really fast

370
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Measuring

371
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Sending that data back

372
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
And scientists like that off with their listening

373
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
For what

374
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,047
Was not clear but they knew at some point these capsules would get to the edge

375
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,119
The edge of what the solar system

376
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
The solar system has a big spider has an edge it's a it's like a bubble

377
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Sean has a wind every start of the wind but the sun has its own wind

378
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
It blows out through the solar system can be between 402

379
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
All the planets and

380
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
Keeps everything else out

381
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,911
So these little things are cruising out towards the

382
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,751
Edge wherever it is scientist don't quite know where it is or what it is

383
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
Because the control room or like Panama shift like hey what's

384
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
What's up what do you see

385
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Nothing

386
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
How about now

387
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Not much

388
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
How long before the X

389
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
14 years

390
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Oh man that's like driving

391
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Kansas

392
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
But like a million times worse.

393
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
There Comes a Day end of 2004

394
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Where

395
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,143
They stop listening for a little while because the antenna and that's only has so many antennas Matthews into listen to everything

396
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
So for a little while the boys are teams like okay you guys over there can use the antennas we're going to lunch

397
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,663
It's been 14 God damn near knocked yourself out at school

398
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
And they come back few hours later start listening again

399
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
And

400
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,208
Happened very sudden everything is totally changed all of a sudden boom speed of the wind

401
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
Drop them around 380 count to a hundred

402
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,472
Instantly I just all-in-ones density and then everything out there started to get

403
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,848
Poland

404
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
And before

405
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Articles also behaving a very different way

406
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,136
And the fields are very

407
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
We are

408
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
The fields and magnetic field

409
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:59,936
So just like the sun has a wind system has a magnetic field as well the field starts at the Sun and then curves out in this

410
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,544
Kind of graceful Arc through the solar system rotates

411
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
Create what people called by levinas

412
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Cart

413
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,712
You know how like a skirt with a flare if you spin around real fast that's

414
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Apparently kind of what this

415
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Field looks like

416
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Way out there

417
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
It seemed like a skirt

418
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Started

419
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Freddy

420
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Maybe tear a little

421
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Threads

422
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,536
Broken often seem to be floating around on their own not connected to anything

423
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
So

424
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
What is this song

425
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Fields are breaking down in

426
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
The wind is dying down inside the wind is what exit

427
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Create the space solar system

428
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
This mean we're out to know

429
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
I kind of thought that was always happy

430
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
But no

431
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
It's not out

432
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
And it's not

433
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Quite in

434
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
It's in the

435
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Edge of the bubble

436
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,416
India but it's not like

437
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
It's a thick

438
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,768
The catch the edge isn't just a little line that you cross

439
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Place

440
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400
And while we listen to the to Voyager ships moved through this Edge

441
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
For several years

442
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:13,408
Then something very interesting happen that the wind on which one

443
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Stop

444
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Lie completely stopped

445
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Yeah

446
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
So now we're out no no

447
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
I mean this is what people thought

448
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,512
But the other measurements like temperature and number of particles

449
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Text field doesn't tell us

450
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
Nature surprise.

451
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Again

452
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
So now we think there's a place at the edge of our solar

453
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Customized at the edge

454
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Shove the edge

455
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
Utterly still no wind at all

456
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Pause

457
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
People Akinator

458
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Stagnation layer

459
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,784
And there is a big discussion why this layer exists

460
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
And housing

461
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
And by how thick it is she means

462
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
When will it end

463
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Because

464
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Once we get past this so is anything ever crossed

465
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
The Foundry Buffet

466
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
No this will be the

467
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
First man-made object

468
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
To leave

469
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Any Star

470
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
And the voyage was like right there smiling touching that Bounder

471
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
You know you only do those things

472
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
First one

473
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Like your first

474
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
Your first taste of alcohol

475
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
Your first time driving a car

476
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
First time you see the ocean

477
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Open up a whole new world

478
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Going to freaking app

479
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:38,400
It might have happened while we were talking that was thinking from now any moment now next

480
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Capital Moses

481
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Or 3 years from now

482
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
It's closed

483
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,128
Everyday open my Google alert for Voyager and I look and see

484
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,736
Did happen today before the show goes out of me pissed yeah everyday

485
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
The first thing you do in the morning

486
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Like the Thursday

487
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
He left that story at that point five years ago it seemed like the Voyager probes were in this

488
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Weird

489
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Liminal space

490
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Kind of stuck somewhere in the edge

491
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Of the edge

492
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,640
Of our planetary neighborhood

493
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Transition moment

494
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Could happen at any time that's where we left it

495
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
Which seemed honestly kind of frustrating like we did the story too soon

496
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
You know what that happens every so often

497
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
So we decided to call merav opher back

498
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,024
She's a scientist you were in the story who is part of the Voyager team

499
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
To pick up the story like what happened

500
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,472
Okay so since then we will waiting right and his stories is

501
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,032
Fascinating and a little complicated to

502
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Because this was back

503
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
In 2012

504
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,224
Right Jesus shortly after our story was released couple of months later

505
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,576
So was in August on August 2012 but six months after

506
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
Name

507
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Particles this was

508
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
Fascinating the energetic particles

509
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
From the Sun

510
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Dropped

511
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
Some people thought out no sun particles that must mean we're out

512
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Couple of days later they came back

513
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,984
And then there was the same test as before

514
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
And then they dropped again

515
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,616
It's almost failed that somebody had to open a window

516
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,016
And I close a window and then open a window and window so was kind of weird

517
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
Spectre classic Crossing

518
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
It should be sudden it should be all you're in or you're out you don't have this intermediate

519
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
I mean I'm out that mean I'm out I saw so this was not the classic textbook and was very

520
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Women like Ayo what's going on

521
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,728
And there was very heated discussions because

522
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,848
You know you're waiting to say to the public are we really cross the solar system for the first time or not

523
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
And we can Jose

524
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,248
Super frustrating scientist started arguing

525
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,880
Me there's a bunch of conferences and meetings where they got together and the scientist essentially broke into faction

526
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
One faction

527
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
It was like we are out

528
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Another faction was like no

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Where in

530
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
And she says it one of those meetings

531
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
There was a vote are we in or are we out and and I and I just felt this is crazy this is such a mess

532
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Major

533
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,384
My stone exactly

534
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,944
Did we really arrived to America's evolved

535
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,064
And it was just crazy they did vote and the vote

536
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Was still well inside

537
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
So towards the end of 2012 that's what they thought we're still in

538
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
But

539
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,864
Something change and and the something is a sound we were hearing

540
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
Around the time these arguments the Voyager with sending back

541
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
Sound doesn't have a lot of energy on board

542
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
So they have a tape recorder

543
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
Soon as a tape recorder

544
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Really yes

545
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
I think it's a 8-track

546
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Janus Inc

547
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
It turns out it's true that there are eight tracks on both of the probes

548
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,720
They're capturing ultra-low frequency plasma

549
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
223 kilos

550
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
But you can actually hear

551
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Now that whoosh

552
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,240
That is just a background of the power supplier of the Voyager itself idling basic

553
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
Cruising through empty space

554
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
But she says when you go to the following recording

555
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,432
This what you're about to hear is 8 months of time

556
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
From late 2012 into 2013 8 months

557
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
Collapse into a tiny clip

558
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
What you hear are these little swells

559
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
There's one

560
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
You have

561
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
Those ramps

562
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,544
Leavittsburg it's kind of confusing the Ascension Rob says those swells

563
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,360
That's the Voyager spacecraft

564
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,176
Colliding with some new

565
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
Galactic stuff

566
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
So you're hearing

567
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,624
It was a ramp of density as you go into Interstellar space

568
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
I thought that those sounds one of those two sounds

569
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,840
Is the Voyager bursting out of our solar system but she told me no no

570
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
What it is

571
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
What is the sound of the Voyager already on the other side

572
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
The boys are basically saying I'm in a new space now

573
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,848
After some analysis in this part I cannot explain

574
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,432
NASA pinpointed the ejection moment

575
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Crossover moment

576
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
To just

577
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Before

578
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
The first of those two swells

579
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Took this is the first well

580
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Just before that

581
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Right there

582
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Migrate

583
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
That's when we left

584
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
It's so undramatic

585
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:04,032
But we finally escaped

586
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,640
Official exit date 25th of August of 2012

587
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,808
Always ready to talk to you

588
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:22,208
The sunbeams ride Helena

589
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
So now we have a

590
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Human manufacturer

591
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
That has left

592
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
The sphere of the Sun

593
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
On the other side in the other ocean

594
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Is like I am

595
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,688
I don't know it's a Bittersweet till to see all this incredible data

596
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
That Voyager is giving us

597
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,624
And I want more I would like another mission there. Looks like somebody to give you like a taste

598
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Look how interesting this day that he's in poop

599
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
They're leaving

600
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,864
Speaking of leaving merab says that we can expect to communicate with the Voyager probes for

601
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Another age 10 years but then

602
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Eventually they will lose power

603
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Endodontic

604
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Recording

605
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
What time is it 11:33

606
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm already getting close

607
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
30 seconds

608
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,512
Turning on

Ariel mermaid

610
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,312
Look look up with the Sun

611
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,744
Is Big Black.

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,304
In the middle of the sky was white

613
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
Halos coming from it oh my goodness

614
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,504
Look at the stars bag

615
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Is Venus there's a parade and then there's a

616
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
It's so pretty

617
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
So pretty

618
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:57,600
