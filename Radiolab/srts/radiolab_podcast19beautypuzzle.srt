1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Who's iPad is this

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
But it was mine

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
Oh my gosh best for your handwriting

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,160
Your handwriting is not awful it's actually very elegant

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
Is it legible not so much

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
But elegant

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,632
Generous Radiolab so not too long ago Robert and our producer Bethel habte has a nice lean-to

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,960
To it pulled me into the studio to walk me through this

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
Story that they've been working on together for

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
Everybody

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
Yes so what are you doing

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,016
You guys are just going to tell me the story or could rather tell you a riddle okay

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,112
Once Upon a Time Birds evolve

16
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
They evolve from dinosaurs

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,744
So they was originally scary things in the scales turn to feathers in the

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,816
Feathery things began to fly we call those things Birds

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,448
But they haven't lately I just I'm going to just ask this to you out of the blue because it's a basic appendage

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
How many birds

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Have

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Penis

23
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,360
Oh oh oh can I buy before you answer

24
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
There are like 10 to 20 thousand different kinds of birds button by modern time

25
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
So again how many of those

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Have penis

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:33,696
At what percentage of currently existing bird bird species have in the mail

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,840
With the penises as we would identify like a hangout

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,448
Is it making weird penis

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Zolman Tire

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
Do you know how many times we said penises are there in 27 and 4 minutes

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Birds have penis

33
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Well

34
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
I have

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
Absolutely no frame of reference answer this question I don't know I mean

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
30

37
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Lower

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Dead

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
10 lower

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
5

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Lower

42
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
One three

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
3

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
3%

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Yeah 97% of birds

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Don't have penis

47
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
Wow yeah

48
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,248
So we learned this little fact from a scientist named Patty Brennan

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,344
So weird about birds is precisely the fact that they they lost a penis

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Will you just said

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,976
You just use an interesting. So that you say the birds lost the penis is so does that mean that

52
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
Earlier editions of birds it have them

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,656
That's right yes of penises are widespread traits of old

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Vertebrates right except for you know some amphibians

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
And fish

56
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,104
And according to Patty if you go back 200 million years or so

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Birds were like all those other creature

58
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,040
Yeah like basically 100% of them had penises sexy right over time

59
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
Vast majority of birds apenas was then lost

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Now

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
Well that's the question how do you lose a penis like

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
It seems like a pretty handy thing to have when you want to put your sperm close to female eggs to the 97%

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
Don't have a penis now what do they have David kind of hold the mail and the females have these holes in the shirt

64
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
Open up anime line them up yeah it's called a cloaca

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Play Commander MTG and that's it that's it and it works just fine but if you're thinking about the engineering what appendages

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Is going to work best for you to make babies

67
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,512
Penis is the one because it gets your sperm closer to female eggs

68
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
So far all of these penises to just vanish like she says that evolutionarily that just doesn't make any

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Acquired you lose a thing

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
What's so useful for there to be selection for the penis to to go away

71
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
There's going to be a very important reason

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
What's the reason

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Well there's a few possibilities

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,088
Number one people have speculated for example that you might have been sexually transmitted diseases

75
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
You're putting this Pinos way deep into the female and then you're pulling your penis back into your click I like that could be potentially

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
Easy Exchange of of sexually transmitted

77
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,007
Cuz you're like digging the germs deeper I guess exactly yeah yeah yeah so even though the penis has its advantages obviously

78
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,407
Maybe it's only one way because the birds that had the penises just kept getting these inspections that's

79
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
But so far nobody's found a link between penises and STDs so then the other possibility that's really intriguing actually

80
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
Is the babies because

81
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Penises are heavy

82
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Number to start flying

83
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,631
And getting rid of the penos would have been an easy thing for lowering your body weight

84
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
Maybe they lost him so they could fly further items

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
I mean I think that's

86
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
Unlikely to have Phoenix strong enough selection

87
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,199
Because ducks for example are among the most long-distance migrants

88
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,575
And they still have penises Theron to 3% and sometimes they have penises that are bigger than

89
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Theron body

90
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
So

91
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Patriots to my god you watch a penis go by with wings

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
Oh my God yes I think the record is a male that had a 43c

93
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Centimeter long penis

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
And this is a male that was only about 40 centimeters long himself

95
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
So apparently you going to be pretty large penis and fly just

96
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
The Ducks are also sort of the key to a third Theory

97
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
Pretty disappearance of the penis so yeah so I was going to say my favorite

98
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,903
This is some this idea that actually had to do with female choice

99
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Against

100
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Males that controls Ripper.

101
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
To explain Patty actually thinks that the original bird penises

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
Might have been a lot like the modern-day

103
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Duck penis

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
Which is essentially

105
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
A weapon

106
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
I'm so one of the things that we learned when we were studying the Ducks is that

107
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Do males have a bolt Direction mechanism that is

108
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Crazy they have Annex

109
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
Close his erection mechanism

110
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,511
What that means is that the male actually efforts his penis and ejaculates in a third of a cell

111
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
Basically a a a pistol

112
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,423
Penis looking mushroom yeah it just goes between yes

113
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
Wow what what does though is that it allows these males

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,151
To forcefully inseminate females even when females don't want to be inseminated right safety smell

115
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,759
Is anywhere near a female is just going to go and push right through

116
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
And so as you can imagine that's not

117
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
You know

118
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
That's not something you Starley desirable for female

119
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Often times with females will be

120
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Struggling

121
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
They're trying to get away from these

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
Emails that are trying to forcibly copulate

123
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,751
So Patty thinks that will might have happened here is that female Birds trying to get away from males with

124
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Large penises and

125
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
He's really violent ways of

126
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
Approaching reproduction

127
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
Begin systematically choosing gentler and smaller males with smaller penises right so so if females

128
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Closest are selecting males that are less

129
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
Violently sexually violent did that my

130
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Lead to the disappearance

131
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
But I think you just said is

132
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Overtime because the ladies were

133
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
The ladies were just comforted

134
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
The gentleman

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Changed

136
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
And lost their penis

137
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
You got it

138
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
She think that that's females essentially castrated males well is a slower process

139
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
Castration / time

140
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Yes I suppose

141
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
Now what meme

142
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
What makes you what what evidence is there for such a thing

143
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
So no I mean

144
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
Norman in a way because we're talking about penises which are soft tissue

145
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
And they don't fossilize so even if we went back into the fossil record

146
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
It would be really hard to fight

147
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Find evidence of Wadsworth have

148
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,151
So that's the part that is difficult you know it's kind of like a wonderful story

149
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,039
That that I think makes a lot of sense given what we know about the way these penises work now

150
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
We can only

151
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Speculate

152
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
I like this idea

153
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
But is this just a one-off I mean

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,303
What about Gorillas in Moose who fighting

155
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,911
Clash their horns I mean there's so many species where it just seems like the females have zero choice

156
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
So I know they there are a lot of cases like that of bedbugs are especially horrifying Google it

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Talk about bed bugs but

158
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
There are actually a lot of cases where

159
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
When the females do get to choose

160
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
Bape shoes in ways that

161
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Completely change

162
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,903
What we see in nature are we found a group of scientist who now are

163
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,791
Cute but if you look around nature you will see females driving evolution in ways that I certainly didn't expect

164
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
And when they get into the details of how this actually works I think it's going to

165
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
Flip your ideas about evolution

166
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
In a way that you are totally unprepared for

167
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,615
Do they have evidence for this idea cuz I got to say to you haven't yet convinced me of the first thing they said

168
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
That females have

169
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Evolve the penises away

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
I guess that was a guess

171
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,111
I will introduce you to a bird called a bowerbird

172
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
That I think will spell it speaks for itself in these regards

173
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
And it's also his penis list

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
They're really

175
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
They have

176
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
Beautiful plumage the satin bowerbird is a

177
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
Beautiful iridescent blue with a

178
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
Violet blue eyes this is Gail Gail patricelli and I'm a professor of evolution at a and ecology at

179
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
UC Davis

180
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
Well I say that again without stuttering on and

181
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
No no

182
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Anyway so the Bower birds what makes them

183
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
Most amazing is that they build

184
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Bowers

185
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
So about our

186
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Listings of birds

187
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Build

188
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Basically a structure made out of

189
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
Text which can be up to 3 feet tall and it repeats

190
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Loving it in some of these things now

191
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Yeah and

192
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
It looks like an s

193
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,335
But it's really a kind of Seduction theater with one seat

194
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,223
And that nms for her this is Richard from of Yale University sat biology

195
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Is there any system on and around this bow

196
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
The mail will a real whole bunch of

197
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Down.

198
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Precious objects

199
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Beautiful

200
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
Parrot feathers and berries and flowers and leaves stuff that the bird gathers from the forest episode East

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,703
Structures can be very ornamented and elaborate every species has its own

202
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Style and some species of all be blue everything

203
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Blue feathers

204
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
Blue flowers and then of course blue trash like drinking straws and bottle caps

205
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
In the mail by bird

206
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
Basically dedicate this whole life learning how to build these structures

207
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
What take the satin bowerbird they take 7 years before they reach sexual maturity and during that. Of time they look

208
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Just like females

209
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
An elephant fly around the valley and get

210
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Courted by adult males

211
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
So they play the role of the female

212
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
And learn how courtship works from other males

213
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
In the valley and then when they get a little older that's teenagers

214
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
All-Star building practice

215
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,247
Court each other and eventually once about a bird figures out how to make a really good stuff

216
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Female has arrived

217
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,047
SLL fly down to the bower and now often check out the bower itself

218
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
Symmetrical like a well-built

219
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
And if she likes what she sees

220
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Slender the Bower

221
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
This is where things get interesting

222
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,615
Because the bower has a very particular

223
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:05,503
Purposeful architecture

224
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,063
So it's two parallel walls

225
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Styx

226
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
It better close to one another

227
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
And the female sits between them

228
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
Three different variations on the basic design but in all cases the female is in a protector

229
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Did position

230
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
There's always some kind of barrier or wall between her and the mail so the male wants to try

231
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Try to force himself on her for whatever reason

232
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
He has to run around the back and she can just fly away out the front

233
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
Even as he's trying to win her attention completely he's built a building that keeps her out of disk

234
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
Absolutely the bower is like

235
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Insurance against date rape

236
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
For the female

237
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,375
It allows the female to observe him at an intimate close distance for as long as she likes

238
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
While still maintaining our freedom of choice

239
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
So the female if she likes

240
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
The Bower

241
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
So settle into this protected space

242
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Where she can back out whenever she likes

243
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
And then time to begin the show

244
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
So he'll start out with his own

245
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
His own displays many of them

246
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Very loud electronic sound sounds

247
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,959
They do they do imitations of kookaburra

248
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Cockatoos

249
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Then along singing

250
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,711
Didn't they pop up on a run vigorously back and forth right in front of

251
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,039
The female and she's standing between the walls of the

252
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
So the female watches all this from her seat

253
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,927
Spot for as long as she likes and she can decide

254
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
She would like

255
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
To meet with this guy or

256
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Not good enough

257
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Stop and fly away

258
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
For the female

259
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
The moment

260
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Pisco

261
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
That was particularly interesting here is a gale has done studies

262
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
You said show

263
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Windmill

264
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,247
A very close attention to the female like when the male really watches her body position

265
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
The way that she's like pastured that can actually signal whether she's interested or not the males that respond to most of those signals are

266
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
Are the most successful in mating

267
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,535
In other words if the male makes his move too early and too aggressively

268
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
She's gone

269
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
And that mail doesn't have any babies

270
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
But it also seems like the females are

271
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,287
Have toying with the males like seeing what they're willing to

272
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Do for them like

273
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
If you if you watch a video of this

274
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,711
You can see in one bowerbird

275
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
She comes in he like

276
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
A list of his wing with

277
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,159
Kate and then just like sort of rotates his wing like this like

278
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,791
It's so funny like a like a like a like a matador and then

279
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Right after that

280
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
She like

281
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Picks up

282
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
A blueberry

283
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
From the ground

284
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Henan

285
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,079
She drops the blueberry and then he does the Matador thing with the blueberry in his mouth

286
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,343
Good vibe

287
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Seems to be all about her

288
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
May I see what you mean

289
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
Yeah I did females are definitely driving driving the bus

290
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:41,823
And when you start to really think about the implications of this about it being all about her

291
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,199
That can lead you to a fairly deep rethink of the very basic rules of how evolution

292
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Really

293
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,647
Normally the classical argument with credit like the reason this male bird is so color

294
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
Apple so red or whatever

295
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
The reason the peacock has the gigantic and

296
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
Beautiful feathers on its tail

297
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Is sort of a signal

298
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,703
That the mail is sending to the female of Fitness look at me

299
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,799
I am healthy to have a tail like this I don't have parasites I'm strong

300
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
I be a great mate

301
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Play survival of the fittest

302
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,991
Right but let me ask you if you just heard about bird story you have these females with these

303
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Ouija

304
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
He's like this one

305
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Likes

306
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Gulou

307
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Only blue

308
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
And this one likes iridescent shells

309
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
So it shall sell sell sell sell than this one likes green leave but they have to be right side up and never ripen upside down

310
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Fitness signals or is this more like

311
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Art

312
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
Maybe she just likes

313
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Blue

314
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Or she just

315
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Likes

316
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Shell

317
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
What you're saying that

318
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,039
These birds evolve based on on whims and tastes well or Rick

319
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
And there's other

320
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
Smells like him save absolutely yes it's about beauty I'm really focusing in on aesthetic

321
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Choices

322
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
Choices that are based on what it is the animal likes

323
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Where's at the whole darwinian

324
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Thought

325
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Was

326
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,591
Will you okay there might be Beauty there but on some level the logic behind those beautiful

327
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Things is

328
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
Survival survival of the fittest that does not sound very darwinian

329
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,807
Well since you dropped the name I propose at my view is

330
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,135
The legitimately authentically Darwin interview

331
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Darn he had an idea about beauty

332
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,535
Oh yeah he he actually

333
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Okay

334
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Page 397

335
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Descent of Man

336
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Stripes and marks

337
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
And ornamental appendages have

338
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Alban indirectly gained through the influence of

339
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Love love

340
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Jealousy

341
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Through the appreciation of the beautiful

342
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
Enter the exertion of a choice

343
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
How interesting

344
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
So you saying

345
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
That is love jealousy and beauty

346
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Choice

347
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Yeah Android

348
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
Yeah that's definitely not what I learned

349
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
So it's

350
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Over a hundred thirty years later and I'm still pissed

351
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
You think there was some kind of plot

352
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
To reduce

353
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Darwin's idea into

354
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Does something smaller

355
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
And eventually

356
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Eliminated in tire

357
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
I would like to go historical let's go out with Darwin

358
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Let's go Wallace said

359
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
And then let's go

360
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Did the 20th century and where we got so screwed up

361
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,111
Charles Darwin spent 20 years working on his theory of natural selection

362
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
He was not particularly noisy about it

363
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Because you knew it would

364
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Very much

365
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Disturb his wife was quite religious and other people in his church so during the twenty years while Darwin was working away

366
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
This other guy comes on

367
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
His name is Alfred Russel Wallace

368
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:57,919
Kind of skinny in scrapy and self-taught 14 years younger than Charles Darwin

369
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,015
Went around the world collecting specimens and he also

370
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
Came up with a theory of natural selection

371
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Independent

372
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
What was the relationship

373
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,511
To each other I mean today where they friends were they collaborators were they

374
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
Hope you know they were

375
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Close

376
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
Collaborators first they kind of both got credit

377
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
For the idea

378
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
But

379
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,567
A little later Darwin rocket it out his book into interpress

380
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,871
What he publishes On the Origin of Species

381
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:33,247
Very popular book Darwin got the Lion's Share of the credit as I think rightly so

382
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
Has he been working on the idea for literally for decades

383
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
In 20 years later Darwin dies

384
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,975
Meanwhile Wallace lived in until the dawn of War

385
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
I drink if I'm this is Rick's argument after Darwin die

386
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Wallace kept saying over and over and over again

387
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,935
Then when it came to female Choice animals

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
I didn't have the sensory and cognitive capacity to make aesthetic judgments and nature so these is love

389
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Amber decorations and be artistic

390
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
Behaviors can only evolve if it communicates

391
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Information about

392
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Vigor

393
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
Quality and general fitness to survive

394
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,463
And Rick would say that because Darwin wasn't around to argue back

395
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Wallace may have lost

396
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
The the battle

397
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Over

398
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Credit

399
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
For the

400
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
Discovery of adaptation by natural selection

401
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,519
What do you want the war over what evolutionary biology would become in the 20 Century

402
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
We have inherited both the science and the culture of flattened dumbed-down and ideologically purify

403
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
White version of Darwin's

404
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Actual richest

405
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Fighting words

406
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
About UC Rick is pretty fired up about

407
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
This and he's written a book

408
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Evolution of beauty

409
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Where he argues that ever since Alfred Russel Wallace scientist have been trying to squeeze everything

410
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,423
AC in these male patterns male dancers male songs male blue images

411
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
It was single explanation

412
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
Can a dogmatic category

413
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
Cult Fitness net female choice they claim is always

414
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Always about Fitness Bethesda

415
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
Erica is now you know that is

416
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
That's a stretch

417
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
Is no way to boil down all this variety Into Fitness

418
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
I'm not saying that the emperor wears no clothes

419
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm saying that the emperor

420
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Is wearing a loincloth

421
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
What I mean by that is that that humble garment

422
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
Covers about the same percentage of the human body

423
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
As the idea of a adaptive mate choice

424
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
Covers all the ornaments

425
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,104
Sexual ornaments in the world what you just said is that most

426
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,248
Or most of what you see most of what you see in the world you think is

427
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
Who is desire

428
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:48,928
The desire between creatures expressed in in beautiful for absolutely not

429
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Not that oh that

430
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
She's just looking at him thinking he's strong he's genetically

431
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
Trustworthy none of those just

432
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
I love him

433
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Yeah

434
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Yes it would he say most

435
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,032
Most of the time when you see the ornaments that

436
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
Not Fitness at all that's what he said most

437
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Is Big Time on most

438
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Why would you even

439
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,600
Know that I mean it as a human how would you ever even know the inner workings of another creatures mind

440
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:23,232
To know enough to say what it isn't this driving or not I got this very quiet I didn't know I asked a very question

441
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
$20 just came by

442
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
Right isn't it

443
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,376
Possible for you as a human being than any ID

444
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Dear what

445
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
A lady animal monster

446
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
To see in a guy if

447
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
That lady animal is

448
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
A peahen what you aren't

449
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Or

450
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
A trollop I'm ready to answer this I hope

451
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Here it is

452
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
I don't know what she wants now

453
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
But I know historically she's wanted exactly what you see in those males

454
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
The peahen has wanted that big ol tail

455
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
She's wanted the show

456
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
She's wanted the blue chest she has

457
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
At some time or another in the last

458
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
I don't know how many thousands of years

459
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,680
She has wanted everything you see on him from the Fancy Feathers

460
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
To the white skin around his eye to the

461
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
Iridescent blue the shaking

462
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
That's what she has wanted in the past

463
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
How do you do that

464
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Because it's there

465
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
Seriously what is a lawyer in the room

466
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,392
Where are biceps

467
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,744
Yeah so you just happened to have this like

468
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,792
Define nanostructured

469
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:36,192
Iridescent colors in your feather because like 42 interacting genes across five different chromosomes came to

470
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
Together to give you iridescent blue

471
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,824
The way you get iridescent blue says Kim is you start small

472
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
You give your female a bunch of choices which are the males

473
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
Interblock so imagine the female bird surrounded by a bunch of males who are all just boring or gray or black or what

474
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Whatever then totally randomly

475
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Email servers up

476
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Who just happens to have

477
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
A little bit of blue on them

478
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
And she noticed

479
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,608
When the sun glints off of his black plumage there's just a little answer blue in that black

480
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
Glossy

481
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
Shiny blue black

482
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
I like that

483
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
I like that that

484
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
It's a little different than everybody else and I like it

485
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Who knows why

486
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
It could be totally random to

487
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,296
But for whatever reason she decides to meet with the blue guy I like that and because he's passing on his genes

488
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
Her sons are likely going to be a little bit blue to her offspring are going to have those beautiful jeans

489
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,304
And we already know that the females chose him because he was attractive and so she's going to have attractive

490
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
And her daughters are going to also find

491
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Those traits attractive

492
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
And so what you can

493
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,032
Our generations and generations of females you say

494
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,920
And then it goes you're you're creating your ear evolving the mail

495
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
To please the female end it all starts

496
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
With I like that

497
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
But I like that

498
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Doesn't feel to me

499
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,928
Opposite of Fitness like I like that could be

500
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
A desire that is

501
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Driven by in

502
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
And couldn't like the walls person walk in and be like

503
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
Yeah she likes that because she was designed to like that

504
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
She's not thinking about the

505
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
Did the why there she's just having a desire but behind that desire is

506
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,872
Maybe a drive to get her to leave mail that is the best

507
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,224
Like it could be the same with us too with people

508
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
Like what we find sexy

509
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Might have

510
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Maybe in the end of the bout Fitness that's a perfectly reason

511
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,352
Edible objection but what if I told you about an animal who has a fierce desire

512
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
SHOW beauty

513
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
And this particular desire for beauty is

514
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
So strong

515
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
That Fitness is

516
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Out of the picture

517
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
As a bird

518
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
It's another

519
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
Fix fries I know

520
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Take a break take a break

521
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
And afterward we'll come back with

522
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Third bird

523
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624

Technology

530
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
In the modern world

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

535

And I'm here because I need your help

536
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
And I request

537
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
For those of you who

538
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
We spend a lot of

539
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
What type of kits parents

540
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

541
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Tiny moment

542
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Brilliant

543
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Basically I want to hear about this

544
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
Did something

545
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
It just means you read back and say

546
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Well

547
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
How to make

548
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
Maybe it was the moment that I

549
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,496
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

550
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Do you

551
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

552
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,920
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

553
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Or maybe the kids in math class

554
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
You noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

555
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
We're interested in the

556
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Epic moments where

557
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
Kid does something super smart

558
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

559
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
If you have a story

560
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
T-shirt with us

561
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
Go to radiolab.org

562
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Flash brilliance

563
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
And record

564
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Short audio

565
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
And that's radiolab.org

566
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Flash brilliance

567
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Thank you so much

568
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,392
Dad Robert battle Radiolab we're back mid battle between

569
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Beauty and Fitness

570
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
Bird battle battle and introduce our third

571
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Bird

572
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Yeah you want me to go

573
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
So there's a bird out there called

574
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
The club winged Manakin

575
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
And this mannequin live

576
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
In the jungles of

577
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
I forgot where she was somewhere in the jungles

578
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
South America South America Colombia well okay so the the

579
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,856
The club winged Manakin has a very small range in Colombian Ecuador

580
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Is it big

581
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
Tiny Bird the males the Mills are mostly red bright red hair Auburn body

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
And black and white wings with little flecks

583
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,472
Pics of yellow underneath them boobies are small bird lots of color and female

584
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,104
Raise the babies on her own because she doesn't need guys except for the physical sexual act

585
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
He doesn't have to provide for her he just has to attract

586
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
So to that end

587
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
This is what are little red Romeo will do

588
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Hilton Sedona branch

589
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
In the Indian jungle

590
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
And he'll wait awhile

591
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Until females

592
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,192
And then when she does he has a courtship display and he

593
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
Bounces back and forth on The Purge

594
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,848
And while he's bouncing around every so often stops

595
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Boar's Head

596
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,456
Sticks his butt up in the air wings all position and Heat

597
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Rosa

598
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
Behind his back and then

599
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Vibrate

600
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
Shivers he Shivers his wings together so that the only things that touch

601
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,376
Are those feathers across the back the tips of those funny feathers are going knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock

602
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
They not 39 times in a row

603
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,008
It takes about a third of a second for those 39 Knox

604
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Their wings vibrate

605
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
So fast

606
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
But they make the sound

607
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,432
Can you make a can you make the sound

608
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,368
No it's impossible for humans to make with their voice

609
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,952
Is that serious

610
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
It's like a truck backing up

611
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
Exactly

612
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,632
So he's not using his voice that it's just as Wings kids got this instrument

613
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Yeah it's like it's

614
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
She called Street relation

615
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,592
So this is a cricket winged Manakin would be a perfectly good name for the spark

616
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,224
In any case something about that sound that specific

617
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Sound

618
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Excites the female

619
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,392
We don't know why but when it started but somewhere in the birds

620
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,256
Past a female decided she likes that sound and so the mail just started to make it

621
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
But here's the thing

622
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
In order to make that sound yeah they

623
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Really have paid

624
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
They have they have paid

625
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Because

626
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
To vibrate your wings that fast

627
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,920
107 times per second you need

628
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,248
A rigid Wing phone that you can really control

629
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,416
And so the club winged Manakin has done something unheard of

630
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,304
Their wingbonz went solid

631
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Just like a rock inside there

632
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
This is a big deal because

633
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Flying birds

634
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Have Halloween

635
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Actually can fly

636
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,312
Actually even Velociraptor and T-Rex

637
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
Chav Halo

638
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
So this is a feature that predates the origin of birds and the origin of

639
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
What this guy has given this up

640
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
In order to make

641
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
These

642
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
Extraordinary wingsong

643
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,184
What does not hurt your ability to fly vs

644
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Set yes

645
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
They are slow

646
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
Heavy

647
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,888
Unable to LEAP buildings in a single bound cost of doing business

648
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,728
A display right

649
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,056
Think about that you're in a crowded Forest

650
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,128
Lots of competitors. The Predators trying to eat you

651
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
And you've made yourself

652
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Slower

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
More vulnerable

654
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
And it gets worse

655
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Because

656
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Mannequins

657
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,648
How to start this process of building these hard bones really early

658
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,208
Like when they're very very tiny

659
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,048
In the embryo for the embryo has become either male or female

660
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
So you got an embryo that can go either way and they're already making the big bones and some of them are going to be mailed

661
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
But some of them are going to be female

662
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,336
So by choosing males with weird Wing Bones because they make great songs

663
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
The female also has daughters

664
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
With distorted

665
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
And inferior Wing Bar

666
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
That they will never use

667
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
Both the females and the males

668
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Skip these thick bones

669
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,464
So she is choosing to hear that sent

670
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
And has designed him to produce that

671
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
But

672
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
In the bargain

673
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
He comes out with heavier bonsai

674
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
I can fly last

675
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
And weirdly enough

676
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
She comes out with heavier bones

677
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
I can file EX

678
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
So both of them

679
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Are hurting

680
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Their chances

681
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Just survive

682
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
For the chance

683
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
I hear the beautiful tone

684
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
She wants to hear that he wants to give her

685
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Wait so

686
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
So she has every buns to

687
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
But she doesn't use them know Rick's Auto mediately like

688
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,768
I think all this is where the females got the bumps on her bones too and he's like

689
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Like what

690
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,520
I can females have it but they don't use it she's bearing the cost

691
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Of her own choices decadence

692
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
This is like

693
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:23,968
20 years ago

694
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:30,368
What did he mean so everybody in the population be

695
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,720
Becomes worse off because females are so choosy and shoes

696
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Beauty

697
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,632
So from Rick's point of view you got a contest going on here

698
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
Two Primal drives

699
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
And on the one hand there's the desire to survive

700
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
Survival of the fittest right

701
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
And according to that logic

702
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
The mannequin should go for the things that make him

703
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Swift and powerful and agile

704
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
But on the other hand lyrics

705
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
A second Drive

706
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Or in this case to hear something

707
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
They like

708
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Something Beautiful

709
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
And

710
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
In this case

711
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,816
That second Drive is so strong that it's winning

712
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
It's

713
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
It's pushing the birds

714
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Away from Fitness

715
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,544
So so we've gone we've gone through the math

716
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,920
And others have as well and there is nothing in theory nothing to prevent

717
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Discard process

718
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
From leading to Extinction

719
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
Oh my God

720
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,184
Right you just you just turned what I totally think of evolution on its head

721
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Like we've always been taught

722
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,632
That what these animals are doing is they're adopting as best as they can to new and changing conditions and

723
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Getting

724
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Better

725
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,264
But here you say that they are so

726
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
Hung up on desire and beauty that they even are going to get worse

727
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
Write what you know

728
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
That's why this example is

729
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,504
Checkmate but there are biologists

730
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
Eminently

731
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Hello

732
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,160
You want to be sucking a lollipop whatever you're doing it again

733
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,048
Like Jerry Queen of the University of Chicago

734
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
What is it is it a lollipop

735
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
Orange cough drops

736
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
So Jerry redrix book and there's not not convinced

737
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
By his acumen

738
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
Well I think it's a good book

739
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
But it's not a great book it's good because

740
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
It has really great

741
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:36,064
Stories about mating behavior which are accurate stories as far as I know and they're quite absorbent

742
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
Promise a good writer

743
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,488
The recent side great book is that it's tendentious that is as written to promote a Cause

744
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
Which is of course that males with

745
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
Beautiful ornaments are shaped by female sense of beauty

746
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Not Fitness

747
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
I think that the word Fitness is a huge problem

748
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
And I don't use it anymore

749
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,104
That you can't just say that and have it accepted by scientists unless you can test it

750
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
And that is

751
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,296
Ruggeri when it comes to the stories that we just heard like the bowerbird or the mannequin he thinks that more is going on

752
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
I'm here then what

753
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Richard says in his book

754
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,208
You know take the female bowerbirds preference for Bowers at keep her apart

755
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
From mail

756
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
I mean Richard

757
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Explanation that

758
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
It allows the female

759
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
More

760
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,240
Time to choose it doesn't freak her out because she feels protected that might be the right right explanation

761
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,080
But we don't know how many could be that females have an innate preference

762
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
It's for being sheltered

763
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Because it gives them a sense of

764
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Social Security

765
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
Like cats

766
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Cats like to beatbox

767
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
This right because

768
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
They feel sheltered and they feel safe and it could be that female bowerbirds

769
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
The same way

770
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
And that would lead to exactly the same situation but with a

771
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
Completely different explanation and it's not just

772
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
A random aesthetic

773
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,632
Or he says maybe some female bowerbirds like blue so much because

774
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Blueberries are really good for them and

775
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
Is there an 8 we drawn to blue because of

776
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
Or that let go to the American Tail

777
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
What that no 1500 Hearthstone Rick says that

778
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Simply Delights the female's butt

779
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Suppose that the females prefer males

780
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,736
They have a certain freak

781
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Seawing beating

782
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Because they were attuned to that frequency perhaps

783
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Because it indicates

784
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Something in their environment

785
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
It's useful to unlike the presence of a predator

786
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Could be anything really

787
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Sound of some romantic and friendly animal or the

788
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Protective animal maybe the

789
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:30,240
Although they were babies baby chicks and so they just have their nervous system innately tune

790
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Set frequency

791
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,056
See that's called sensory bias

792
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
Another theory

793
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,176
So they carry doesn't dispute the fact of female birds like

794
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Bowers

795
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
Or that they like

796
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Beautiful tone

797
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,136
He just think that there might be a reason behind their liking and that reason could include

798
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
Fitness

799
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:53,792
Correct but are you are you hoping I guess is that the right word hoping that there might be

800
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,936
A parasite signals involved here like you don't know you just want to know I don't know I mean that's my whole point

801
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,824
And that's why I don't think I don't propose my own theory of special selection I'm not sure which one is

802
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
Doesn't count for these mannequins with the heavy bones we just don't know

803
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Oh my God this can't just keep this conversation we're having keeps ending up in the same place which is we just don't know

804
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,440
The difference between me and Doctor promise I have been I don't know

805
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
The suggestion here is it Rick is clinging to a

806
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352
Faith in one explanation for

807
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Wallace it was Fitness

808
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
The Rickey

809
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
It's Beauty but still that

810
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,824
Dogmatic insistence I just think that adaptation by natural selection is is

811
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Pretty boring

812
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,712
You know we've been going to 150 years in week

813
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
Whip-whip that pony quite a bit and we made a whole bunch of progress but you know what there's this huge world

814
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Trinity in the static evolution

815
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Bet that has been missed

816
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
In fact Rick would say

817
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Of essential beauty is it can be

818
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
Many many different

819
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
It is

820
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
Gangnam beauty is fundamentally subjective

821
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
So the aesthetic model requires that we put the subjective experience desire itself at the center

822
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,040
Of our of our scientific explanation

823
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
But can you even have it a science

824
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
The basement

825
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Experience

826
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
IFixit

827
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Data science of subjective experience

828
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
It's not only

829
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
A good idea it's necessary

830
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
To understand the natural world

831
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Yeah

832
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
There is idiosyncrasy

833
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,384
Again ornithologist kimbap

834
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
You can't take the individuals out of it

835
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
So you don't

836
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
Is that science or is that just

837
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Okay it really comes down to

838
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,976
She's a Carp Lakes with that male carp has she the worm lights with the worm has she the bird like what the bird has

839
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:04,096
You have a trillion explanation each one different depending upon the lady didn't want to see you go

840
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
Where are you at that so-called Beauty and desire a category of an explanation as to not

841
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Tell you very much

842
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
That doesn't worry me at all

843
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,640
II doesn't worry me at all

844
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
You

845
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,272
All of us we are individuals we have unique

846
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
History

847
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
And life on this planet has a unique history

848
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,464
Science has a hard time dealing with unique instances

849
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
But biology is it just in your face with it

850
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
There are individual females making choices if that individual female had not made that choice history might have been.

851
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
Different in the species might look different

852
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
And that

853
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Is true

854
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
That's just

855
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
True

856
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
In in physics

857
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Conceit that but a scientist

858
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Supposed to do is take

859
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Clueless

860
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
Variety that you see in front of you and say look

861
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
I can boil this down to a rule

862
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Which is always true

863
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
Yeah we usually had one rule

864
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Everything

865
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,776
So what did John of science usually is this

866
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,848
Find some kind of Oneness inside the Menace

867
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
But now we've got

868
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
Nature and living thing

869
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
And they have this crazy spec

870
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Tacular variety

871
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,832
Now you've got a group of people who say you don't Maybe

872
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
We shouldn't even try

873
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
To explain all this

874
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
With one

875
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
Laurel or one

876
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Paradise

877
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
But you know I wonder

878
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
If

879
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
If that's

880
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Still science

881
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Or

882
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Or is it more like

883
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
History

884
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,663
What if every species or every animal

885
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
Comes with its own store in Century

886
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Once upon a time and then

887
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
Once Upon a Time

888
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Once

889
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
What time

890
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
Once Upon a Time

891
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Once upon

892
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Once Upon a Time

893
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
Once Upon a Time

894
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,935
Is this was reported by you have a crow witch

895
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
And Bethel hobday and Bethel

896
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031

Sure thing

899

African hyenas

901
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,807
We didn't mention the peacocks in the hyenas in which repeat that but we are very grateful

902
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Both of you

903
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Goodbye goodbye

904
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:13,279
