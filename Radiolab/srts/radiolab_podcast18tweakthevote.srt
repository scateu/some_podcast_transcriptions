19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Yeah so I was

Cambridge in mm

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
End

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
I love studying politics I was a history major so Joshua studying politics are you studying

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,104
Hit in the past so he was looking at you know going all the way back to the

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
Cradle of democracy in Ancient Greece and then

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
How democracy came to thrive around the world

31
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
But has he was studying that

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
He was noticing you know when the news you would see in certain countries like

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
France or Austria

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
You know there would be this

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Parties

36
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Far-right

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792
Ultra-nationalist anti-immigrant parties

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
That word

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
Starting again

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Traction

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
And for Yasha I saw some of this

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
This was a little bit

43
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
Because my family is being in the wrong place wrong time for bed for generation

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,384
His great-grandparents perished during the Holocaust my grandparents

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Betty survived

46
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
The Soviet Union map

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Hands clapping

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Poland

49
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
And was thrown out of the car

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Country Inn

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Anti-semitic wave 9

52
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
68th and South

53
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
The idea of a system the TV

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
Disabled Emoji piece for my son Newton

55
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Breakfast

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
And even violent

57
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,120
Do something but I suppose I always had symptom awareness off even as a kid

58
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
So I remember being quite worried by this and having friends were quite worried about it we were worried about it as

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
Is weed bad thing with going on

60
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
I didn't think we asked

61
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Deformed fat

62
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
These people might win

63
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,296
Jump to the early 2010s

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
8 * 20

65
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
For the first time Elena fan will have us

66
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Parliament

67
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Along with seven others from her far right

68
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
Party in France they start to gain

69
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Power and it is not just there but you swaps of Europe is also happening

70
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Elsewhere

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,776
Similar right wing party start rising up in Italy Greece

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,664
The Netherlands Poland Hungary and identity crisis for the entire European continent

73
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,504
And it's not just Europe you have India turkey

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
And what

75
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Started off as

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
United States

77
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Impossible is now real

78
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,000
Basically there's this wave of politicians whose message was

79
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
People and we listening to you

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
Your government has failed you

81
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Trust me

82
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
I would speak for people

83
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
I'm going to fix everything

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
And to Yasha this was

85
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
You know this is like a wake-up call

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
And not just because of

87
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,712
Immigration policy or right unless meanings of certain politicians

88
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,576
But even more deeply than that I was quite worried about the way in which these political movement

89
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Perhaps pretended to have

90
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
Some allegiance to democratic mechanisms

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
But actually we were enemies.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,072
Like there's this one guy the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party

93
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Glorified

94
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Besides rice

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Mission Valley Raceway

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Add Weehawken back to the country

97
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Fastest pass in a positive way

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
That wasn't

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
DePauw fat

100
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
I mean

101
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
A huge number of the world's dictators have penal exit

102
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Democratic

103
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
At some point

104
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
And then they move against Democratic institutions in such a way that

105
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Yukon displacement

106
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
So for yahshua who made this point was a lecture at Harvard he

107
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
You know kept seeing this and Country after country after country he saw these

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Citizens

109
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Willingly electees wannabe dictators into power

110
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
And so she started wondering

111
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
What is making the citizens do this

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,639
Do they do they feel like their current leaders don't get them do they

113
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:38,271
Are they already riled up about some issue of the day like refugees or income inequality

114
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Or

115
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Is this a sign that they're upset

116
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
About something even more Foundation

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
The prison system

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Itself

119
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Like are they actually angry

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
With democracy itself

121
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Anti sat down with

122
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
The friend and colleague

123
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,519
To figure it out and it's Brenda turns out worked on something called the world values

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Ambitious attempt to try and get a public

125
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Wikipedia around the world

126
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:09,247
Basically just a bunch of social scientist who asked a whole bunch of very standard questions

127
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
To a whole bunch of people all over the world

128
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
What's actually look scrutinize what

129
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
What's the setting hear about your mockery

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
And when we actually

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Look at the numbers

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
You're honestly flabbergasted

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Okay so

134
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Exactly three questions in particular

135
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
That he got interested in poker

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Start with

137
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
How do you feel about a strong ruler

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Who doesn't have to bother with

139
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Parliament

140
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
Who doesn't have to bother with Parliament or election

141
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Yep okay

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
They also asked this of Americans just instead of doesn't have to bother with

143
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
Parliament it was does not to bother with Congress

144
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
So in 1995

145
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
24% of all Americans

146
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Endorsed

147
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
That kind of strongman leader

148
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
24 / so you know one out of every four

149
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
Yeah but in the last several years that number is jump from 24

150
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
232 purse

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
So now it's a third almost

152
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
That sucks

153
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,295
Say it strong leader who doesn't have to deal with Congress or elections

154
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Is

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Either a very good or fairly good

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Well that's surprising

157
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,255
It's it's kind of even more striking in Europe so is it in Germany

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
One in six people

159
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,119
Used to like that idea but now I'm free

160
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Poor in Germany

161
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Where they

162
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
Should know better in France United Kingdom

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
It was one in for 20 years

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Is it go

165
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
And now it's 1 and 2

166
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Half

167
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
Yeah so every second written Frenchman's Asia

168
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
The idea of a strong ruler who doesn't have to Bubble Parliament elections

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Vest.

170
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,647
It's not appealing to me that is not appealing to me

171
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,255
Yeah who would say that they like the not be involved in a democracy

172
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Which is about being involved

173
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
Okay well if you think that's pretty here come question number two

174
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Flatout simple straightforward

175
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
How important is it to live in a democracy on a scale of 1 to 10

176
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
And when you look at

177
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
The Americans born in 1940

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
1940s

179
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Two-thirds of a give

180
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Baha'i Temple

181
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Living

182
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
We might be with

183
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
12232 Little Star

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
To make sure

185
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
But I'm wrong

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
American spoon since 1980

187
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
It's less than 1/3

188
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Less than 1/3

189
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Consider it essential to live in a democracy

190
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Less than 1/3

191
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
Stove a hundred people a hundred young people

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,103
3230 3025 it say I love democracy is very important arrest

193
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
What's a red state

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
It's not

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
It's not the most important thing for them

196
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Deciding where to live

197
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Okay well then if if you want if this is

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,135
Good where would you like to like what would you prefer

199
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,463
Would you like to be living that's a good Segway to the next

200
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Question final question

201
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Was about

202
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Emiru

203
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
So do you think would amirul is a good system of God

204
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
I'm evil

205
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
So we're not with this is no civilians anymore

206
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
Soldiers running the government still just following orders soldiers giving orders

207
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
So

208
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
20 years ago

209
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
About

210
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
1 + 6

211
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
16 Americans photos good system of government

212
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
In the most recent poll a couple of years ago

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
It was 1 and 6

214
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
Among young and affluent Americans

215
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Is actually

216
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Sedona from 6

217
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Send

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
235 bus

219
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
In America

220
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
What you got one in three

221
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
Young Apple in American Military was a wonderful thing

222
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
That's what you think

223
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Exact

224
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Yeah that's

225
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Misguided

226
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Or tragic

227
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,111
I don't know which said something he was like I didn't think of a cuddles to go there tomorrow

228
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
Once I can say this is wonderful but it does

229
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Show

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
A deep lack of attachment to a control system and visit of sense of

231
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
You know what

232
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
I mean try something

233
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
How backflip

234
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
You must watch the movie

235
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Here's the here's the thing that gets to be

236
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Let's imagine

237
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,735
A well-intentioned but totally authoritarian dictator

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Who takes over gets used to

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Power and then

240
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
As dictators do chooses

241
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Is to remain in place

242
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Forever

243
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
The adventure of democracy

244
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Is it admit

245
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
That nothing is ever right

246
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,351
We always have to fix it and the system

247
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Has built in it

248
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Impermanence

249
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Every

250
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
6 years you are

251
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,543
The senator over again every two years you will like

252
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
The congressman over again every 4 years you can have the option to switch presidents presidents can't serve Beyond a particular

253
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
It will be checked

254
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,295
They will be balanced as they will be protection but the whole thing

255
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Admit

256
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
But there's always change

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
And always the ability

258
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,047
And this trip that you just read me says we don't believe in it anymore that's dangerous to me

259
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,911
Scary to me I think my response is if that's the case and I don't argue

260
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Happy people happy zipping

261
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
If that's the case then let's fix it

262
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Let's not throw it out

263
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Let's repair it in some way

264
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
That's

265
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
But that's what seems like a moment like this called

266
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Basically you're saying

267
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Let's fix it

268
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Yeah

269
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
Yeah well

270
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Eminem is theirs

271
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,095
Corporate money and

272
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
Special interest lobbyist and gerrymandering and minority groups don't get a voice and active voter suppression in a lot of

273
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
Places the weirdest of the Electoral College to two-party system in general where it seems like they have nothing to do except for haitani

274
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Each other but the thing is

275
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
So just focusing like

276
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,623
I take this very specific week this week that we are talking about this there is a midterm election coming up

277
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
And so I figured let's like let's just focus on one thing

278
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Baoding

279
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Like is there a way to just

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Weakness

281
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
Fundamental part of democracy like can we change the way we vote

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Svet people don't

283
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Feel as many people now do that they're throwing their vote away that they did their vote doesn't count that their vote

284
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Is wasted

285
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Okay so

286
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
What would you

287
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
You suggest

288
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
So

289
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
What I got is a

290
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,719
Kind of an alternate universe it's it's

291
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
It's a different way of doing elections

292
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Vet

293
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Could have

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Founder effect on the way or tomorrow

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Eddie can you hear me

296
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Yes there we are good

297
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055
Okay cool and we're going to start off with producer Simon Adler

298
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
Yeah so in search of democratic inspiration

299
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
I called across the ocean to the Emerald Isle to talk to this

300
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
So my name is ABC open Bowman

301
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
Attorney work for orgy radio one on the DriveTime program is a radio producer reporter for Ireland

302
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Equivalent to the BBC known as RTE

303
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Eddie's a self-described election nerd

304
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Okay so

305
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Just wanna start from the start the way I would look at this is

306
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
American democracy is

307
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
One of the oldest democracies in the world it kind of like a laptop from 1985 at the time every

308
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
Everybody was like oh my God this is incredible it's so fast it's so responsive units so much stuff done with this

309
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
You did

310
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
But you've got to keep updating your operating system otherwise pretty soon your democracy is struggling to deal with things like

311
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
Facebook news feed on Twitter and leave the cell phones being hacked by Russia

312
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
In Ireland we got our democracy little bit later

313
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
The 1920s

314
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,655
Okay and I thought Point democracy had moved on from

315
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
The 1770s 1780s when you guys are boring your democracy

316
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
And we adopted this

317
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
What was the important modern voting system PRS TV

318
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
TV exact

319
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
It sounds a bit like an STD

320
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
It does sound quite like a sexual transmitted infection it does yes

321
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Other things like dead in the water

322
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:21,791
Canelo versus multi cprs TV that's really sounds like an STI it's not one more time

323
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Say it again multi-seat

324
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
PRS

325
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
TV stands for multi-season

326
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Portional representation

327
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
Buy single transferable vote

328
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
I have no idea what that mean

329
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
Weird as it might sound this is a system of voting.

330
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Unlock hours

331
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
I can make every voter feel hurt

332
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
Candidate to best reflect the collective interest of the people

333
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,487
And it make sure no one ever feels like they're throwing their vote away

334
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
You don't have you don't have to believe impossible feet

335
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
I'm walking to the lower part of Dublin Central

336
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Let's just put this in Concord

337
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Great

338
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
2016 there's an election

339
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
For the national parliament in the Dublin Central.

340
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Blocks

341
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Brick

342
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Row houses

343
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Punctuated by these

344
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
Brightly colored pink or purple or yellow doors you can think of it like an election districts in Ireland

345
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
It's what's known as it considers

346
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
Couple adult stores low-rise White

347
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Public housing unit

348
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Working class

349
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
Kitchen sink with a lot of difficulties this is Maureen O'Sullivan a longtime resident of the constituency with

350
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
Shock white hair anime always been involved with youth clubs

351
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Doing volunteer work

352
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
I've been teaching

353
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
In communities in the DC area

354
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
And so back in February 26th

355
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
This area of Dublin

356
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
Along with the rest of the country what was holding their parliamentary election

357
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Elections for what they called

358
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
TD

359
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
Wait water TDS

360
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,727
Right okay but Gigi is the Irish Gaelic for

361
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Chucky's daughter

362
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Which translates into remember Parliament

363
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,639
At that time Dublin Central had three of these TD seats

364
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Three people representative

365
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Parliament

366
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
One of them

367
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
I was elected in 2009 was Marie

368
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
And I would be I am

369
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Independent

370
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
Not allied with any party

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
And going in about 2016 election things were looking pretty uncertain for

372
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
A principal there was a field of 15 candidates running for the

373
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
And worse

374
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Seat 1 and 2

375
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,079
We're expecting to be snagged quite easily by these two high-profile major-party can

376
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
Yeah this again is a T-bone and who actually covered this 24

377
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
16 election

378
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
They're they're not locked down but these are people who look like they are going to get Alexa

379
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
What that means is you've got this wide-open field of folks all fighting against Marine for that third and five

380
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Who's are contenders

381
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
So we're going to focus in on two of them

382
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
Can I see a picture to introduce yourself

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Yes so I married

384
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
Fitzpatrick we got Mary Fitzpatrick

385
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
On the spectrum of American politics

386
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Do you know where you fall

387
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
You just a few parts

388
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
She's pretty liberal been around Irish politics

389
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
For while you interview me already

390
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
Secondary down hoody young community worker this Brash guy with red stubble on

391
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,023
His face quite interesting quote of hantik want to watch because he's representing this brand-new Politico

392
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
Floki outside Lincoln City, or anything like

393
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
Yes know what an amazing slogan it was very simple

394
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
And I was just the one word

395
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
If

396
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:53,759
Completely from fable about when the Macedonian army was marching

397
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
And defend Sparta a message saying that if we win we were born Sparta to Brown we will enslave your

398
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
Women and kill your children

399
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
What's 5% back one word message just saying

400
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
If

401
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Like I said

402
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,287
Brash and then you put other voices to her last winning or environmentalist or or others

403
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
All right things actually work over in Ireland

404
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Voting is underway in the Republic of Ireland

405
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
When does the country Alexa

406
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
257

407
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
New members

408
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
So day of the election comes

409
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
As a as in Irish

410
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,023
Citizen you walk into the voting booth and it's a very very long bowel

411
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Because it has all of the

412
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
All 15 of them

413
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
Their photo their name and then align

414
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
Okay it in this palette is a key component

415
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Of that updated Irish laptop of

416
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
Because instead of just feeling in the circle next to one of those two

417
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,735
15 you say my number one choice is this guy

418
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
My number two choices this lady my number three choices this person and you can go all the way down the ballast giving preferences

419
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
With many different people as you like

420
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
You write in a number next to eat

421
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
Each candidate about one man one vote

422
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
Well it's still one man one vote. Which can't you know it is it is it is it is

423
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
At the end of the day your vote will only have counted for one person

424
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
However in the voting process

425
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
What you're not just measuring what everyone's First Choice it looks

426
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
You might have a favor choice

427
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
But you're not totally equal but the other three choices

428
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
I'm with this system allows us to do is to reflect

429
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
It allows you to say how you feel about the rest of the

430
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
And

431
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
If your first choice doesn't make it

432
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
If he or she is way down the list

433
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Stand out of the running

434
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Then your boat lives on in the form of your second

435
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
So for as long as there's a viable candidate with your number on it

436
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Your vote will stay alive in the system

437
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
Is it is it too early for me to raise a

438
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,175
Off of winning Thursday when wait I may ignore it but let's see it or hear it

439
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
The commitment that people make

440
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Devoting

441
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
It's light

442
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Most of us

443
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Oriental lunch Sports

444
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Work I didn't

445
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,231
Baby on the day of a boat they have their best friend so you got to vote for Sally

446
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
Like they know one they they're not even in 07

447
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Yeah soap the first

448
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
It would take us more time than we want

449
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
And we might walk away from this exercise because we don't feel

450
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Pair

451
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
You can engage with this on whatever level you'd like Robert if you only know one candidate's name you can just put your one

452
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,063
Next to that person and hand in your ballot and you're done or let's say there's a candidate on there you really really don't like

453
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,391
You can please some of the Polish entirely your ranking

454
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Your preference

455
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
It's very simple

456
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Fairly good answer

457
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
So let me walk you through how this

458
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Polls close at

459
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887

February 26

461
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
And then

462
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Then all hell broke

463
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:01,919
General election 2016 on RTE Radio 1 with Rachel English and Schoenherr real action begins

464

Dublin Central Dublin Central get stranded in one central location which is b or d s that's

468
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,327
Vista to Ireland's largest Concentra trt

469
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Society

470
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Big vault

471
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Feeling big big hole

472
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943
Huge amount of noise

473
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
No I'm joking I see with the doors open

474
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
I arrived

475
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
This what's wrong arriving

476
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:50,559
It's now Mel monkeyboo the campaign worker for our endangered incumbent Maureen

477
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Sullivan

478
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,167
And on the morning of the count as he pushed his way through these

479
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Heavy wooden doors

480
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
We would have seen with the cavernous Hall filled with

481
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
People knowing about everybody's got clipboard this

482
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
People with twins

483
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Club sandwiches

484
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Is made

485
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
Tea and coffee in abundance and everybody's really excited

486
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Shortly after 9

487
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
All the boxes

488
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,135
Coming giant metal boxes of ballots to the boxes are open

489
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
Listen International

490
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,024
And there is a Cascade and a spelling of

491
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
All this paper because it's golden by paper voting

492
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Wait what

493
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Yeah

494
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
We tried electronic voting in this country and we didn't like it

495
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
Because it was very fast

496
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
And I think we realized that the dram of an election

497
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
And and also be

498
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,016
The ritual of democracy gets everybody engage and gets people watching

499
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
It's like watching a sport sports game you don't want to be up in 5 min

500
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Dara

501
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
And soap I'm now for our life update I have to warn as we always do at this time on this day we're talk

502
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Hawking tallies first of all which obviously can skew the results not just at the RDS and not just for Dublin Central but

503
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
All across the country both cancers are dumping boxes of boats and going through the prism of the stacks first

504
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Intercounty is Justin McCarthy new in no particular order

505
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,136
Play here and they include elderly on here the counters are just trying to get a handle on how many First Choice boats

506
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Each candidate is gay

507
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
I'm Calvin ultracarbon 100% of the boxes are open as well the ballot counters are doing this

508
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Initial count

509
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
There's another group of people standing next to them in their own unofficial

510
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Calculation

511
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
Yes definitely the tally man

512
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,576
There are several of them put forward by each candidate and they're just looking over the railing

513
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
Waiting for you to point of olive branch upstart Gary Gannon again today can cello name of the prison that got the number one

514
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
China number 1

515
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,776
What they're counting is number one yes they're shouting out in tallying the First Choice labeled on each ballot

516
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,872
So you haven't found them why they are at the races are not

517
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
Which it seems like Gary what

518
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
We have a 98% Holly are there is a growing belief here. The third seat will be between Kerrigan and getting a lot of birth prep

519
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
So I walked in a cup filled over but one of our national newspaper to do an interview

520
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,120
It's too early to be saying you over the line but you're going well until

521
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,520
All the radio researchers are coming over grab them and bring them over to speak on the radio if there's a bunch of you've done 9% as well so

522
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
And we could be in for another dogfight there Absolutely I'll cancel my weekend plans with ankle

523
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Real no sense of excitement

524
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Knox

525
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Forever

526
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,440
So that morning I was at home doing different things again this is incumbent Mourinho set

527
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,584

White fluffy and dog

529
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Dry brushing for walk

530
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Are you listening to the radio

531
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
You're totally disconnected pretty much

532
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
I left my

533
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Campaigners clover

534
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Vitaly

535
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Campaigners

536
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
It's starting to hurt

537
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Including Mouse

538
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,832
So what in what in the first hour from someone

You don't make me do not like Marius and isn't picking up

541
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
Enough votes

00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
Sao I hope this is not going to be an early day

543
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
Where does no need for you to hang around

544
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
Cuz nobody's in the rice any longer

545
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
And I'm then I think I was driving when I got the first call

546
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
From my

547
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,176
Campaigners over ended the country saying it's not looking good

548
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,808
Alexa let's go back to the busiest to Mary Wilson and the

549
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
Rachel thank you very much

550
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
The first count

551
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
Eminence We Believe here

552
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
In Dublin Central

553
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
Meanwhile the calories take all those ballots

554
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,328
Now officially started by first prep

555
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
And they pick up the stack

556
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
For each candidate on the table and then walk that stack back to its wooden shelving unit again

557
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,128
American Dad behind the table in the center

558
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
This giant sword

559
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Cubby

560
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Pigeonhole

561
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
Just like light flimsy wooden box

562
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,368
And this is the sacred Shrine of Irish democracy on this day

563
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
The cubby

564
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Absolutely

565
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Because

566
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Because

567
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,864
The first preference votes in the mall in their respective cubbies

568
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
There's a whole should not part of of the Arena

569
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
And

570
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
The returning officer stands up on a stage with a microphone

571
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
And goes

572
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Following is the result of chemical bond

573
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,200
Here is the first time for the constituency all double Central

574
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Steelcase

575
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,832
Six six and a readout of every candidate how many number one votes did they get

576
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
21

577
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
20 Honda first off the bar at the end of the first

578
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:11,328
First and second are pretty much locked down with the two people everybody expected to it

579
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
In third place

580
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
Unexpectedly is Mary Fitzpatrick

581
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
To be in third position on the

582
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
First time

583
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,568
Now with our system of voting at this point

584
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
You're done

585
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
The election's over

586
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,736
To Frontrunner candidates would have each won a seat and then Mary Fitzpatrick

587
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Wouldn't want to see

588
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Gary and Maureen baby out

589
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
Done but

590
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
In Ireland not so

591
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
In Ireland

592
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
They're just getting started

593
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
So back to the race

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
And remember at this moment

595
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,632
Mary Fitzpatrick is in 3rd Gary is in 5th and in 7th

596
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:50,240
At that stage I was listening to the radio and I knew what they were saying about Dublin Center

597
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Is incumbent Mourinho cell

598
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
And it appears almost certain to

599
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,736
Joe Costello and Maureen O'Sullivan are set to lose at

600
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
I had some

601
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:08,160
Because of the numbers I think the feeling was I was too far down that first preference

602
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
To come back

603
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,280
But I've been looking at the early results coming in from around the country like I said

604
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
It's not over yet so the way the most Progressive

605
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,888
The sheriff are the presiding officer

606
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
Start to eliminate

607
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
Candidate the first elimination

608
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Is the bottom three candidates

609
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
Those candidacies are gone and in the band

610
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
Since Gary's in fifth and Marines in 7th are safe

611
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
For now

612
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
But the bottom three candidates

613
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
They're gone

614
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:38,368
Y3 because they are so far out that mathematically they could never

615
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Come back

616
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
Between the three of them they've only got like a hundred fifty

617
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,280
So we get rid of all three of them and redistribute those

618
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
So if you voted for those people they just go okay

619
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
Who did you vote for as your second

620
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
And

621
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,264
The point is your vote is still alive and still part of the select

622
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Enso

623
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
150 votes

624
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
150 ballots

625
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,968
They begin to do this sort of ballet

626
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
Baluster Lindy's pigeonholes

627
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,160
Everything is visible vote counters walk back to that Shrine to that cubby and pulled the ballot

628
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
From the cubby hole for the

629
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
3 *

630
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,120
Then March this ballad back to it to the front table and sort them then into bundles of

631
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Second preference on the bottle

632
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
So now you've got

633
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
Stacks for every candidate that was listed as a second

634
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,128
And we distribute them they take them back to the Cubby where they are then added to the remaining candidates

635
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
First Pres

636
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Okay okay so what they want is

637
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,856
Everybody who voted to the degree that it is possible

638
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
Should maybe be participating in letting somebody to go out

639
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Exactly

640
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,584
Alright what time is it now we're probably middle of the afternoon at this

641
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
MLB start

642
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
We started at 9 in the morning

643
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,520
Point taken people are hacking by doing no no no no

644
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,336
I'm not watching this program for 5 hours

645
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:07,712
Is that a long time I will challenge your statement that just because a competition

646
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Unfold

647
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Slowly

648
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
That it is without

649
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Drama

650
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Or suspense

651
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
All right

652
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm sorry that we making this so hard for you

653
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,720
That's fine if you are not making it easy for us

654
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,840
Anyway back to the scene has reduced to three seats

655
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
So I'm looking at this going okay

656
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Mary Patrick Star candidate in 3rd after

657
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,496
The first count has 2500 votes

658
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,824
Gary Gannon / Liane V behind her

659
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,456
And my instinct is he's going to be more transfer friendly he's going to get more second choice votes than her

660
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
I think you could ever take her

661
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
Am I start watching where the transfer to going

662
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
And

663
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
I start to be proven rice

664
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,912
Knife pocket only getting two countries the whole process repeats knock somebody out to the ballet ballet redistribute

665
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Transfers Gary gulman pics of 60 votes

666
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,360
And I could possibly pick up stuff so he's gaining on her already to talk about me asking who is this going where is he going from

667
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
All these things and then look at my phone call Mary stock is falling well Gary their right is that Mary stuck is saying stop

668
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,600
You know we were struggling to transfer stuff that was the issue

669
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
And the others are gaining on

670
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
It painting

671
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
Undermined you still got other people taking up both their little pickups

672
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:33,216
Nautilus for moving ahead slowly

673
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,824
Hounds, you have for again

674
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
The time around really not much changes

675
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
Then come 5

676
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
The next person going I just got a hundred bucks

677
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
31 of them but Maddie Fitzpatrick but also 190 of them go to go to Gary Gannon

678
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,440
All the people in his ability to pick up transfers from

679
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Gary gulman

680
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
Jumped into fourth place

681
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
We got quite a fight now in her hands B standings as they are still at the place of Mary Fitzpatrick in third place

682
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Just barely holding on in 4th

683
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
Hot on her heels is Gary Gannon and then way at the back of the pack still in 7th is incumbent Maureen O'Sullivan

684
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,688
Play it had five or six

685
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
Cuz he'll we're back

686
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
This is where two two big things happened

687
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,768
What are the frontrunners expected to take

688
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
It's over the line and also

689
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
Gary Gano jumps into third place it was pushing Mary Fitzpatrick out of a winning spot

690
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,920
It was on the transfers I got cost never recaptured

691
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,248
The woman who under our system would have worn off the bat

692
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,552
Cheap locked out

693
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,392
Yellow

694
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,584
Still hanging on in second-to-last but but also disheartened is our incumbent Mourinho cell

695
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
Who's expecting to

696
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,680
And I suppose maybe seven

697
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
People started to arrive

698
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,312
She actually invited her campaign staff and volunteers back to her place

699
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
For a concession

700
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
And I said when people came in

701
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
I don't want to know anything about the elections

702
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
I got you tomorrow

703
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,600
Unknown to me because I was busy with the T in the Dream Center food

704
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
Some of them in the house

705
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,256
Still in contact with those over in the RGS

706
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,864
Constituency into a reporter Damien Omar development

707
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,168
One of those guys still over in the IDF

708
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Was Mel

709
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
My dudes

710
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Iverson

711
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Looking at the numbers and saying when

712
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Okay

713
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Bus

714
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
If

715
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
Then maybe

716
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Does the chance

717
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:04,256
It was just a thought to have

718
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
All day the media have been saying that Marine without going to be

719
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
Might be eliminated seven something starts to happen

720
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,592
Priefert coming around the bend down and looks like he's in Pole Position

721
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,944
But I was certainly wouldn't reallocating people second preferences ever toured preferences

722
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
We got the stage where we're reallocating people's toward fifth and sixth preferences cuz keep in mind most people

723
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Boats are still flashing around the

724
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
Little Point not only has their Top Choice been knocked out but their second and third as well as their vote

725
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,936
It is now being capped for their fourth fifth or sixth place choice and a lot of those

726
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
They are going to Maury so even people

727
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
Number one number two number three their votes were still carrying pasta for dinner

728
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
Boys I'm just small neon those transferred

729
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Massive jump

730
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Boating her

731
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
The head of two opponents into 4th Place

732
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
Now just a couple hundred vote-buying Gary

733
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,216
And they decided not to tell me

734
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,640
Doctor raised my hopes

735
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
The candy axe

736
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
They redistributor boats

737
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
It's it's coming down it's coming down to it when I count up those transfers

738
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Lucky to be elected or what's the situation there Marine get some 300 more transfers than Gary

739
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
Meaning suddenly

740
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,424
Oh my God I did Nazi that coming

741
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Cheaper than eight votes

742
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,872
Quarter to ten but Maureen mean while it is still convinced she's going to lose

743
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
She's actually heading down to the count Center to

744
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Concede the race

745
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
I said to myself I should go over and concede so and can most into the car and as I'm driving over

746
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
To concede

747
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
I was just at the traffic lights I can picture it

748
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
I'm at that stage

749
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
The phone call comes

750
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
She looked at her phone and it's one of her campaign staff

751
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:21,216
I I don't know why they'd just hurting me up to get over whatever but in fact they were calling because

752
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
Central Roofing

753
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,616
Just as I mentioned your name brand for going to dump in Sanford

754
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
This is the results of the 11th

755
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
For Dublin

756
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Central

757
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
I like dim the following candidate to be Alexa

758
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Are they are

759
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,512
Maureen O'Sullivan

760
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
In her car Maureen did eventually pick up

761
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
Where are you you're about to be like

762
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
You're going to be Alexis

763
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,568
She put down the phone drove to the count Center

764
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
And when she arrived

765
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
Grace God's grace hugs and kisses so it was just

766
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Explosion of

767
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Feeding

768
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Warm feelings

769
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
Towards me from everybody

770
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Maureen O'Sullivan congratulations

771
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
Thank you very much relieved woman

772
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm assumed woman I was home reconciled to a new life outside of politics and then suddenly I'm back in the frame

773
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,448
We had felt that we were too far behind

774
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
I know what Lancer is felt like

775
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
Kind of moments

776
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
What song is this the story of a

777
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Multi-seat

778
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,088
Proportional representation by single transferable vote

779
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Working out

780
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,464
Exactly as it is meant to or is this sort of a pro version of the Sith

781
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,096
No it absolutely is it woke that they will tell you exactly a single transferable vote was meant to do

782
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
One Last Time be gracious Gary

783
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:00,288
Everybody got their cut everybody got their saying everybody got their vote don't get me wrong

784
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
It is

785
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,176
2829 Dan Lake of the u.s. sense of like

786
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Will show you

787
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
Lego movie back

788
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
So

789
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
Single transferable vote on. They work against me

790
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Reno

791
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
I think it worked out perfectly

792
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Perfectly

793
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
I mean let me just see if I get this right

794
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
There's this woman

795
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Maureen

796
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Who

797
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
Hardly anybody loves she's hot

798
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
Scores almost no

799
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
Boots at the favor

800
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
She's just everybody's beer

801
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
No AA 4th 5th 6th I'll choose

802
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Marine

803
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,504
And yet because the votes to keep getting shuffled and shoveled and shoveled

804
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
It's missing that who becomes

805
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
The winner

806
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,648
But she's she's chosen because a lot of people

807
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Don't

808
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Heater

809
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
Yeah what's up

810
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
Here's what it makes me think

811
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,608
Right and I had this moment where I was just

812
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Imagining

813
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,192
If we had been using this at various

814
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,984
Crucial moments in our

815
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Very recent history

816
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,592
Things could have gone an entirely different way

817
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,408
Take the American presidential election of 2016

818
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
Okay between Hillary and Donald Trump

819
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
Hillary Clinton but also

820
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,856
Gary Johnson and Jill Stein

821
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,464
Hardly hardly anybody that number of hardly anybody

822
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,536
That was that's a sizable enough number

823
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
That they

824
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
Could have swung the election one way or the other if you look at

825
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
Veliki state

826
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
The deciding States

827
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
If you presume

828
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:40,896
Gary Johnson votes were split and if you presume all of Jill Stein votes went to Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton would have

829
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Pennsylvania

830
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
Michigan

831
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
And Wisconsin

832
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
And the whole kitten Kaboodle

833
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Well that's

834
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
Interesting

835
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
Another weird thing is you can just keep playing this game and and it'll drive you crazy but you can keep playing until if you go back to

836
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,840
2016 Republican primaries where Donald Trump emerged

837
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,400
Victorious right over 10 people or something

838
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
Over 10 people

839
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,520
But there was a sizable number of people in those primaries

840
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Two word never Trumper

841
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,456
If those people had been able to block their votes together they might have been able to

842
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
Rally behind a candidate who is not

843
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Donald Trump

844
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
It and then rewind even further back

845
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,368
The 2000 election where

846
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
The number of books that Ralph Nader. In Florida more than the difference between Bush got and Gore got no elected elect

847
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
The Republic

848
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,840
Can you okay so it's so go back

849
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
To rust

850
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,240
Wright's George HW Bush was running against Bill Clinton in 1992

851
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
Ross Perot it's

852
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,360
Very controversial whether he really was a spoiler in that election but

853
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:47,200
I mean if you ask them to Bush People they say definitely was

854
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,016
If the perimeters went to Bush's that been

855
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,856
Like Bill Clinton would have just being a historical footnote he wouldn't have being the president

856
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
Like it's like a

857
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Huge

858
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
Huge seismic difference in

859
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
In world history

860
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
So

861
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
When we come back

862
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,728
We're not going to be looking at my own imaginative math we're going to look at what is ranked choice

863
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Actually look like

864
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
It was in the United States

865
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
Because it is in the United

866
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
That's about to happen

867
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
When we come back

868
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,736

Alice Topix

876
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,408
Little bits and pieces

877
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
We have been

878
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
Talking about this and thinking about this around the office for

879
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
For a little while

880
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,112
At some point as we were as we were

881
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,464
Become meditating on this dwindling faith in democracy one of our

882
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,536
Fellow producers that our sister show more perfect

883
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Sarkari

884
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,632
She just took me and Simon great

885
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
Rates and just drag us into his suit

886
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Okay so

887
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
We've been having this

888
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
Conversation about

889
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,616
Whether our democracy is broken for like a

890
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
A few months now and like

891
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,480
Every meeting that we've had I've been the one in the room being like

892
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,320
Guys are democracies finally have you seen other places

893
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
This is crazy like who are these people that

894
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Think like

895
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
Our democracy is broken like they don't know what

896
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,840
They're talking about and you know why I like where where where is that feeling coming from

897
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
Well okay can you tell me your name

898
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,080
And who are you probably because of this woman I was

899
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,919
I was over you in relation to me

900
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,223
Oh I'm your mom my mom is

901
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
And both of my parents actually

902
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,831
Grew up in Pakistan that is the

903
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,927
Fixing 25 years of my life that I spent and I

904
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Field which is

905
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
A pretty young country and its

906
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
It's just struggled so

907
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Much too

908
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,911
Keep its democracy alive and healthy

909
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
And

910
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,055
I saw and the consequences of

911
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,871
Not getting the full demo democracy

912
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
There in Pakistan

913
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Soda

914
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,575
That then after living 25 years of next 25 years of my life in America

915
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
I really found out the value

916
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Off for democracy

917
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
As an individual and as a group also

918
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
So that I can differentiate now

919
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Maryville

920
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Getting to the store

921
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
So

922
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,007
That's kind of how I've always understood our

923
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,127
Button Simon I listened to your Ireland story with

924
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
All of the

925
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,759
Does ranked-choice voting stuff in and that's the first moment when I was like

926
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
Like maybe

927
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,415
Maybe our way of doing things is

928
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Broken leg

929
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Maybe we do need a nap

930
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Okay okay

931
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
What about it

932
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Make made you

933
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
Switch teams

934
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Because

935
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:24,031
Maybe suddenly aware of the fact that in our system Candice

936
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Don't

937
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,383
Actually need a majority of the votes to win

938
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,735
You have canvas who then make that calculation where they say

939
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,807
I only really have to win the votes

940
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
People who are in my base

941
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
If that's

942
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,463
If those if my base is bigger than everybody else's base

943
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,511
Then like screw everyone else

944
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
It is seems like in a democracy

945
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,887
People should vote for the

946
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Person who win

947
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,983
Not just that the person who wins is going to have the biggest

948
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Bass

949
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,311
Bigger base that everybody else

950
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,407
Like it should be that most people are in some way and some preference

951
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
Supporting the first in Utah

952
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,503
Yeah exactly and it's funny like

953
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,831
When I heard about ranked-choice voting I was like

954
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,183
Oh like this system is so cool because it

955
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
I feel like it addresses that exact

956
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Problem

957
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,095
And so I totally got sucked into it and I

958
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
I started looking around

959
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,495
And it turns out there are a bunch of people who think that this

960
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
Could be used here in the US

961
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
And not only that it already is

962
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
And when I asked around

963
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
A number of people appointed to this moment in

964
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
Mm with the election when

965
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,623
Bush loses the popular election but he wins

966
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
Because he wins in Florida

967
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,023
And so people look at the the results in Florida and see that

968
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
A bunch of votes that

969
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
Might have gone to Al Gore

970
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
They go instead to Ralph Nader

971
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
Who then becomes

972
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
You know sort of notorious as the spoiler that

973
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
That maybe

974
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Ruin the election

975
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
Infer Al Gore

976
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,687
And after 2000 at that point you do see some cities that

977
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Start to adopt ranked-choice voting

978
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
At the local level

979
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
And so what I did is

980
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
My phone

981
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,463
I grabbed let this and we kind of did this

982
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
Cross country ranch Choice voting tour

983
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
End

984
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
The first place we're going to start with

985
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Hello San Francisco

986
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Is San Francisco

987
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Is it Dominic

988
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,055
Yes this is Dominic what's up

989
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
What's up

990
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
So this is

991
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,663
Dominic fracassa

992
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
He used to do radio pipes for it Dominic hey let me know if you need me add spot

993
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
So we can get right to it

994
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
But he order at the San Francisco Chronicle

995
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
City Hall reporter for the chronicle

996
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
Yeah so the very first ranked-choice election in Sanford

997
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
Francisco happened in 2000

998
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,703
But it was actually a ranked-choice voting became

999
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
I guess the cities method or the city

1000
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,615
System if you will back in 2002 where there was a a ballot and it

1001
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
It's that was passed by voters

1002
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:14,271
That said like this is going to be the system that that we're going to implement going forward

1003
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,599
So the vast majority of local elected office

1004
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,903
Is are are chosen with with ranked

1005
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,999
So city council supervisor

1006
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
School Board

1007
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
Assessor-recorder

1008
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
One very specific election

1009
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
In the mayor's race

1010
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
The case

1011
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
In the mirror

1012
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Okay great

1013
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,799
I can't believe this was just that a few months ago

1014
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
It seems like a long time ago

1015
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
Okay so early 2018

1016
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
The San Francisco mayor's race

1017
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Kicked off

1018
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,295
And when it really kicked into gear if there were

1019
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
Three leading

1020
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
You had

1021
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
Hi I'm bored

1022
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
London breed

1023
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
You had

1024
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Hello

1025
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,119
Former San Francisco supervisor Mark Leno

1026
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
And you had

1027
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
A current supervisor I Jane Kim

1028
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
And these aren't these are all Democrats

1029
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
The field of candidates

1030
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Set down

1031
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Okay

1032
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,063
So out of the gate San Francisco

1033
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
London breed

1034
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
This camp

1035
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Pain

1036
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
Is a winning campaign

1037
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,719
He was the more moderate more established Kansas

1038
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
She's getting one heck of a bounce in the polls

1039
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
And she had a fairly strong lead in a lot of wind in her sails

1040
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
The closest rival

1041
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Mark Leno

1042
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,079
And as a campaign has made its way to election day

1043
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
We are winners

1044
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
It was almost like

1045
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Sure there are three names on the ballot

1046
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,759
But today was more like London breed London breed

1047
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
And London breed

1048
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,343
The favorite in the recent polls heading into

1049
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Tuesday's election

1050
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
But then

1051
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
Right before the election

1052
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,815
Something happened that you basically never see

1053
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
In American politics

1054
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Never believe that

1055
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
In the very last few weeks

1056
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Before election day

1057
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,527
The two underdogs Jane Kim and Mark Leno

1058
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
They held a press conference on the steps of City Hall

1059
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
Mark and I are

1060
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,511
They stood outside City Hall literally join hands and said

1061
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Porter

1062
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
Wait a second

1063
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:50,175
So what you think of me but also vote for

1064
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
This

1065
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Guilin running again

1066
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Yeah exactly

1067
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Vote for me first

1068
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Vote for James II

1069
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
Vote for me first and vote for marks

1070
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,671
So like if one of us were to come in last

1071
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Like what they Mark comes in

1072
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,815
If all the people who voted for him ranked Jane as their second choice

1073
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
Then all those votes would go to her

1074
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
And vice versa

1075
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
That way

1076
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
They actually have a better chance

1077
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
Of beating the front runner

1078
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
London breed

1079
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
And that made it

1080
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,127
A lot of sense they were both quote-unquote more Progressive

1081
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
If candidates and you know

1082
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
Saw each other at least the rhetoric goes

1083
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Add

1084
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
The person that they'd like to

1085
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
To see as marriage

1086
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
If not them still

1087
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:33,183
Was that was that a surprise move to you as you were covering it did you see that coming

1088
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
No I think that was it

1089
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
A surprise to a lot of

1090
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
Supporting both

1091
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
Jim and Mark

1092
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Vermeer

1093
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
After that press conference

1094
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Jane Kim

1095
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
Started appearing in campaign ads

1096
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
Campaigning

1097
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
For one another

1098
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
UShip

1099
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,975
Is it basically the whole campaign is like if you don't vote for me first and at least feel for me II

1100
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,727
Kpix 5 Joe Vasquez is with the London breed

1101
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Campaign we're just MoMA

1102
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Reed address

1103
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,079
The crowd Joe so

1104
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,359
On Election night

1105
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
London breed has a

1106
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,943
Pretty commanding lead

1107
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
As the poles are coming to a close

1108
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,831
Basically she's trying to get up to this marker of

1109
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
50% of the vote

1110
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Plus one

1111
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,415
That's a majority

1112
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
And if she can get to that

1113
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
Then she went there's no rank choice

1114
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
Runoff there's no vote swapping

1115
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,983
And as the night goes on declaring victory

1116
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,287
But this crowd is celebrating

1117
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,335
She's got like a double-digit z

1118
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
Like things are looking pretty good

1119
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,967
They are celebrating the person they believe could be the next mayor of San Francisco

1120
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,551
Holy smoke she's beating Mark Landau by 10

1121
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
Percentage points

1122
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
And she's beating Jane came by

1123
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,463
So we're getting to midnight I'm completely bleary-eyed staring at my laptop

1124
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Refreshing the Department of Elections

1125
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
State every few sec

1126
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
When

1127
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
12:30 at night

1128
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
It happen

1129
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,055
She came in

1130
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
Just shy 50% all of a sudden

1131
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
This entire race has changed

1132
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
Okay so the rankings have been

1133
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Lemon tree number one

1134
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
Mark Leno number two

1135
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,535
But when Kim got eliminated a huge chunk

1136
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,303
Herberger's

1137
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
About three out of four went to linode

1138
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,679
Because their second choice

1139
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,007
Razor thin margin

1140
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
Jim leonhard strategy

1141
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
Head come to fruition .8

1142
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
4%

1143
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Women

1144
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
The mayor's race is still too close to call

1145
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,343
The race would actually drag on for days as more ballots get counted

1146
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
Thousands of outstanding balance

1147
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,487
We didn't have a mare chosen until I think eight days later

1148
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,863
When in a gymnasium packets

1149
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Screaming supporters

1150
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
Outlet

1151
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,471
The new mayor of San Francisco

1152
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
Yes

1153
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,895
Mark Leno came up

1154
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Chester

1155
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,479
He came within 1.1% or a

1156
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,039
A little over 2500 votes

1157
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Oh man

1158
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
So I mean

1159
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,671
Okay it didn't work in that he didn't win but you can't say that it was

1160
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
Is completely ineffective

1161
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,791
And so so ultimately what did people think of

1162
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
This hole like Mark

1163
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,167
Leonard Gene Kim coming together

1164
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
Strategy as

1165
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
Xgaming the

1166
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
As saying look

1167
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,799
They are doing this

1168
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
In order to keep London breed

1169
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
And that would never got your paper right

1170
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,735
Right that was that at

1171
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,319
I mean people do feel that

1172
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
That it was this

1173
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Strategy

1174
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Especially when

1175
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
42 *

1176
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:20,767
Who saw a teaming up a piling on and in this I mean just to kind of

1177
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
Zoom out all the way I think people just

1178
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
Find that weird in

1179
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
A country

1180
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
In which

1181
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Politics ends up being a

1182
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
A zero-sum game

1183
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,311
In which you are you know relentlessly

1184
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
We attacking you

1185
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
Bloodsport

1186
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
Yeah exactly

1187
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Exactly

1188
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
But

1189
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
At the same time that's very much

1190
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
Either might be some people at my own newspaper that.

1191
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
Disagree with me but I think that's

1192
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Very much in the

1193
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,719
Spirit of what rank Choice voting invites

1194
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
Coalition-building

1195
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Dominic wanted to be clear the

1196
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
In the case of the mayor's race

1197
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,935
This coming together of opponent

1198
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,751
I don't want to make it sound like it was just some kind of Kumbaya.

1199
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
You know because that rude that was

1200
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
But

1201
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
At the very next stop on Archer

1202
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
We actually fell

1203
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
The Kumbaya

1204
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Hey Curtis are you there

1205
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Which

1206
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,159
Also on the line we have let this

1207
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Hi how you doing

1208
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Hey what's up

1209
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
We heard about

1210
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
From this guy

1211
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,351
Curtis Gilbert and I'm a reporter at American public media

1212
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
But I used to be a reporter in Minnesota

1213
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
What radio

1214
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,215
So Curtis told us

1215
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,823
In Minneapolis they actually started using ranked-choice voting in 2009

1216
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,127
But getting much more interesting since the

1217
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
Sew in

1218
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:47,807
2013 was the first time Minneapolis actually had like a competitive mayor's race

1219
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Under ranked-choice voting

1220
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Rent-A-Wreck

1221
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
Record-breaking number of Canada

1222
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
Minneapolis mayor RT Rybak

1223
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
Who's stepping down

1224
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
The end of this year

1225
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
35 candidates

1226
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,631
Signed up to run to replace him

1227
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Yeah

1228
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Curtis Gilbert covers

1229
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
Minneapolis politics

1230
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
He joins me in studio

1231
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,567
Are you back in I mean there were so many

1232
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,359
1035 cannabis is a lot

1233
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,455
Unlike the racing San Francisco the Mayoral race in Minneapolis

1234
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
People say aren't you the Republican

1235
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Did have

1236
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
More diverse

1237
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:22,879
Kansas Republican party and I also stand

1238
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
Fiercely

1239
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
For marriage equality always have

1240
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
There was

1241
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:33,375
A Republican and independent a bunch of Democrats it was a wide-open free-for-all race and it was real

1242
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
Really it was really interesting that

1243
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
Despite all that

1244
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,983
They were

1245
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
Very

1246
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Very

1247
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Civil

1248
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
Thank you very much it's nice to see you're not

1249
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Utterly infallible

1250
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
Ohio

1251
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Very very

1252
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Gentle to each other

1253
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,039
We won't be rude with each other

1254
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,599
What doesn't benefit us to be rude

1255
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,719
And this is one thing that you know The Advocates of ranked-choice voting serve look at as a pot

1256
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,279
You know voters voters are turned off by negative

1257
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
And there's a

1258
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Theory

1259
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,423
That goes that if you're hoping to get like second and third choice votes

1260
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,311
You'll be much nicer to your opponent so you don't alienate their supporters so maybe you get a second or third choice vote

1261
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
And it did seem

1262
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Like

1263
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,919
There is an element of that playing out

1264
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,967
I'm in in the race

1265
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
I will

1266
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
Talk more about

1267
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
All the issue

1268
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Cuz I think I've run out of

1269
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,623
Thank you at work there was like

1270
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,927
Some light ribbing

1271
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Tencent

1272
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
They were polite

1273
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
Stage Logistics

1274
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,631
Getting out of that chair is a little challenging

1275
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
So we may want to

1276
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
The microphone around

1277
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
And

1278
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Plenty of

1279
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Yeah I mean

1280
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,383
The most remarkable one of all

1281
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
What's the final two

1282
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
I was there and it was in it

1283
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,599
Church in Downtown Minneapolis with the church was

1284
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
And at the

1285
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
The end of the debate

1286
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,255
The candidates and I think there were eight of them

1287
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
All

1288
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:11,679
Kind of put their arms around each other and one of them suggested that they all sing timer but I am I was

1289
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Kumbaya

1290
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
No

1291
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,783
After the debate after the debate

1292
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,023
That's going on Instagram

1293
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,663
So it's like I mean it's almost like a cartoon right like the Kumbaya it's really

1294
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
Funny

1295
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
Right but it's also

1296
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
It's

1297
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,807
It's also I think for a lot of people right now that

1298
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Feels like a relief

1299
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
If you'll take a relief to hear politicians not biting each other

1300
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Heads off

1301
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,719
And that

1302
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,791
That's something that comes from ranked-choice voting you fine

1303
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,607
Consensus you find Coalition you find

1304
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Commonalities

1305
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Difference

1306
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
But

1307
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
That also

1308
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,823
Flattens everyone out if everyone ends up running to the middle

1309
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
And then you just

1310
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
Have kind of a

1311
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,687
A bland consensus

1312
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,247
Yes or no one's saying bold things

1313
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,783
And everybody is just

1314
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Kind of

1315
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Middle

1316
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,671
So in a way when you make this Choice your choosing

1317
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
4

1318
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,743
Do this carefully

1319
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
What is careful

1320
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,119
I wondered about that cuz I'm thinking maybe don't do this carefully

1321
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,959
Maybe have a country that can be dynamic level right now

1322
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
Yeah

1323
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,151
We are that is in deep in a deep way that's what's being asked him like what do we

1324
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
What do we actually want

1325
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
Do we want a system where

1326
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,903
You know you are lined up behind your Alpha Dog who's going to who's going to argue for all of the things you want

1327
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,023
Want an end and maybe you can get them but maybe you're also going to lose them all or

1328
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,119
Or do you want it do you know being a system where you know your

1329
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
We're all kind of

1330
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,983
Started begrudgingly bought into

1331
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
Irr second-place person who get behind but like

1332
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
Definitely wasn't

1333
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,431
He knows how to write deal and I think that's a question

1334
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,479
That's like a soul-searching kind of a question

1335
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,831
Michael what do you want and what we want this country to be and for that reason

1336
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Like I don't know how I feel

1337
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:44,255
Just going to be perfect I think it's really interesting is what seemed sort of mechanical

1338
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
And

1339
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Technical

1340
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,607
It does

1341
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,143
The tone

1342
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,727
Your country and history so the world we've got is the function

1343
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
How we vote

1344
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
Change this

1345
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
System.of always vote

1346
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,079
Can I get a very different world

1347
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,943
What different what different we're different food China different scary different good different

1348
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
You don't know

1349
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
Well we might actually know soon

1350
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,087
Because I actually have one more stop

1351
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:15,743
Cross country ranked Choice voting tour the Great

1352
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,327
State of Maine

1353
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
Super politically diverse

1354
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,447
Fiercely independent like a lot of independent voters

1355
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,847
An infected in 2016 there was this

1356
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,663
Coalition of Independence and Democrat

1357
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
That Minister get this

1358
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Ballot initiative

1359
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
That would change all Statewide elections to ranked-choice voting

1360
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
Statewide

1361
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
Yeah

1362
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
And Rachel's voting was

1363
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Adopted into

1364
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,791
16 according to Maine public radio reporter Steve mistler

1365
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
It passed

1366
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
The past however

1367
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
With a major flaw

1368
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
BM

1369
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,751
Undermine the Integrity of our election process

1370
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
The state

1371
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
Senate

1372
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
Was under Republican

1373
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Control at

1374
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
The time

1375
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Picked up on

1376
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,711
Is constitutional conflict

1377
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
Within a conflict within the state

1378
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
Constitutionality is we're not happy with it

1379
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,879
Like my post

1380
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,023
The main Constitution literally says you have to use a plurality vote the word plurality is actually written

1381
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,095
In the Constitution as opposed to a majority

1382
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Correct

1383
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
And ultimately the Maine legislature

1384
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Past

1385
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
Oh law

1386
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,751
That delayed implementing

1387
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Ranked-choice voting

1388
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
This is one more example

1389
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Of where

1390
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
Yeah politician

1391
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,223
Ark standing against

1392
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,903
And it set off this whole fight where where people rallied against the state legislature and held another vote

1393
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,671
In June

1394
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
Literally this

1395
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,999
This past June at the Statehouse this

1396
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
Morning to get around the delay

1397
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Nature through what

1398
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Was billed as a people's veto

1399
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
That passed

1400
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,655
I almost the exact same margin

1401
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
If not slightly more

1402
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,239
In what it passed originally in 20

1403
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
16

1404
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,823
At some point the main Supreme Court gets involved

1405
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,919
And really the details of this are all kind of a mess but

1406
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,711
What it boils down to is

1407
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
Any upcoming election

1408
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,063
Like the midterms that are happening now

1409
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Maine will use

1410
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
Ranked-choice voting

1411
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
For its Congressional races

1412
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
We have three of them this year

1413
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,535
We have a first congressional

1414
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,815
District race

1415
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:31,423
It'll be used in that contest and also in Maine's 2nd congressional district

1416
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,959
Which is a swing C1

1417
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
You know what dozen or so nationally AK one of the districts that everybody's going to be watching in the midterms

1418
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,919
And on top of that they're going to use

1419
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,247
Ranked-choice voting for the Senate US Senate

1420
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:51,391
Campaign will be using that contest

1421
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,439
4 position in the federal government

1422
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
Yeah no other state has ever done it but

1423
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,863
At the same time because of their state constitutions not being used

1424
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
In the gubernatorial race

1425
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,703
So does the ballot just like look in

1426
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Same like

1427
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Part of it is like

1428
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
Ranked-choice voting thing and

1429
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
And part of it is

1430
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,127
Isn't like they're just suck

1431
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:18,015
So they're separate ballots for the federal races and then there's a separate one for the Statewide ones

1432
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,831
I haven't actually seen how many ballots that voters are

1433
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,647
So this is really going to happen now like like

1434
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
This week yeah oh yeah

1435
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,767
Two main claims of ranked-choice voting or being put to the test

1436
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,863
In the very first and it's very first

1437
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
Roll out in Maine

1438
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,751
Voters in Maine will head to the polls later this month can work for

1439
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,335
A third party or independent candidates

1440
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,895
But is also a test case

1441
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
About whether or not

1442
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,223
It does what it promises

1443
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
You just told another big

1444
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
Right in front of everybody

1445
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,599
You're lying about my roaches reproduce

1446
01:03:54,879 --> 01:04:01,023
Scorched-earth campaign

1447
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
Slide

1448
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,847
21 *

1449
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Also

1450
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,447
I guess I'd I just wonder if

1451
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,287
The people of Maine are going to come out of

1452
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
This election

1453
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
Feeling

1454
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
A little bit more like

1455
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
Like democracy is working for them

1456
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
Wouldn't it be interesting

1457
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
If

1458
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,423
In Maine somebody who was you know everybody's 8

1459
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
Choice

1460
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
