Start

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
Should I try to sound Southern

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
With a guy named Woody connect from a lawyer with Essex Richards

23
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
A law firm in Charlotte North Carolina

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Pick it up in 1985 by 295 I was a very young lawyer I was 32 years

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
So I just started Mountain Law Firm

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
And I was talking about anything that came through the door

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
And 1 days

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
This guy walked in late 30s

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
Fairly thin

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
5.95 foot 10 bone crushers

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Annie's he's a black man

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
PS

33
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
Or was he passed away

34
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Mr Graham

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,400
The man's name is Katherine Graham and what he says

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Well

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Like white what happened your leg what's with the crutches

38
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,104
And the thorn lays everything out for him.

39
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,968
So he was pulled over on West Boulevard in Charlotte which is

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
Four lane road

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,320
Buddy he work for the city of Charlotte in the department of

42
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
Station on road crews doing Road repairs

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
It was Monday afternoon and on that day when adjusting one's friends or co-workers stop by

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:13,888
After talking for a bit Mr Graham asked to be taken to a nearby convenience store

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
It was only two or three blocks from his house

46
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
He needed some orange juice

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Because he was

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,848
Suffering the onset of a diabetic insulin reaction

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
Soda Thorn Hopkins from car

50
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,504
They drove over to the convenience store to Thorn got out got a bottle of orange juice

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Got to the checkout counter but

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
There's a line there

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,952
So I put the bottle down and hurries out get back in Sprint car they take off

54
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Now

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
This is where the problems

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Started

57
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,216
10. At the same time all that's happening there's actually an officer who was African-American

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
Sitting in his squad car and what that officer observed was a man hurrying out of the store jumping

59
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
Sing into a waiting car and

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Quickly driving off

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
So you started to hail the thorn in his friend but after a couple of blocks

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
Pull them over just to determine what was going on there

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,232
So he goes up to the driver side presumably gets to Thorns buddies drivers

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Goes back to his squad car

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
Start radioing

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Get ahold of the store to see if anything that happened

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
And it's right around that moment.

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
The passenger

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Seed of

70
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
The car suddenly opened

71
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
His door got out of the car

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Circle the car once or twice

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,456
Lake Sardis stumbled around it. Down on the car

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
He started going

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
In shock

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,416
Almost like a seizure he would have a really yeah and it was terrifying

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
This is the thorn Graham jr. he was a type 1 diabetic what is type 1 diabetes been with one and two or more.

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Understand the type 1 diabetes

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
Is when your body just doesn't produce enough

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
Insulin

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
It won't be that seizure look like

82
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Like well

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
One incident in particular

84
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
Art remembers being in church and he got like this Blank Stare on his face and

85
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,808
You see the beads of sweat come on his forehead his body was seized up and he was shaking

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
He would bite his tongue up and

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm so I can remember my mother trying to let you know for sure spoon into his mouth for keeping from

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Biting his tongue up and

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
The main thing was try to get some orange juice and that way it would raise his

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Blood sugar in

91
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,983
And what you got the orange juice and heat sleep for a couple hours and then he'd wake up and

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
DB exhaust

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
But he be alive

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Alright so

95
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
Charlotte City street at this point

96
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Four other officers arrived

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Thorn has actually passed

98
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Out on the curb one of the officers

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
Rome Instagram over on the sidewalk

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
And cuffed his hands behind his

101
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Is back

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
At what point

103
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Have one of your officers

104
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
Rab's Thorn by the handcuffs in

105
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Picks him up

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Off the curb from from behind

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
The Thorn was sort of in and out at this point I guess he tries to tell the officers but it was a diabetic but he had a medical card

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
Cardinals wallet ask the officer to pull the wallet out of his back pocket

109
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
And one of the officers

110
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
Said ain't nothing wrong with the motherfuker Buddies truck

111
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
At some point around here the details are a little unclear

112
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Pretty nasty scuffle ensued

113
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,095
According to what is known as kasodus of the storm was resisting the officers and apparently officers slam Des Moines head into his friends

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,703
Car is over head and shoulder injuries he also ended up with a broken foot cut around the wrist

115
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
And eventually

116
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
The officers pick him up

117
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
One on each arm one on each leg and just

118
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Throw him in the back

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Back of a squad

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,807
While this was going on a few people gathered around and how long after that

121
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
The officers

122
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
Learned that nothing at all had happened at the convenience store there was no crime there was no robbery there was no show

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Shoplifting

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Set a dragon back to his house still in handcuffs

125
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
The car

126
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Infinity Stones has gotten some OJ

127
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
And the officers

128
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Lay them out in

129
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
Front yard took the handcuffs off and then just drive away

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Was there an apology

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Oh no

132
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
Now what came out of that day in Charlotte

133
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
Would end up becoming one of the most important

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Supreme Court cases

135
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
History when it comes to pleasing

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
And

137
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
What you mean about this case is how something like you needed some orange juice

138
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Something so seemingly small

139
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
Would eventually become tied to this and all the

140
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
Shootings we've seen in the past years mostly of young black men every time we hear one of these shootings every time there

141
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,111
Alki everytime the copy atop this incident is looming in the shadows

142
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,671
Shaping the outcome

143
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,511
In many ways it is quietly Define the air that we're living in

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,119
And I wanted to know how

145
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
How did it happen

146
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Rihanna

147
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Supreme Court of the United

148
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
God save United States and this honorable Court

149
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,631
At 21.2 clock little bit I will say this about my dad now he wasn't someone that would

150
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
Would just lay down and roll over

151
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
Talkington storing Junior I asked him a little bit about his dad and he told me that the thorn senior group in the Southeastern North Carolina

Pixar African-American accepted to Duke University

158
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
But

159
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
My grandmother

160
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,023
She wouldn't let him go because of you know doing this are right there that she didn't want him to have to experience

161
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
All that

162
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
All that mess

163
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,935
This is a CBS News special report in spillover the kind of day I mean like the Civil Rights

164
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
Movement was a lot of things but there was this big part of it that was about

165
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
Police brutality

166
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
Angeles

167
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
Also known as the long hot summer of 1967

168
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,511
50 race riots across the country

169
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
A lot of which was sparked by accusations of police brutality

170
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
50 Cent

171
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
I will not

172
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,567
Accept charges against policeman I will not

173
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Except

174
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Charges against policeman this is a statement

175
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,831
Might be any difference might not be any different

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
You understand that

177
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
If we cannot bring charges against the policeman who have murdered us

178
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
I just throw it out homes and businesses where will we go

179
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Where will we go

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
She didn't want him to have to experience

181
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
All that all that mess

182
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
So ended up I think he ended up on the Fayetteville State

183
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Inspected by college in North Carolina

184
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
And when you graduated actually one of the first jobs that he had he work for an employer called Precision spray

185
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,135
Spring Steel company that specialize in making Springs but at a certain point you assuming the company

186
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
Discrimination based on how they were treating you

187
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
You know people of color

188
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,095
So after that day with the officers and Charlotte one thing I do remember

189
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Dad saying was that it wasn't right

190
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Difference in a fight

191
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Right

192
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,311
And that is how he ends up walking into Woody's office on crutches in 1985

193
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
He tells what he

194
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
I want to sue the Charlotte Police Department

195
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
So we went ahead and just filed a lawsuit in federal court Woody takes it to trial and basically is arguing

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Squeezed I had used excessive force

197
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,487
That was totally unnecessary under the circumstances like they roughed up a diabetic who is telling them

198
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
He was a diabetic

199
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Eventually the judge presiding over the

200
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Ruled that

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,215
These officers did not use excessive force and if you were going to

202
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Claim that they did

203
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
We had to

204
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,847
Show that the police officers had acted

205
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
Maliciously for the purpose

206
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Causing harm

207
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,783
Hot today they had to prove that the officers at cement

208
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
To hurt him

209
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah that Woody and the thorn had to prove that the officers

210
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
Had it out for the thorn and we simply couldn't do that

211
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
If it seems like a really hard thing to

212
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
Prove it's an almost impossible standard to me

213
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
I think it's important to zoom in on this for a second because it's really kind of like the

214
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Crux of the story

215
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,847
If the question is what should the standard be for holding

216
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Cop cannibal

217
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Portuguese

218
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
The forest ending

219
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
In the mid-eighties

220
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,527
Malicious intent was sort of the prevailing stand

221
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
If you're going to claim

222
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
That a police officer use excessive force

223
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
It's you and the standard was that you had to prove

224
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
That the officer did so

225
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
With malice in their heart

226
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
Why was that the standard

227
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,959
This is kind of hard to explain. I don't have the 14th amendment in front of me but it

228
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Essentially

229
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,823
All you really need to know is that it was connected the Fourteenth Amendment to a particular clause

230
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
In the Fourteenth Amendment

231
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
And this is why would he in the thorn lost that

232
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,295
It's okay alright so loses a federal court loses Federal makes its way up to the fourth Circuit Court of Appeals

233
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
That went nowhere

234
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
The Court of Appeals

235
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
World against us

236
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Same thing same thing

237
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Then nothing after that ruling what are you get the phone call and you hear me from this

238
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Jerry Beaver unknown civil rights lawyer in the area in Fayetteville North Carolina Gerald was older and wiser

239
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
So then maybe that's your wording not mine

240
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,151
Gary had caught wind of the circumcision images Lake

241
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
You should not have to require that

242
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Police officer had it in for you

243
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
I just wanted to beat the crap out of you just cuz it made him feel better

244
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
So I called Woody and said are you guys planning on taking this case to the Supreme Court and we was like no

245
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
McClain can't really afford that I said tell him he doesn't have to worry about that we will be glad to take it on pro bono

246
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
When see if we can get this ruling overturned

247
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Make sure that what you said

248
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Sure

249
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Let's go

250
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
So Jane we get together and they start looking around like like without their what cases can we draw and argue that there should

251
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
Be a different standards and there was this well of Glee season 4 cases

252
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Bubbling up in the court and you had lawyers trying out all these different ideas now most of the courts were using the four

253
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
14th Amendment malicious intent standard that during would even like then there was also in the number of cases

254
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
What's the eighth unusual punishment

255
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
From there what is cruel what is unusual

256
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
Imply that you're trying to hurt somebody right

257
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
But

258
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
The winters are there men in at some of the courts were you seen that

259
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Woody and Jerry look

260
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Tuazar sort of like

261
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Redeemer

262
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
The Fourth Amendment 4th amendment

263
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
The 4th amendment which is

264
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
Swim which is the government cannot subject citizens to unreasonable search and seizure

265
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
I have it on my legal pad

266
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
The fourth amendment is

267
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
The right of the people to be

268
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Secure in their persons houses papers and effects

269
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Against unreasonable searches and seizures

270
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Shall not be

271
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Violated

272
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,903
It is seizure just another word

273
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Perforce

274
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Like I have the right not to eat

275
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
Beating your shot by my government yeah it's it's not just that but yes it it also includes that

276
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
And it's like so much about the fourth amendment is that in there

277
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Is this one

278
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Important

279
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Worried

280
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
Unreasonable reasonable reasonable

281
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Concept of reasonable

282
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
What is reasonable and what is not raised

283
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,271
In law reasonable is it supposed to be object

284
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
You look at the case from the facts of the case

285
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
You look at the who what where when

286
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,487
Not the correct then you asked was this person's Behavior reasonable

287
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
Or not they have to act with objective reasonableness

288
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Wait a second reasonableness is a slippery thing

289
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,263
What you find reasonable would I find reasonable could very well be different be completely different yes or no

290
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,615
It can feel slippery but legally the whole concept of reasonableness have

291
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Hundreds of years

292
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Use of

293
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Precedent

294
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,343
I mean I I find this very fascinating and I don't know if you want me to give you like a little bit of

295
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Backstory

296
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Do you want

297
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,535
To give me a little bit of ice. It's interesting how it came to be and how popular it is

298
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Take me to take me on the ride

299
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,959
Okay alright so we go back to the 1830s Andrew Jackson

300
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,335
Elgyem this is going to be like a little windy but I think it kind of makes sense so

301
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
In 1832 sky at all catala

302
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
I don't get away is a mathematician he's an astronomer if you want to picture something he had Hollow cheeks

303
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
He's big sideburns

304
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
A little bit like

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
David

306
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Straight turn

307
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
The guy from

308
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
The Edward Murrow movie

309
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Jason Bourne movies

310
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,495
Music that helps you at all

311
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
Set up an observatory but astronomers

312
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Have this issue

313
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,199
They had trouble pinpointing the location of stars because their telescopes work

314
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
So bad

315
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
But Kelly was one of those farmers who knew you could use

316
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
Asset statistics difficulty

317
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
How you could

318
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,231
Take an average of all the different measurements and average of the meteorological data and I can help you pinpoint

319
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
We're stars were actually going to be in the sky

320
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,631
Lego that they can make predictions

321
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
It's whoever seems like revolutionising

322
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Astronomy

323
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Italy became

324
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
Fascinated by this idea of averages and what he did is he

325
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
He kind of took that idea

326
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
I took it down from the heavens from the sky and started applying it to

327
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Cute

328
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
So you can call me through data in medical journals trying to determine the average height of a person the average weight

329
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Temperature

330
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
Was he trying to come up with these or proto-man Tennessee

331
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
Totally ever had a huge impact on public health

332
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
But

333
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,143
Ginza actually going Beyond this and Beyond just like physical traits and starts to like push into

334
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
Man's morality and he's looking at crime rates

335
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Suicide rates

336
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Marriage rates

337
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
And in the 1830s he starts

338
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Laying out this concept what is

339
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
I in French

340
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Loam when which

341
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
Translates into the average

342
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Man

343
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
The average man so so this is like big data 1830 Style

344
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Yeah and in this idea of the average man

345
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
And they became

346
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
They're useful in law

347
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
English law

348
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Really

349
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
How exactly

350
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Money

351
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
In Victorian England there was Much Ado About people who wanted to sue for damages or left advantages there were

352
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Need for Thompson averages

353
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,663
Way to take measure in stock to see if a person block

354
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
This really seemed like the best way to determine if the accused had to pay that you've wet

355
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
English judges they decreed here's how we will

356
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Guilds meaning

357
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
What a man

358
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,839
Honest and have him raise his right hand let's say he's back some hay in a terribly negligent way much more

359
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
More like a funeral pyre caught his neighbor's home totally on fire

360
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,959
But he says that he did

361
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
Nothing wrong so Jerry I ask of you what is it that we shall do how about think of ordinary Folk

362
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Avenger

363
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Take a look

364
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Attic use that hand

365
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
And ask yourself

366
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
This one question

367
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Did he behave

368
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Like you're ordinary

369
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Average

370
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Reasonable man

371
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Wow

372
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
I didn't even know you had that in you

373
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
If it's okay

374
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
So you're saying

375
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,239
Judges and juries begin to use these averages as a way to

376
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Disorder like

377
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Figure out like if you're suing somebody else

378
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
If it's somebody else did they act out of the ordinary where they unreasonable

379
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Yeah it was this.

380
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
You can lay in this whole average man thing that English law

381
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Started developing this idea this

382
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Standard don't initially

383
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
As the reasonable man

384
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Standard

385
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,207
Eventually switches a person to be a little bit more

386
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Gender inclusive

387
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
This reasonable person

388
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
It's one of the longest established

389
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
Fictional characters that exist in what is known as like the legal Village we have these other little characters like it starts with the reasonable person

390
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,823
And then you start you get like a slew of these other

391
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
These other characters that come out of that which is I have a little list there's

392
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
The ordinary prudent man of business

393
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,343
The officious bystander there is De fair-minded and informed

394
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Observer

395
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,511
There's the reason Bulger there's the reasonable parent there's a reasonable landlord there's a reasonable neurosurgeon reasonable civil engineer their cellular

396
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Hairdresser

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Really sort of like it's like in any sort of

398
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
Trade or craft

399
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
Where there is business being done or you have the ability within your craft

400
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Harm somebody

401
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
Legally it became very useful to have an

402
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Average archetypal person

403
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Doing that crap

404
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
So that the jury or the judge

405
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
Would have something to use as a measurement when rendering judgment

406
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
It's interesting so like in the hairdresser example

407
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,975
Whatever it was that led to that phrase

408
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,351
Probably was a kettle alien survey in an imagine one of hairdresser Behavior

409
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
Yeah like like maybe you went in to get a haircut and you walked out and 1/2 years gone right and you're just like weird half

410
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,871
And then it's just you go to Courtney like any reasonable hairdresser would not have made that cut

411
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Right

412
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
What starts with this astronomer and ends up with this

413
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
Village of reasonableness the funny thing about the village

414
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Please

415
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,415
So like in English law

416
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
Like Matt said there's like this Village of people but in England at the

417
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
The time they had this idea that

418
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
It wasn't like

419
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,375
A village it was people on a bus

420
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Call the man on the Clapham Omnibus which is roughly I looked at the London bus route 88

421
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
People are they going

422
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
I don't know they just ride the all day those people just waiting for the case to come up and be a hairdresser

423
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
In the next. Concept moved in like Australia was like okay we should do that until one part called that the man in the Bondi

424
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Another Park called at the man on the Bourke Street tram

425
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Hong Kong got it

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
And they said it's a man on the

427
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
Shank shank E1 tram to the bus is just a convenient vessel to hold all these reasonable people

428
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
England said all these people are on a bus

429
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Because

430
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
You didn't want someone who's like

431
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
So slowly

432
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,504
That they are like they're not riding the bus they like hold up in a cave somewhere or someone that is like

433
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
Play upon their Castle it's like the common man it was described as reasonably educated intelligent button

434
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Nondescript

435
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
And I think like what what Woody

436
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
And Jerry

437
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
To bring it all the way back we're centrally

438
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,680
Trying to do is to say we need to use the 4th amendment in this idea of unreasonable search and seizure

439
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
To create a reasonable offer

440
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,104
So we need to add a reasonable officer to the Village or the bus

441
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
So

442
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Bradley the cases submitted

443
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,064
In 1989 almost five years after everything happened to the store in Graham that one day in Charlotte

444
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
It will hear argument next number 87 6571 his case went before The Supreme Court

445
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Graham vs Connor

446
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
Now it's almost there for the arguments we was there

447
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
The Spectator

448
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
Watch in the case of butterflies

449
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Of course

450
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
You may proceed whenever you're ready

451
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
If the Chief Justice

452
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,664
Combat place to court pretty quickly these arguments you don't know what

453
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
Turn into like this word soup

454
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Standard free. Jerry

455
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
The lawyer for the officers

456
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
The justices

457
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Subjective

458
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,536
Getting super meta about what constitutes

459
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
Activity objectively unreason

460
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Black subjectivity

461
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
Subjective factor analysis test

462
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Standards of object

463
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Anthony objective analysis

464
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
Bad Intent no intent

465
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Woodward

466
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Until

467
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
One Justice

468
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
Thurgood Marshall the lone African-American the Quarry

469
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
Clumsy Ninja task

470
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,368
What reason was there for a diabetic

471
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
At the time the officers didn't know that he was

472
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Diabetic

473
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,608
So violent you had to be there

474
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,216
Do you have to go back once that's even before the officer Connor

475
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
So application

476
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
In a very suspicious menu

477
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,200
Oriental convenience store

478
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
What did he do that was violent

479
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Mr Perry's

480
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,624
Testimony is petitioners on Whitten

481
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Petition was throwing his hands around

482
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
The berry had asked for officer

483
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
What procedure

484
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
What was he doing before they tried to put

485
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
Was acting in a very bizarre manner

486
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Ran out of the car

487
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Circle around it twice

488
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
And then sat down

489
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,944
District Court

490
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,760
The officer didn't have to wait until he is

491
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
Any strike anybody

492
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
He was acting Indiana drug predictable and potentially dangerous

493
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
Can you answer to

494
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
He did not overly sweat

495
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Tri-County

496
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
Did he have a weapon of any kind

497
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
The record of

498
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
The residential rehab

499
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
The record shows that he was properly stop

500
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Has a suspect

501
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
Criminal investigation

502
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,576
He was acting suspiciously that he was acting in a bizarre

503
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Manor

504
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
Did even after he was handcuffed in the officers wanted to put them in the car the Undisputed record shows that he was vigorously fighting and Kicking

505
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Subject to being arrested

506
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Rather than

507
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Giving Tree

508
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
You would never

509
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
He was handcuffed

510
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
Because the officers were concerned that he was a criminal

511
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
He was acting a very unusual and erratic way

512
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
He was

513
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,760
Throwing his hands around indeed a district court stated from the record that he was handcuffed in part to protect him

514
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
As well as the officer

515
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
That's the VA District Court summarize the record

516
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
As indicated

517
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
They are different

518
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Different illusions

519
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
When Justice Marshall

520
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Said that

521
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Suddenly

522
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
Hard adjudge

523
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
Who understood our point of view

524
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Somebody gets it

525
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
And

526
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
All of a sudden

527
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
I felt like I was not an idiot after all

528
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,744
Then she put that their opinion it's written by the Chief Justice William rehnquist

529
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
And in opinion requests

530
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Skipping a little bit

531
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
Claims that law enforcement officials have used excessive force

532
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,288
In the course of an arrest investigatory stop or other quote-unquote seizure

533
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,360
Other free citizen are most properly characterized

534
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
Is invoking the protections of the Fourth Amendment

535
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,040
Which guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable teachers

536
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
And must be judged

537
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,648
By reference to the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard

538
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,000
So they get their reasonable officer standard they get it

539
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Any get it unanimous

540
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
The nine nothing opinion

541
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Whoa

542
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
It was a breakthrough

543
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:55,360
I don't think it'd be a stretch to say that at the time to a lot of people were concerned about

544
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Howdy

545
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
PCS Forest

546
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
It felt like this was speaking

547
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,064
The new era that favored plaintiffs and claim us

548
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,136
Now if you were a victim of police violence

549
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,024
You want Justice you have this new Universal standard objective standard we no longer have

550
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
The show The Office

551
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Is active

552
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:21,472
Maliciously or sadistically

553
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Facts of the case

554
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
And you say what a reasonable officer do the same thing

555
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Or not

556
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
Established like what a reason Lobster is what they would do by calling experts looking at dad about age and rank

557
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Stranger things

558
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
What's up with that this would be

559
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Objective

560
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
For the first time in hundreds of years maybe they would have

561
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
An objective

562
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Standard that was a break

563
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
After winning

564
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
Did the case get kick back down to the Circuit like what happens to the thorn

565
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
Everyone in the Supreme Court

566
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
The case went back

567
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
To the trial court level for another trial

568
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Effect of it

569
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,552
I'm sorry Mr Graham had another day in court another trial we picked another jewelry

570
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,952
That represented the better insulin reaction bottle of orange juice pulled him over unconscious and coughed

571
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
Physical education broken foot lacerations risk

572
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Bruised forehead squad car front yard

573
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
The guy who did nothing wrong

574
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Amazon

575
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
The case was given to the jury

576
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Injury was told

577
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Okay

578
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Knowing what you now know

579
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
Take the standards reasonable standard and ask yourself

580
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
Is what happened to the store in Graham

581
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Reasonable

582
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
The jury deliberated came back out

583
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
And I decided in favor of

584
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
The police office

585
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Pussers Mr Graham lost

586
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,840
Now what do you think is real or not at the jury really focused in on the police officers

587
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Perspective

588
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
And from the office

589
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,984
Protective all they saw was a black man running in and out of convenience store

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
They thought you might be stealing something they had no idea he was a diabetic

591
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,200
I'm up he was a little bit out of control car creating trouble

592
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
Aesthetic but he's drunk

593
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Mike dangerous

594
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
Reasonable officer would subdue that person

595
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
Excuse me I'm so sorry

596
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
There goes the dog in yard

597
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,912
So when I got it turned green junior he was actually moving from his home in St Louis

598
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Did Ryan I'm still open the garage up

599
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
Back to Brazil had a lot of family in Charlotte

600
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Okay I'm on back

601
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Hopefully I ain't cocaina

602
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,432
I was just wondering did your dad talked about the

603
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
About what happened that day or do you talk about the court case at all

604
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
He didn't

605
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
It wasn't something that he talked about

606
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,136
Different Junior says that established

607
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
I'm trying to get on with his life he started making Furniture in his spare time

608
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
Going to church a lot but

609
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
He had his he had his troubles

610
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
He had a p ends up having

611
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
A substance abuse issue

612
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
So

613
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
And what

614
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,336
Fortunately you you was able to overcome that and

615
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,176
That was after the Supreme Court case after this correct that's correct

616
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
So I mean I don't know if

617
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
His this way of trying to deal with that was

618
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
Do substance abuse

619
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
I don't know

620
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
When you are dehumanized

621
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Like that

622
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
When when another individual

623
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Weather today

624
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,592
It's you know it's kind of hard to explain math but when when someone

625
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
Who has Authority

626
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
Just eat

627
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
This is like

628
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
They is like they take something away from you

629
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,928
When someone does something like that to you

630
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
It strikes at your core

631
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
It strikes at your very being

632
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
And I think you lose a part of yourself

633
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
That you can't get back

634
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,640
Franklin senior died in the year 2000 he was 54 years old

635
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
But after his death

636
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
Is named lived on in this case

637
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Naseberry

638
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Weird

639
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Way

640
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
So 2014 is tonight after an unarmed African-American teenager was shot and killed

641
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
Police in St Louis suburb of Ferguson Missouri

642
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
Not far from where does Warren G live

643
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
A white officer Darren Wilson

644
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,592
Shot and killed a black teenager Michael Brown a reporter from CNN contacted me

645
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
And you talk about how

646
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
They want to use my dad's

647
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Case doing that trial

648
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
As a defense

649
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Pretty officer

650
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
The CNN report in pharmacy

651
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
That's not what I had no idea

652
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
The grand jury deliberated over two days

653
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
Making their final decision

654
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
What equation shows the jury was

655
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,608
Did Officer Darren Wilson act recently

656
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
We shot Michael Brown

657
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,264
They determined that no probable cause exists to file any charges against officer Wilson

658
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,592
And returned a no true bill on each of the five and dime

659
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
That was reasonable

660
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
They killed her baby man

661
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,512
Object Java

662
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:39,168
Same here shot and killed by two officers while holding a pellet gun

663
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Jimmy ryce we are instructed to ask what

664
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
Original police officer

665
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Would do in this particular situation

666
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,896
Detroit found that the officer who shot and killed the 12 year old boy Tamir rice

667
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Did recently

668
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
Ben

669
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,112
Eric Garner

670
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Get another white police officer

671
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
Set an unarmed black man reasonable John Crawford on 18 year old black man killed last month

672
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,400
Reasonable

673
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,752
Samuel Dubose

674
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,848
Reasonable Alton Sterling

675
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:25,248
Reasonable reasonable

676
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,624
Oklahoma Charlotte

677
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Philando Castile

678
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Reasonable

679
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Are you kidding me right now

680
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,376
We're not evolving as a civilization

681
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Where did Bobby

682
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
We're going back down tonight

683
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
And in almost every one of those cases

684
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
Graham vs Connor Supreme Court decision

685
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,600
How many people felt was supposed to establish a new Universal standard that would deliver Justice

686
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
For victims of police violence

687
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
In almost every one of those cases it ended up doing

688
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
The exact opposite

689
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
Victims from getting relief

690
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
And instead

691
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Protected the cops

692
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,520
One person my colleague who covers cops describes it as like cops cops ehat is like their first amendment

693
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
Texas break glass

694
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
How did that

695
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:34,624
And we'll watch it app

696
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,792
More perfect will continue in a moment

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

703
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,280
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting the show

704
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

705
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

706
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Brilliance

707
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
Basically I want to hear about those times when I

708
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,384
I kid you know did something

709
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
It just means you lean back and say whoa

710
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:38,112
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

711
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

712
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,024
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

713
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,632
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry

714
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
We're interested in the

715
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Specific moments where

716
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,824
A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

717
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
If you have a story please share it with us

718
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,248
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message

719
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
And that's radiolab.org / brilliance

720
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Thank you so much

721
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,240
This is more perfect I'm Jad abumrad we're featuring more perfect on Radiolab today

722
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,592
Me to say a few words for contact police officers have dangerous

723
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,688
I think we can all agree and on occasion they do have to use Force

724
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,808
And we should say that the majority of the people who are killed by police every year are white

725
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,672
But if you look at the number of black people were killed and you balance that against

726
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Fact that black people only make up about 12

727
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
70 overall

728
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
Population

729
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
What you end up with

730
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,656
Is that an unarmed black man is

731
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
Roughly about seven times more likely

732
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
To be

733
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,312
Killed by police in an unarmed white man.

734
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Escorting once

735
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Add these numbers

736
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,688
Are very disputed and argued about but what is clear

737
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Is most police officers who use deadly force or never charged in the even smaller percentage serve jail time

738
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
So mad

739
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
Yeah actually let me just ask

740
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,256
All the cases we heard about before the break that Litany of case

741
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,584
For the past few years in every single one of those

742
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,936
The jury was asked did this officer behave like a reasonable officer should

743
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
And every single one the jury said yes

744
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Yeah yeah

745
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Why

746
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
Well that's is because

747
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,688
The reasonable officer standard like from from the moment that it was created

748
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
I was actually kind of a word constrained

749
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
In a few very important ways

750
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
I have here the

751
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
The jury instructions from the 9th circuit

752
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
And this is what dreams members are

753
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
I told to think about when they have to assess this kind of use of force

754
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
Geraci told this is your job

755
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
Go to the bank at 8 Primetime Kelly Prime

756
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
Yeah it says

757
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
Under the Fourth Amendment a police officer may use only such Force as objectively reasonable you must judge the

758
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,504
The reasonableness of a particular use of force from

759
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
The perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene

760
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
And not with 20/20 vision of hindsight

761
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
Those those are a couple really crucial

762
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Phrases with

763
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
Perspective

764
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Of

765
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,192
An officer on the scene so you have to look at it through the eyes of the officer on the scene and then

766
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,520
You can't look at it through the 20/20 vision of hindsight

767
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
Put yourself in the shoes an officer in the moment and look at the world through their eyes and and that's how you have to understand these things

768
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
Where did that where does where did that idea come from to that

769
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,088
Comes from Graham the guy comes from the Chief Justice

770
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
William rehnquist

771
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
Pinyin

772
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Which

773
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Tiebreaker

774
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
The reason why this particular use of force must be judged

775
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
From the perspective of a reasonable officer

776
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
On the scene rather than with the

777
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
The 20/20 vision of hindsight

778
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,032
AP Calculus must embody in allowance for the fact in This Is Us

779
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Swimming party

780
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,640
The police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions

781
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,736
About the amount of force necessary in a particular situation

782
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,088
It so as you can see this this idea of reasonableness is

783
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Circumscribed

784
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
Fairy-type Eevee

785
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
By time

786
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
It's not asking like what a regional officer would do

787
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Herein in general

788
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
During a moment where

789
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Where they have to use Force

790
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Instead

791
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,728
What is asking is what would a reasonable officer do in this split

792
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Second

793
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
In his little tiny sliver of time where the force

794
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
Actually occurred

795
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
In fact that moment legally has come to be known

796
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
As a superseding event

797
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,832
Meaning what what does it mean meaning

798
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Meaning that that that moment

799
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,976
That superseding event it is essentially it breaks

800
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
The

801
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
Chain of causation

802
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,144
So if you think of times just this like Continuous Flow this is like no

803
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
You break that

804
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,264
You stop that and you take this one little moment you pluck it out

805
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,848
And you like this moment this is the one moment that you look at

806
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
That's all they can think

807
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
Read it and it turns out if you ask

808
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
A jury

809
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
The question

810
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
About you Sephora

811
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
That way

812
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
About this one little moment

813
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
The Graham standard many people saw it

814
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
I'm in Hope wood would help victims of police violence

815
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Does the exact opposite

816
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,584
One person might my colleague who covers cops describes it as like cops

817
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,168
Kopsia dislike their first amendment they just think of it like as a shield

818
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Yeah

819
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,056
Okay so this is NPR reporter Kelly mcevers host

820
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080

That most people don't get to see

829
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Assertive

830
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
See how cops

831
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Are actually trained

832
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
To understand grammar

833
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Do you want in

834
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216

Ohio Pennsylvania labor. Super happy about

848
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,647
Angry stares in the beginning there's just like a lot of side eye

849
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Good morning Cleveland

Json whole thing is put on by this company called Calibre press

857
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
It's actually been around for a really long time and they teach classes

858
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,879
Questions are in the police departments are they out from all across the country in this particular one

859
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,415
I want to talk a lot about stress

860
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Survival in

861
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
The general idea is

862
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,583
How to survive and Blake make it to retirement

863
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
Emotional health

864
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Suicide

865
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:50,239
You know how to basically do this job and

866
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
7 survival

867
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
And live

868
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Living

869
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
And lastly

870
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
25/30

871
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,479
They talk a lot about self-care

872
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
About sleep and exercise

873
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Crab your

874
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:13,279
Making sure that your spouse in your family like understand the stress of your job and they talked about going to therapy I mean it's like

875
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Wow there's times when it's this really

876
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Touchy-feely kind of thing

877
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,191
Overwhelmed

878
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Happening

879
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
There's demonology says when a lobster got up

880
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,615
Let's talk about contemplating suicide

881
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
Starting secluding myself

882
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
I started alienating myself

883
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
F****** hating everybody

884
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Everyone

885
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,951
Play crying so I mean it's a really intense

886
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Couple of days

887
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:49,631
But for our purposes the reason we were there the reason we're excited for Kelly be there

888
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
Is it a big chunk of the class

889
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
Let's talk about the

890
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
Is devoted to gram

891
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
Ugly uses Force

892
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
But if you stop

893
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,199
How to understand Grand and and how it impacts their life

894
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:10,111
By the way this is the instructor that like Granite structure his name is Jim Glennon he himself was a cop for years and years and years

895
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,463
Charging ports for 18-year outside of Chicago

896
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,791
I tell you what we talked about a bramber Connor and rru

897
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
On a regular basis

898
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
4 *

899
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Red

900
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
What I would do is show a video and then let's talk about brandriff

901
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Video so

902
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Find a projector

903
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,247
It is really interesting to see these videos from their perspective

904
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
Video of a

905
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,135
September 2015 guy named Freddy centeno

906
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,207
Freddy centeno has gone to a woman's house

907
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
Like a woman's front door

908
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,655
And threatened her and said he has a gun in the cops pull up the other car there's like 20 feet away from centeno who's walking

909
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,495
On the sidewalk

910
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
10 shots

911
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,431
7 mm head

912
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
I translate the white one

913
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,063
Jim's claims it happens in 1.5 6 6

914
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
2nd Swing

915
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,047
Clips that Jim shows the lawyer for Freddy Santana's family

916
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,375
Is BAC just like

917
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,167
Atrocity

918
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,263
Like this was an atrocity nothing about this use of force should be considered reasonable

919
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
Because the cops in the situation they rolled right up on Freddy centeno they didn't create any space didn't give Freddy centeno anytime

920
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
Get on the ground

921
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
Do you have a chance to get on the phone

922
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
One second before the fire

923
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,415
And the video shows the officers did not get a chance to respond to their commands

924
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
Search employees all these reactions

925
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
And then

926
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,327
Play the original body cam video again

927
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,167
See Freddy centeno they tell him to get on the ground he doesn't

928
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,751
An engine slows the video down

929
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
As you can see Santa's right hand

930
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,615
Reaches into his pocket

931
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
Composite

932
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
Things like take a look at this right

933
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Here

934
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Annapolis green gym has it

935
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,415
Frozen moment where you can see that Freddy symptom of hand and started to move

936
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
The movie

937
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,607
Just starting to come up out of his pocket that's moment from the pocket to the out of the pocket this to Jim was the

938
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,655
Moment

939
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:37,055
Seems like this is the only moment that matters like forget what happened before forget that the officers rolled right up on centeno forget that they weren't giving too much time

940
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Space

941
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
This moment

942
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
Right here

943
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,295
Start pulling his hand out of his pocket this is the moment where you ask the question what would a reasonable offer

944
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Street view

945
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Right now

946
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
This man appears to be pulling out

947
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,975
Bach I can't tell what it is you probably can't even without outside in

948
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,815
Turns out he had a a nozzle from a garden hose

949
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
What was the

950
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Malaga

951
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
However you see this

952
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
Start moving up or down

953
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
He doesn't go to the ground

954
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
Pull something out

955
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,847
They think it's a gun any reasonable person

956
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,175
And so

957
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Is this work under gram

958
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
It's sad that but

959
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Yes

960
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
I believe

961
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,559
For him he's just like over and over and over stress is

962
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,399
What would a reasonable police officer do

963
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
In that moment

964
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
What was the

965
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,175
Text about rehnquist in the decision is like what rank was said is

966
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
Split Second

967
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Circumstance

968
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,111
Certain rapidly-evolving about the amount of forces necessary

969
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
This is fast

970
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,303
Dynamic it's nothing like television there's no five cameras on it there's no change in the music there's no upswell in the music

971
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,607
It's fast and the court recognizes

972
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
Albuquerque

973
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:11,263
Chase plays another example this one of the guy

974
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,663
Like I've police officer shot because they thought he had a gun and a knife but the cops got in Call of Duty had a gun and

975
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,991
In the split second he raised his arm like he was raising a gun

976
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,159
Another one

977
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,559
Chanel video of a police officer shooting an unarmed white man in head and again walkthrough beat by beat

978
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
City-Data look at just a moment forget everything else

979
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,727
And what you realize if you do that

980
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,311
Did you force someone to agree to look at

981
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
Just that one moment forgetting everything else just look at this one

982
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
Slice Through The Eyes of an officer

983
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Pinhole contact

984
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
What is reasonable

985
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Ships

986
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:00,159
The only real question you can ask when the moment is so confined is

987
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
Did the officer feels

988
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:08,607
Lake was the fear that that officer had a reasonable fear in that moment

989
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,423
That is a very different standard than what

990
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
Woody and Jerry in the thorn Graham that intended

991
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Yeah

992
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
So

993
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Tele exitos

994
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,639
Story that you reported for podcast embedded

995
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
Alexi gets at some of the stuff

996
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,759
In this particular case who was Jennifer Lynn what happened

997
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
Jonathan Ferrell

998
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
The football player

999
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
From Florida

1000
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,695
Yes he looks like a football player

1001
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:40,095
So this was September of 2013 John Farrell is living in Charlotte North Carolina's black man 24 years old

1002
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,399
And one night it was a Friday night

1003
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
He goes out with some friends goes out to a bar

1004
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,543
Has a couple drinks makes his way home exactly know what happened

1005
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,615
But well John the bear was making his way back home at some point his

1006
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:58,015
Car with lost control of his car crash in the woods office Road in Suburban Charlotte he didn't have his phone

1007
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,159
Buddy's in like this little Suburban neighborhood so he gets out of his car to the house of this woman is knocking on her door

1008
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:09,535
Woman psychiatrist a white woman new mom she comes to the door thinking it's her husband who works nights

1009
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,935
So she's come to the door and she's like about to let him in and then she's like well wait a second who's the person who opens the doors he chosen Ferrell

1010
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Delinquent

1011
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
She calls 911

1012
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
Car Alarm Systems going off and you can hear

1013
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
John girl screaming turn off the alarm turn off the alarm in the background and you can hear him in the 911 tape you can like hear it

1014
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Banging on the door

1015
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,895
I don't know what to do okay I'm right here

1016
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Pressure on our way okay

1017
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,271
Now we don't know why John Farrell was banging on the door but

1018
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Very possible

1019
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:08,159
They likely it was just because he wrecked his car and need some help

1020
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
So they called

1021
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,047
Thinking that they are going to the scene of a breaking and entering

1022
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:20,447
Music asking video from the squad car 20 officers they've gotten a description it's an African American man with green shirt and light pay

1023
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,799
Since officers driving down this road driving driving driving until finally you see

1024
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,127
Connect man's green shirt and white pants walking on the side of the road

1025
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,247
Walking towards the squad cars you see the red light of a taser on his chest

1026
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,295
And then

1027
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
Take off one of your officers is yelling at me get on the ground. Keeps running runs off camera

1028
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:48,095
If you have sex with them

1029
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
Running upstairs fire 12 shots

1030
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Heavenstrike John Farrell

1031
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,847
Foster ground

1032
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
Bumbu

1033
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Any dyes

1034
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,903
Or that here's a guy who was unarmed who did nothing wrong

1035
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
And he was killed

1036
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,975
Like plain and simple if you

1037
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,047
You asked was that reasonable on some basic level

1038
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
No

1039
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
It was not reasonable this man

1040
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
Should not have died

1041
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,983
What in the trial this case did go to a trial jury trial

1042
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,823
The jury was instructed forget everything but that moment of force

1043
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,151
Looks like no 20-20 hindsight look at just a superseding moment

1044
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
And then ask the question again

1045
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,015
Was it reasonable for the officer to pull the trigger

1046
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
Ie

1047
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,623
Was it reasonable for that officer to be afraid

1048
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
And the officer who shot and killed Jonathan Ferrell

1049
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
Who's facing charges his name is Randall Kerrick

1050
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,399
You've been tried for voluntary manslaughter

1051
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
Begin aggressively coming towards me

1052
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
Entering courses triops

1053
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,823
The character cast and could you tell the jury about

1054
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
What pace he was coming at you

1055
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,455
At first it was a pretty rapid pace

1056
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
More and more of a fast walk

1057
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
I gave loud verbal commands

1058
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,879
Stream stop and get on the ground

1059
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
How loud are your verbal commands

1060
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
Very loud

1061
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,863
Tell me how loud you were yelling to the suspect and what you were yelling to the suspect

1062
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
So

1063
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,263
He says he was running at him

1064
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
Misses a huge question

1065
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,359
Was he running Adam

1066
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Really running away from

1067
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,199
I tried to run past them by him yeah

1068
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,783
Like if you sort of diagram the whole thing out the way the cop cars were

1069
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Parks and Rec characters

1070
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Standing

1071
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
It is possible

1072
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:53,279
The Jonathan fair was trying to start a run between the mall at the prosecution masane defense was like no no no he was running at the

1073
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
The cops didn't suspect

1074
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
Say anything

1075
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Nasir

1076
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,423
Why did you interpret his

1077
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
Body language to me

1078
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
He's going to attack me

1079
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,871
He's going to assault me he's going to take my gun from me

1080
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
Did you have time to holster your weapon

1081
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
No sir

1082
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
And here I was

1083
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
Suspect match the description

1084
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,183
He just ran through a taser

1085
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,231
Which at the time I thought was

1086
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Had that work

1087
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
I thought the taser had struck

1088
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
Make contact

1089
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,167
I had absolutely no idea if he had a weapon on him or not

1090
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
And

1091
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,495
What's the average dick was the suspect ever still

1092
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
No sir

1093
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,615
Did he continue to advance on you

1094
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Yes sir

1095
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
No matter what I did he wouldn't stop

1096
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
I wasn't sure how many rounds I had fired none of them affected him and anyway anyway I didn't think my gun was working

1097
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
I thought I was going to die

1098
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
There's nothing I would do to stop it

1099
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,559
What was the reason that you continue to fire your weapon

1100
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,863
Because he wouldn't stop

1101
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
People trying to get to my gun

1102
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
Toilet down the question was

1103
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
Was it reasonable for officer character

1104
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
Feel afraid

1105
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
And after 11 days of testimony the question was put to the jury

1106
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,295
There were six opinions one way there were six another

1107
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Text to sex

1108
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,415
On one side a white guy named Bruce Raffi

1109
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
And we were sitting in that dreary

1110
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Deliberation room has no bigger than this living room

1111
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Okay

1112
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
And

1113
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
It's hot

1114
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,375
We're arguing where it's

1115
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,911
It's it's going nowhere

1116
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
And so the more it went on this went on for days

1117
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,287
And he started the leading the charge on that we have to acquit carrack

1118
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,871
Felted officer care can it be right to be afraid

1119
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:50,271
And he told Kelly that Jonathan Ferrell the guy that shot so what Bruce Rafi sang to me like you know he was a young man

1120
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Disheveled confused

1121
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
Angry

1122
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,183
If you will be made a very aggressive move towards police officer

1123
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,975
After disobeying commands

1124
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
How many choices in this video

1125
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
And it was clear from the very first time I viewed it

1126
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
Stop sit down

1127
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Put your hands up

1128
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
Do any of those things

1129
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,983
Other than what you chose to do which was Ted charged

1130
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Lobster care

1131
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,591
And told that there's no other way around what I saw

1132
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
And then I kept coming back to that

1133
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,479
And this is exactly how the defense painted it right this case is not about race

1134
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
Viskase

1135
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
Is about choices

1136
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,159
And that's stuck in grease trap he's mine so that when he was asked was it reasonable for character shoot him

1137
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
Johnsonville made all these bad choice

1138
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
This is an old trick

1139
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
From from

1140
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
From my defense attorneys

1141
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:42,495
Kelly spoke to Moses Wilson and African-American man he wasn't supposed to be

1142
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
He might have had a few drinks where he was

1143
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,663
The police responded to what he calls

1144
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
This was early in the morning

1145
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,295
This was far from where he lived

1146
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
This was this

1147
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
This was that

1148
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
Which caused me

1149
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
At the end

1150
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,743
To write on the board

1151
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
Just what did he do

1152
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
To deserve to be shot so many times

1153
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,167
Mystery Room

1154
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
In the Jury Room

1155
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
I wrote this on the board

1156
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
What did he

1157
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
Do

1158
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
What's the what happens with the jury

1159
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Split

1160
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,319
Bunch of Italians eat to quit Ford convicted

1161
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,623
8 jurors most of them Wayside with

1162
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
Quitting Cara

1163
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,463
And for jurors most of them people of color

1164
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
Side with Conviction characters

1165
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Breaking news

1166
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,351
In the trial of Officer Randall Kerrick the judge

1167
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,911
Has just declared a mistrial

1168
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,263
2015 St Charlotte settle the lawsuit which on the Pharaohs family

1169
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,823
2.25 million dollars

1170
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
Roulette same here optic Eric resign from the Charlotte

1171
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Police Department

1172
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,783
The city paid out $179,989.59

1173
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
The money was

1174
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Backpage hair accessories

1175
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
Security and retirement

1176
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
An attorney representing them in a separate civil suit

1177
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
There's something interesting about

1178
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,583
Listening to Moses talk just what did he do

1179
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,167
To deserve to be shot so many times it feels like

1180
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
This time

1181
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
Fourth Amendment reasonableness

1182
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Standard this reasonable officer

1183
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
Standard like what

1184
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,127
Understand is that it was an attempt to really

1185
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
Look at these situations these shootings

1186
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
Uses of force cases

1187
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:36,671
Through this sort of objective lens where you're just looking at all the fat guy on the ground

1188
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
And yet

1189
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:45,119
Kisses don't seem to be tied it like any sort of objectivity or you're like oh that's actually like

1190
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,703
That feels like a pier sort of objectivity

1191
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,775
Like what what what has this guy done yet

1192
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
Actually done any

1193
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,847
He ran it a buddy

1194
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Maybe

1195
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
But that was

1196
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
It

1197
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
And

1198
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,807
Like if you're white

1199
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,719
Are you more likely to say yes that was reasonable because he's white and he was afraid of a black man

1200
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
Like that is the question

1201
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,423
Given the history of our country I'd say many cases that's not even a

1202
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
Thanks question I'm actually left with is

1203
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,847
If this is where the reasonableness standard is

1204
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Is lettuce

1205
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Is there another standard

1206
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
I think that's right

1207
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:35,295
This is what he can at again he represented the thorn Graham in that original case

1208
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
When You See It applied you wonder

1209
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,719
Whether or not this is the best and her there might be something better

1210
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,047
I just don't have an answer to that

1211
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,119
I would I would suggest the whole more radical

1212
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,751
Is Elie mystal more perfect legal editor we ended up talking with him about this

1213
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Shortly after

1214
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,871
The philando Castile verdict came out so he was

1215
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:05,759
Well that was a tough pill for him and many people swallow I would suggest that they have to be

1216
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,063
The cops have to be right in fact

1217
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
Which is something we usually do not apply for what does that mean like it from in the scenario of a police person woo-hoos

1218
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,095
Is that mean like I need to be right that you don't have a toy gun that that's to me

1219
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,167
So if you shoot me because you think I have a gun I had best have a

1220
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
And if I don't have a gun your ass is going to jail

1221
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Cuz you were wrong

1222
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,799
I don't care if you only thought so

1223
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,335
If I was telling you had a gun

1224
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,871
If I if you are not

1225
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Write in

1226
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Back then you

1227
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Have to go to jail

1228
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,247
I think that is that would be a standard

1229
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
Sterile hours to process

1230
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
Cute Beast Boy

1231
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:45,951
Cinepolis person's going to just going to argue that like you don't understand the pressures that are under it's a Split Second

1232
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Decision

1233
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,511
Monday morning quarterbacking if you

1234
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,815
You do what you just said we're not going to be able to do our jobs

1235
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
I'm sick of you

1236
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,423
I would say screw you if you have had your chance

1237
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
You had your chance

1238
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
To police my community

1239
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
Without murdering us

1240
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
And you have failed for 300 years

1241
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
That's what I was saying

1242
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,735
More people might get hurt if I wasn't

1243
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
I'm willing to risk that

1244
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,063
I'm willing to try it that way then

1245
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
I'd rather I'd rather

1246
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
10

1247
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,999
Illegal shoplifting people

1248
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Go free

1249
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Then one

1250
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,655
Illegal shoplifting person gets shot in the street like an animal

1251
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Kesha

1252
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,007
If you want to talk about changing the standards that is a standard change

1253
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,335
Now that is a zelle said

1254
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Radical

1255
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
Probably not real

1256
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
Given that most Americans according to polls

1257
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Respectively

1258
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,367
I have confidence in the please proceed please to be the enforcers

1259
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
HIPAA law

1260
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
But

1261
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
There are other ideas

1262
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
Out there they're starting

1263
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Bubble up

1264
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,559
And it was constraining us if what's keeping us

1265
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,119
Stuck where we are are the words of Graham

1266
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,423
Then what offers does a way out

1267
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
Could actually

1268
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,495
Also be hiding in there

1269
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
What do you mean

1270
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
Okay so you know how

1271
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,663
Chief justice rehnquist when he wrote the decision in 89

1272
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:16,063
He put in all these phrases that took the idea of a regional officer and unconstrained it right

1273
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,111
These were like

1274
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,415
Constraint only two

1275
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:25,791
This little moment in time it's been trained to the perspective of the officers or constrained that there's no 20-20 hindsight

1276
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
All that stuff

1277
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,911
What in the decision he also he's slipped in this other phrase

1278
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,239
He's actually calling back to an earlier decision

1279
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,031
And what he wrote was

1280
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:43,967
The question is whether the totality of circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure

1281
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,503
Totality of circumstance

1282
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,879
Totality of circumstances which seems to be at odds with all of the other stuff

1283
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
Right which is all about like little slivers and moment

1284
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,399
Suggesting that this is like this is the whole thing

1285
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
Both both ideas and their wants yet which is why right now you see the lower courts are arguing

1286
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
About what this phrase actually means until half of the circuits are saying kind of like everything that we've already talked about witches

1287
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,271
Is that all the totality circumstances means is that

1288
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:24,927
You look at everything to answer the question was the officer's scared you look at everything that the officer would have known

1289
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,071
Known everything the officer would have seen received and then you ask okay knowing all that was a reason for the awesome music

1290
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
In the moment

1291
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
The other half of the circuit a

1292
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Natalia circumstances

1293
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,751
Isn't just about what the officer knew what the officer

1294
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
I saw and how it answers the moment

1295
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,591
Fatality means like totality

1296
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
Like what did the officer

1297
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Do

1298
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
Leading up to the mall

1299
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,223
Did the officer

1300
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:52,831
Try to get a search warrant to the officer try to deescalate the situation before

1301
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:59,231
Are using voice to be officer try to subdue the person before using deadly force it's only all those things that usual

1302
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Out of the frame

1303
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Maybe

1304
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,863
Can be let back in

1305
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:11,775
Supreme Court so far has shown no interest in ruling on this in trying to sort this out

1306
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
But they might

1307
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:17,151
Because the argument is happening in the lower courts

1308
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:24,063
So in a way we're kind of living at a time very much like 1984 when does Lauren Graham.

1309
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
Pulled over outside of convenience store in Charlotte

1310
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,463
Waiting to see whether it matters that the thorn Graham

1311
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
Wasn't trying to steal anything

1312
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
Maybe just a diabetic

1313
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
Chinese Mauritius

1314
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,823
Did what happened your dad affect how you

1315
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Thought of

1316
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
Police how you spell police

1317
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
Bean bean black man

1318
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Well

1319
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
You don't believe it or not

1320
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
It didn't

1321
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
What's up

1322
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
I like the base my

1323
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,207
Opinions based on my own

1324
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
Experiences

1325
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
My dad

1326
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
I can say this Kelly

1327
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Matt

1328
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,143
I can remember my dad telling me

1329
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
Stories of

1330
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,751
Where he grew up in eastern North Carolina

1331
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
On a tobacco farm

1332
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
In that small town

1333
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,127
I can remember him telling me a story of

1334
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,663
A black man

1335
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Who have been accused

1336
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
Being inappropriate with a white woman

1337
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
And how the white

1338
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
Got him in broad daylight

1339
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
Castrated him in broad daylight

1340
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
And I say that

1341
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
In saying that

1342
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,423
Although he experienced all that stuff growing up

1343
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,239
And the racism that he experienced growing up

1344
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,799
He didn't teach that to us

1345
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
He didn't teach that has he told us

1346
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,127
To love people

1347
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
People

1348
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
So

1349
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
Even now my

1350
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Cell

1351
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,783
I base my experience of a person

1352
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
I base my experience of the

1353
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
The police

1354
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,391
Based on my dealings with

1355
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
In and not that I want

1356
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
But I have yet

1357
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
To encounter

1358
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,583
A police officer who's been mean to me who's been rude to me

1359
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,119
Who's mistreated me

1360
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
And that's the God's honest truth

1361
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,239
Without a button in being completely honest

1362
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,287
When I see you on the news

1363
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,847
Like a kid in the 12 year old in

1364
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
It had to be begun

1365
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,455
Raci

1366
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
Examples like this

1367
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
That

1368
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
That that does affect mean that does

1369
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,671
Make me does that make you think of your own children if you talk to your own tears

1370
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,463
Course I've got a twelve-year-old home

1371
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,535
He's got BB guns that look just like real guns

1372
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,607
And you know what he he knows that

1373
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Hey

1374
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
They don't leave the house

1375
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,959
What's it what's your twelve-year-old name

1376
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
My son's name is Tanner

1377
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Tanner

1378
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
And when you when you talk to Tanner about

1379
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,687
The fact that like the BB gun doesn't leave the house I mean what is that conversation

1380
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
Tamir rice when he was shot

1381
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:05,343
Concealed when the new story came on by pause it and cuz you need to do with live TV now

1382
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
Say come here

1383
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Why don't you watch this

1384
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,951
Right now tan is 12 years old he's

1385
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
Cuties this is that

1386
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,791
But the fact of the matter is

1387
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
In a few

1388
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
Few short years

1389
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
He would be considered a black man

1390
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
Unfortunately

1391
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,495
He's going to have

1392
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
Target online

1393
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Himself

1394
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
So

1395
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,151
St. Louis BB guns you got see this is why you can't take these

1396
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
Out of the house I don't want you

1397
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
You take these on the house

1398
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,527
Even if you're outside in the yard playing

1399
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,087
In a police should happen to come down the road at 8

1400
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Drop it

1401
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Drop it immediately
