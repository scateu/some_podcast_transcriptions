30
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,952
Hey what are your feelings as you approach this date

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
It's a weird

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Time is it

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Citing it's exciting because like my kid was born here so my kid is an American citizen but I'm not an American citizen that's kind of

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Like a weird thing like I feel like I want to be that for my kid I feel like

35
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
As a

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Muslim guy

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,200
There are protections that I get as a citizen that I buy me not otherwise yet

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
But I mean like for my family my family is

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
We've immigrated a lot my

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208
Like two maybe three generations ago my family moved

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
From India

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
2 East Africa

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Tanzania

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
And then my parents generation they emigrated from Tanzania

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Canada

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
But what's funny is like my family my dad

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
My mom like when they came to Canada

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,664
They were so grateful that Canada

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Accepted them

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,272
My parents so badly wanted to be Canadians

51
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
But because they were sort of these Outsiders date

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,952
They kept coming really close would like not quite getting it like my dad

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
She knew like as a comedian dad the thing you're supposed to do is like go down to the ice rink in sign up your boyfriend

54
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Hockey lessons

55
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
But instead she signed me up for figure skating lessons until like 3 years I took figure skate

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,128
Reading glasses that was like the only Brown kid in the class only brown boy

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Did you guys watch hockey

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
Yeah I know what's the thing with hockey like in Canada hockey

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Such a thing but for me when I was in high school I would go home I would like to do my homework really quickly

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,024
And then I would watch Hockey Night in Canada and I hated hockey but I would watch it

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Because I knew the next day at school like that's all anybody would be talking about is the Maple Leafs game it was

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Was like a like a simulation homework there's something you know he's like okay like let's memorize the names of these players OK Google who scored

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,896
Vertigo always a good girl with an interesting call like where's Tupac Back

64
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
I don't even can't even

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
You know it's like there's this club and this is the homework for the club and in order to be part of the club

66
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
I have to do the homework

67
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,696
And for everybody else the homework is fun and for me the homework is homework

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
So here at the show for the last

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
I don't know 6 months a year

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
Whatever since a lot of theater show about voting and elections

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
You know we've been thinking about

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Democracy and citizenship is Big sort of amorphous concept

73
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
I'm trying to figure out how

74
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
How do we

75
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,392
Make something about them it's hard though because Big Ideas

76
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
I'm mushy and hard to pee

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Down

78
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Yes we would have kind of lie for a bit but then

79
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
2 of a reporter

80
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Walked in with

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
Stories that really brought those big fuzzy ideas down to earth

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
So for the next

83
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,847
New episodes in the world

84
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
About what it means and what it takes

85
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
To belong to a boy

86
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,975
Starting with Kelly Prime with a story that takes place

87
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Probably know this by now

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535

90
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Found

91
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
This

92
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Kind of viral article to hit all over the world

93
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
That was

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
Dutch woman too annoying to get Swiss citizenship

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
And it's a good title

96
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
So there's this woman Nancy Holten

97
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
And from what I could read just on the very like click baby stuff was that

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
She is a vocal vegan

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
Cheap anti cowbell anti church bell in the town turned against her

100
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
Refuse to naturalize her to Auntie cowbell cowbells like why would why would you do things in the world

101
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,399
World's like you go to Switzerland and on every postcard is this like

Giant decorative Bell on its chest and that is like

105
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079

106
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,943
In this lady Nancy who's like a militant animal rights person she says that the loudness

00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
For the cows that it is

108
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,087
Disturbing for them and it is cruel and that it is a Swiss tradition but it's got to go

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367

I don't eat babies do you kind of like over-the-top a self-righteous right

112
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
But

113
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,007
The idea that a town could deny her citizenship

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Like being annoying for her personality is Anjali

115
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407

Into the Swiss Countryside

123
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
We just drove in a cornfield deposit actor

124
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
I think we're here

125
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
After about an hour we got to the town where Nancy lives

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919

On the first day of school she couldn't speak any German all and apparently his teacher asked her to open up a window so defensive

212
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007

00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
So she was living outside of Zurich

239
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
And she already had a 3 year old daughter she was

00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,815
She just had to sign a form but all of a sudden she said I had enough stuff and that's with no stuff

247
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
One night

248
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Just let me sleep one night

249
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
And she says she's

250
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Stood up

251
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775

Coming out of Goodfellas

256
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
And she said no I'm not going to do it that's where she said

257
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
She got the

258
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
The strength from the senate for your kids and set up for yourself

259
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
That's when Nancy says all these things

260
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
That she felt all her life

261
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
About barefoot walking

262
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
And not eating meat and

263
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
Pressing a spiritual connection to the natural world

264
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
She had kept all those things inside of her

265
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
And now she was going to let them out she was going to fight for them

266
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
And years later

267
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
She moved to gift over 4

268
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415

Fantasy Association

270
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
She fell in love with a

271
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
She said she

272
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Never loved anyone like this

273
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,631
And it's the most idyllic beautiful place in the world that's why I'm too many kids in the house

274
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
About for me

275
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
This is my home

277
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
I'm staying here

278
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,359
Because living here she was just able to be so much closer to Nature

279
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
She took us

280
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
To the stream by her house

281
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Milwaukee this cold

282
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
What grass is lightly raining and

283
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
So

284
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
And as we were walking

285
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Down

286
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
This little embankment to put our feet in the water

287
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Cccomm

288
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Popeyes

289
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Whenever you feel like how this whole thing is

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Starting to work

291
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,775
If you were getting a little warm but you have the goalie sensation throughout your buddy

292
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Tia Vine

293
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Act like

294
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Sweety professional

295
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Shattuck Naga Trinity

296
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
If it's raining

297
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
And she was like when the sunshine

298
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
This place is

299
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
It's my heaven on Earth

300
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
This is Timmy Chang Minecraft plus

301
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Display

302
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,095
Her place of strength of flowing water carries away all the

303
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Worries and Sorrows end

304
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Concerta strengths

305
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
And at this point Nancy feels like she's found her voice and she's found her home and she wants to make it official if she wants to be

306
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Bswift

307
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Because

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
She just hadn't gotten her citizenship

309
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Before and like

310
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,855
Her kids are Swiss she wants to be politically active she wants to be able to vote

311
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,439
And the process for citizenship in Switzerland is pretty intense

312
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Yes you are

313
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Tesla paperwork Language exam

314
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
But the final step for Nancy is

315
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
That the town gets to vote

316
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
We're literally

317
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
The town is mailed little pamphlets

318
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
And those templates have

319
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Someone like Nancy Holten

320
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
And a little seedy about her

321
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,663
Forever into town can read her basic biographical information

322
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
Come to the town meeting on the set day at the school gymnasium

323
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
And

324
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
Raise their hand or whether or not she gets to be sweat

325
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
No kidding and so at the end of the day it's a

326
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
It's very public kind of like

327
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Consensus

328
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
And that's

329
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Where are the trouble started

330
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Because Nancy had some ideas about

331
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
How the town might be

332
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Improved

333
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Starting with

334
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
The church bells

335
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
B&D Savannah

336
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
On top and talk to Max

337
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Zexal Morgan

338
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
She said when she moved into apartment she just noticed that

339
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
The church bells in her town because she began to side

340
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,671
Woodring really early in the morning instead klimas me cows in bed

341
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
And they wake her up what do you think

342
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
Good morning

343
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
At 6 in the morning get heavy

344
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Because then I'm waking up

345
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
And I'm also I can't sleep with eyes open

346
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Window image

347
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Keeping room

348
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,615
So Nancy filed a formal complaint

349
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
The nine angles

350
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,527
Boosie wrote a letter to the to the municipality

351
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
Asking for it

352
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Can O2 stop

353
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Basically just looking moms Einstein

354
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
The reason the bells ring in the morning it's not really just about announcing time and there's actually a pretty long Christian

355
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Tradition in the community

356
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Alpha wolf

357
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Sexual Morgan

358
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
It's like it to call for prayer

359
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
Which she considers outdated in Spanish

360
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,895
And it's right at fire religion on this Metheny

361
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
It's going bad

362
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
This is like look

363
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,295
I got free religion and I do not want to be woken up in the morning to pray

364
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Lamb

365
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
Aziz article the national

366
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
The local paper found out about Nancy's complain

367
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
You basically told him about it

368
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
And when article came out that's when the town started talking

369
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
From the beginning it was like so much of gossip

370
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
End up going around the town and

371
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,687
Kind of talk to people about Nancy it's like a pretty small town like

372
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
I think 3,000 people are so and

373
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
One of the people who agreed

374
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Talk to me

375
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Was Andy

376
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
My name is Andy Andreas

377
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
Disturbing

378
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
I grew up in this

379
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,815
Send us a village here his family's actually been in dip over fix for

380
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Three generation

381
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,679
I'm just right from here and he told me that after the church bell article

382
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
People with

383
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
At the pub

384
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Soccer practice or

385
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
Choir around you have a beer

386
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
And you start talking to you

387
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
A little while later

388
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
Take another beer

389
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,735
And a penis get a Little Bit Stronger you know what I mean

390
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
So I think they are

391
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
People would start talking about her

392
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
They have you have you heard or have you read or have you seen

393
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
She doesn't like Bells

394
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
DuckTales

395
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
In the morning why does she rent an apartment besides the church

396
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
This is Ursula

397
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
I'm Swiss

398
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
I talked to her and her husband Max

399
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
My name is Max

400
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
I have

401
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
Steve four-and-a-half-year

402
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,431
And some of their complaints I honestly felt were very reasonable if you decide

403
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
To go to an apartment

404
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
And you choose your apartment beside the street

405
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Don't wonder if their cars

406
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
And if you decide to

407
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
Take your apartment beside the church

408
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
Don't want to talk to her belly

409
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Soba town

410
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:48,703
Was starting to like notice her and get mad at her and people would yell things are Haram to his biking

411
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
Oh wow so it became like okay

412
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
Partly because it wasn't just the church bells

413
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,967
Nancy Ajram making noise about a lot of things here and get over sleeps at a time

414
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
Jaundice and India most expensive

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
It is a tradition in Uber

416
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Big frog samples she had complained about this one tradition where townspeople can bring mice tails to the town hall

417
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Once a year

418
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
People can bring like the Tails of mice

419
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,679
To the town hall and you will get like one Frank and

420
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
$0.10 m

421
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
It's like population control I think originally yes

422
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Legos back like

423
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
A hundred years hundred fifty years ago

424
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Now it's a tradition

425
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
So Nancy went after that

426
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Oh what a

427
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
So she started the procedure was like writing letters to the municipality and to all sorts of like

428
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Animal rights groups

429
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
She got an article in the

430
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
Paper at one point she showed me

431
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
And there was a

432
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Horrific bundle of tales

433
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,799
Nancy's real thing more than the church bells is like animal active

434
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,431
In fact just a little while after that church bells article came out on TV

435
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Come down and turn a list.

436
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,367
Hawkmoon of the reporters asked her team does indigenous Canada

437
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,695
We don't like church bells are there any other bills you don't like

438
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
And she's badass t-shirts women

439
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
Googlem

440
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,495
Well yeah how about this is literally this is

441
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,615
Any other don't you don't like them it's happy K9 best in this Crystal

442
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Constant can be made in Villa d'Este

443
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
I kicked the Hornet's Nest and that's when it all

444
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
So it sounds like she's

445
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
They never ever ever graduated escalation of

446
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Attacks on Swiss culture

447
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Suddenly trips the big one

448
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
The commander-in-chief

449
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Easton

450
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:01,823
Now I have to say I didn't totally get why cowbells would be the Tipping Point

451
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
And I mentioned this to Andy

452
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
The cowbells are an image of

453
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:12,575
Romantic feelings in in Swiss culture

454
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,952
Drive up into the hills around get so perfect with Andy and his daughter Olivia

455
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Pikachu

456
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
With end of the day we parked the car

457
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
You pulled into the

458
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
Long driveway leading to a farm

459
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,592
And we thought

460
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
Six seven eight nine ten

461
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,552
Cows in what very quickly became clear to me in that moment is that cowbells in Switzerland

462
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
2310

463
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,696
Aren't just about postcards or with a selling a gift shop or whatever

464
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
31 cows

465
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
And

466
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Good morning baby

467
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
I really like it here and get the sunset like there's two stunts

468
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Touching a

469
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
Touching all those fields

470
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Such as beautiful

471
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
They really represent this particular way of life in Switzer

472
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Agrarian way of life

473
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
A real simpler farming way of life

474
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
It's like the cowbell is attached

475
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
To the Swiss version of the American Heartland like

476
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Nebraska farmer

477
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
I don't know

478
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,824
And in Switzerland for a lot of people

479
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
That feeling is connected to

480
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,736
Cowbell I think you know also ID for example

481
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
It's a story about a Swiss girl growing up with their grandfather in the alley

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
Everything gets like

483
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
Like the beautiful lies in the Alps and Ukraine

484
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Milk and Peoria cafe

485
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Cheeks

486
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Cowbells are there

487
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
It's some kind of a stereo type of

488
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
A society where there are no problems

489
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Everything Is Beautiful or the sun is shining

490
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,272
Please make every little boy and girl in the world is happy as I am

491
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Heidi

492
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
Hi

493
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Dynavision

494
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
So when Nancy

495
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Lake launch an attack

496
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
That was like

497
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Do you think it felt like it was like attacking

498
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
People sense of well-being and

499
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
Absolutely Santa Clara ocean of War

500
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
I'm coming coming to a 4-inch

501
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Country

502
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I first have to look how

503
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
And then I have to pay

504
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
The choice

505
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Is that okay for me

506
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,088
Or maybe it's not okay for me I'm coming in until you you have to lifelike

507
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
I think

508
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Yes

509
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
This is Ursula Knox again

510
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
It's not okay

511
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,376
Nancy comes in and tells

512
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
That's how we have to

513
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
To do it

514
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
She's suffering person

515
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
She will tell us how to live concerts

516
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay

517
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
Do you remember how you felt before your meeting

518
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:22,272
It made me feel so people in the town are not happy about Nancy's cowbell stance

519
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,624
And in the midst of all this the night of Nancy's citizenship meeting arrives

520
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,976
. device is really

521
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
She's glad that she didn't know what she

522
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,608
She didn't know then what you know today as far

523
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Hardcore like the whole thing with

524
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Hardcore

525
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Describe

526
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
It takes an effort to go back

527
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Particular night

528
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,784
The teeth

529
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,416
Tonight is Nancy citizenship meeting she shows up at the school gymnasium it's in the evening

530
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,560
There are rows and rows of folding chair setup and there's one round the back where the prospective citizens can sit

531
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
So Nancy walks and she sits in that back row

532
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
And I'll say these meetings are usually like

533
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,032
Calm and pretty sparsely attended there's like maybe eighty to a hundred people

534
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
But this time there was

535
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Twice that

536
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
The place was packed

537
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
And

538
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
The first thing to happen is they go through some administrative stuff like

539
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:30,368
How much budget are we going to use to fix the rotor like should we put a roof on the roller hockey rink

540
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,184
But then came the citizenship part of the meeting

541
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
I think they couldn't really control himself

542
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
The townspeople just like

543
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
China lost their cool people like like

544
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
Peasant Farmers they would stand up and able

545
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Get angry and say Well that's

546
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,288
It's not right if you're against it and then

547
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
The things that were said

548
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,664
Really surprisingly violence

549
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
They would get so emotional

550
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
I'm in the disgusting

551
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
I'd almost there was a very hateful

552
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:07,488

Alex heeringa fabric

554
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
I was astonished about them

555
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Power off

556
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
Saying no

557
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
We don't want

558
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,312
Getting off yelling saying she doesn't belong here for me

559
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
It was a shame

560
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
And he got up at one point

561
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,736
To speak on her behalf then I spoke and the

562
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
How about them

563
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
It was

564
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
We did not have any chance

565
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
Inconsolate out loud

566
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Stock

567
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
I was skipping

568
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,304
And apparently the whole room just started booing him

569
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,936
Inconstant hambu and Nancy is there for Olive

570
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,520
Best listening to everything people are saying just sitting quietly in the back

571

573
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,784
At this point in the assembly people start speaking out against Nancy accuser of the muscle

574
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,648

Below the belt

578
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,848
And this whole time her daughters are sitting right there next

579
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
At this point Nancy's asked to leave the room

580
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
She goes out with her daughters

581
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,016
Stands behind his big double doors

582
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
She waits

583
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
And then she hears

584
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
How to eat an apple house

587
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
So

588
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Having it so obviously

589
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Having a room full of

590
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
People

591
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
Dority's really not on your side is

592
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680

593
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216

It's the cover photo is a field of cows with Nancy's face photoshop on it and it's got

00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
A big circle and

600
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
Some of the comments on there like

601
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
She should eat me for once

602
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
Come to her senses

603
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
In the old days

604
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
Which would have been chased away with a dung for

605
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
Such women were burnt at the stake as witches

606
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

621
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
And I'm here because I need your help

622
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
This summer

623
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,904
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

624
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
Aunts and uncles teachers

625
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
We're looking for stories about what we're calling

626
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
Basically I want to hear about this

627
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
I kid you know did something

628
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
It just means you lean back and say

629
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Wow

630
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,104
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

631
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Back to you

632
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

633
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Or maybe the kids in math

634
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,648
Music in the margin of their geometry

635
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
We're interested in the

636
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
Specific moments where

637
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

638
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
If you have a story

639
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
Go to radiolab.org

640
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Flash brilliance

641
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
Record a short audio message

642
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
And that's radiolab.org.

643
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Thank you so much

646
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,168
Yeah assume that this is not the end of Nancy

647
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Nancy's tailor

648
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
No nothing

649
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
I mean the meeting was like pretty awful for Nancy

650
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
You know her daughters are Super C

651
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
Supportive socks mama

652
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
The best chewing tobacco

653
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
They're like

654
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
You can't give up Mom you need to do this

655
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
That because I feel okay to myself

656
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Ons

657
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
And what she did was

658
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,072
She wrote to the Canton official the Canton is like the region

659
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
And

660
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
She wrote to them asking for another try

661
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,472
And she sprayed the stationary with perfume

662
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
Let me hear Coco

663
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
It was Vanilla cocoa

664
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
Cruelty free vanilla perfume

665
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
From the body shop that doesn't

666
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Do animal testing

667
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:58,208
Give it a little bit of her Flair and the response was good they said okay you can try again did you think about

668
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
Stopping your campaigns against the specifically Swiss

669
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
You know cowbells

670
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Church bells

671
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
I just feel like if it were me

672
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
I would probably

673
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
Things like other so many ways to help animals

674
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,520
Maybe I would try to choose one that

675
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,616
Doesn't cost much friction in my community without ever thought like maybe

676
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Something not

677
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
About the cows in the churches

678
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Never

679
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
As-salaam Aditya

680
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
She's like as long as the animals need a voice

681
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm going to continue

682
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
Is water-methanol bigly

683
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Exact

684
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Nancy

685
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,536
Google and her family during this week's a Nancy

686
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Keep it down

687
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
If you're Nancy

688
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,936
She said that would be honest it wouldn't be me and I don't want to

689
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
Ganache Collision

690
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
Cross someone's ass

691
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,384
How do you say that how do I put this

692
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Yeah

693
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,784
And by this point

694
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Slow-cook Rita Morgan

695
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,928
The media has gotten hold of Nancy story and things just

696
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Harga

697
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376
Writing and posting about the cowbells and telling people that

698
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,520
Shouldn't eat meat

699
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,360
Is a Buick Enclave

700
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
Pacific rear I use this Fame in order to reach even more people on TV protesting

701
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:32,160
The Graces and

702
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
Is the use of animals in circuses

703
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
Since the price was involved everything change

704
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
Anywhere in Switzerland Where You Are

705
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
And you excited

706
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,320
Infographics

707
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
The Ultimate Salon

708
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,976
So along the way all these articles about Nancy they end up putting a spotlight on the town too

709
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,816
A village bus machine from the outside as being

710
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Oh because I make you feel

711
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Fairy

712
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
2 years.

713
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
I think this will see the anger that was formulated

714
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,336
At this point Nancy goes in for her second vote

715
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,920
And this time she actually bakes vegan gingerbread to give out around town

716
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
And the town rejects her

717
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Again

718
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Which again

719
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
Picks up the media

720
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Telophase

721
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,768
Unforgettable lyrics

722
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
What's the time

723
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
A left-wing Dutch woman has been tinnitus with passport

724
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Because she's annoying

725
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
It goes International

726
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
And she even end up

727
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,080
In a joke on the bluff The Listener test

728
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,872
On wait wait don't tell me

729
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
It's tough

730
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
How to get the Swiss

731
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
To take aside

732
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Even the Nazis couldn't do it

733
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
But when it came to 42 year old man

734
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Beholden they couldn't help but

735
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Take a stand

736
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
She's that annoying

737
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,256
She's a pain in the ass as a person

738
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
I'm sorry

739
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Yes you can

740
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
Pain in the ass

741
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,288
So I was in the area I stopped by a local newspaper

742
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,616
And I met with this reporter and nausea and an editor Roth

743
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
And of course they knew all about Nancy Holten people enter that you know the hatred that they have

744
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,600
Who's kaivac breeders in the valley of

745
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Breakers coming from they say

746
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,048
If I have to read one more story about that her I will cancel my subscription button

747
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Critical story

748
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,376
So the reason Ross said

749
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
It's a critical story is because

750
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,496
It's not so much a story about weather

751
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,848
Nancy's well-liked or not whether she's annoying or not it's more about

752
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Who gets to decide

753
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Who can be Swiss

754
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
And who cannot

755
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Anna from us perspective

756
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
May be hard to

757
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,832
Kind of wrap your head around the fact that there's so much

758
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
Kind of local autonomy to make these kinds of decisions but

759
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
I think that there's just a very strong tradition in Switzerland

760
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
Yunnan local matters and they should be

761
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Delta waves in the local community

762
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
So this is professor of political science at Stanford University

763
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,032
One of towns voting on someone's citizenship

764
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,360
Was it that time a huge issue in Switzerland

765
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
Still is

766
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:38,272
No because like back in the early 2000s there were more and more and more people immigrating from countries like

767
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
Kosovo turkey former Yugoslavia

768
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
And when that happened people started noticing something at the Times the media reports about some seemingly disc

769
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Mandatory rejections

770
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
It look like

771
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
Some towns were

772
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Purposely rejecting immigrants from those countries

773
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,216
And in fact in 2003 there was actually a court case

774
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:02,336
In Swiss federal court because there was a town in central Switzerland and

775
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,736
8 Italian applicants got in while 38 applicants from former Yugoslavia where reject

776
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,576
And the court looked at that case and what they basically said is that

777
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,160
I'm a Swiss law immigrants should have a right to appeal

778
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
If that rejected

779
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
No

780
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:23,328
In order for you to make an appeal you need to know right like why you were rejected

781
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
So the decision making body

782
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
Like needs to provide some justification

783
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Why you being rejected

784
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
Basically they said the problem with these town.

785
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:36,896
Is that people can vote Yes or No for any reason they want there's no way to tell why that person was rejected

786
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
And because it seems like

787
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,552
People who were getting rejected were mostly from muslim-majority countries

788
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:49,952
Certain immigrants might be rejected just based on their membership in a certain ethnic cultural group which Friday

789
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,768
The anti-discrimination clause in the Swiss Constitution

790
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
The courts way of solving this is to say that the towns have to justify

791
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Their rejection

792
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,496
And if they person gets rejected that person has to be able to appeal the decision

793
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,824
It's all in the wake of that ruling much more common

794
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
To have politicians

795
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Decide on those

796
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
Naturalization application

797
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
And the Naturalization rates actually went up quite dramatically

798
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
A lot more people started getting citizenship

799
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
Increase particularly

800
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
For those applicants the busy face the strongest discrimination under the direct Democratic vote

801
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,560
Now is that the question of towns voting on citizenship

802
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,400
Has gotten all tangled up in the issue of immigration

803
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728
And there's actually this political party the

804
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,264
Farmers party

805
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
Bowring Park.

806
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
SVP it's a very

807
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Old

808
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
Very rule party

809
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,480
Arguing basically that town should go back

810
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Voting on citizenship

811
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
Yes

812
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,624
This by the way is Lilia my name is Lydia Home Security

813
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:56,256
When we spoke she was an elected representative in the region and head of the immigration support group

814
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
Integration Auto and she basically told me that the SVP which is actually grown pretty dramatically the

815
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
The past couple decades

816
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
The big thing is immigration voting rights Party Station to change

817
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Just stay

818
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Dade

819
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Diamond a sphere area

820
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
I mean when you see this campaigne zits

821
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:23,648
So clear and so easy to understand what they mean just an example of a while back

822
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
The party was campaigning for the slaw they wanted to pass where you could deport an immigrant who commits to crimes and

823
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
10 years

824
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
They put out these poster than on the poster

825
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
R3 white sheep

826
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Kicking a black sheep off

827
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
This was flat but literally taking it off

828
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664
And the party says that it's just meant to represent the black sheep of the family you know what the trouble maker but

829
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
I think it's it's it's

830
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,600
This black sheep it's a black sheep and it's not the black sheep of the family it's the black sheep because it's black

831
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Color and I think it's

832
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Iteration

833
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
Campaign

834
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
We got like that

835
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
Hardy from the right

836
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328
Side of the political Spectrum

837
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,376
I get kind of strong are your berries

838
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:09,216
Andy from over Frank again in every move against

839
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Direct democracy

840
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
Is perceived as

841
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
A lot

842
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Control

843
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
Skip over Frank is actually one of the last towns in Switzerland still holding on to this town vote

844
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,040
Feeling good like that fear of being invaded

845
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Everywhere

846
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
I think it's a fear of loss of culture

847
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
Knowing all that

848
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,264
I wasn't sure how to see Nancy story like

849
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
Is Nancy's attempt to get citizenship and then

850
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Town shooting her down

851
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Is that

852
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
Part of that larger story

853
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,760
I just wasn't sure how to think about Nancy in that contact

854
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Until

855
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,624
I met this one last person in gift over fret

856
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
I was talking to some people

857
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
About

858
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
Nancy and they said oh you want to hear about Nancy

859
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Farmer down the hill

860
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,400
So I went down there you drive down this hill steep steep hill

861
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
To get to his farm

862
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:17,568
There's a really old house and right next to it a barn with cowbells hanging from it

863
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
And I came across him

864
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
His wife

865
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480

Appraisal

00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,127
Already at the point Lake about 200 years ago when this became

885
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
I can fix retinal Astro anymore

886
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Already done people didn't know how old the host

887
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
And right next to the house

888
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
Could we go to the horses

889
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Is a barn

890
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
We're looking at two horses one of them is blond

891
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
Both of them are blind

892
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Paula

893
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
Where he keeps his horses

894
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
JK

895
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
What's new at the horses of his nephew in his nephew he is there is a butcher on the right side

896
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
2000 Bachelor

897
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,079
Interesante

898
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
Youngest with the remark that

899
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,783
Bachelors never get children

900
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
But never go extinct

901
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,903
Yeah

902
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,999
So anyway these horses are where Nancy comes in

903
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
Thank you

904
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,143
Because Nancy rides her bicycle down the little road by

905
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,543
House of barefoot by the way she would Cycles by and I peek into the stable and checking the horses

906
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Industry

907
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,175
The way he's at imitating her is like in the way that you know it's visible for them

908
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,063
50 that she's peeking in from the street Nancy complained about

909
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
The table here

910
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
About that there wasn't enough

911
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Flight

912
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Slimer

913
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,279
She came in me like a fast like a little loud bird I'm done

914
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,815
Press charges against him

915
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
I got my. Came by

916
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Found everything is okay

917
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
But

918
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,543
Nancy didn't give up she kept on completing this was years ago now and apparently

919
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,943
Still comes by here twice a week to get off her bike and make a little show of checking on his horses

920
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
On that he's just

921
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Shaking his ass

922
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695
And on some level it's this is not all that surprising like this what people say over and over again she's so annoying to just drive you crazy

923
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
But on the other hand I feel like

924
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
This is what I kind of

925
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
Realize the emotional impact of what Nancy was

926
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
Doing here like

927
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,751
I mean for one thing this guy has been working with horses on this land

928
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,823
Junkyard for decades and not only that

929
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
His is a

930
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:37,759
Yvette's is there something wrong with you

931
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
January 5th

932
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
And it was

933
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:45,695
Clear to me that Nancy was really poking at something that was painful for him

934
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
It doesn't with a bit of a heavy heart

935
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
That

936
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,327
This type of farming that's not sustainable

937
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,887
Hilton Hotel children like

938
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,727
Ticket in school get a proper job and do something else and there was

939
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Used to have filled

940
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,407
Cherry trees and they would grow wheat book for them to eat and to sell to people who used to have Cows as well

941
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Smallville

942
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:10,015
The cows with all grades on the hills around the farm

943
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:16,415
When you in the evening start looking for them and getting them back into the stable find them by following the ringing of their Bell

944
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
And in the morning everyday of his life is walking up to the sound of the church

945
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,399
Church bells

946
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Pastiche

947
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
Hearing those church bells in the distance

948
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
If they cannot get the feeling of home

949
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
That I'm that sounds really does to you

950
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
And now times are changing

951
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,807
People employed by tech companies in the city

952
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
And I'm moving out to this country to live there and just commute in

953
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,487
And everything's getting really really expensive

954
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Can't afford to fire many more

955
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
They leased out their land

956
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
This way of life

957
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
It over

958
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Yeah

959
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
And so

960
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:07,871
There's this massive sense of palpable culture lost people are coming in it is changing

961
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
The way he has lived

962
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
His entire life

963
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
And that is sad

964
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,295
Just cleared it Nancy coming around

965
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
Check on his horses it was like

966
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
I was just one last

967
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
Insults Tumblr see only problem

968
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,535
Couldn't keep quiet act like a you know like an angry wasp

969
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:31,679
Seahawks realistic Provence Target Aveeno like all the other things that hurt

970
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
And so he didn't want it to become a Swiss citizen if you would have

971
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,359
Definitely voted against her but it felt like too angry to even go to this empty

972
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
IPhone

973
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,015
He was just like Beauty disgruntled with the entire

974
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Town

975
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,159
So get over Frac is one of the last ounce

976
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
To do these Town boats

977
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
But they don't have the final say anymore

978
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,303
Because of those court rulings I mentioned earlier

979
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
Everyone has the right to

980
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
Appeal to government officials in the region

981
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Which

982
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
After being rejected by her neighbors

983
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,263
Twice is exactly what Nancy did

984
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
And she won from door

985
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
Against the town's will

986
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
She was naturalized

987
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Buy everything from the Kenton

988
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
What did it feel like

989
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
To get your citizenship

990
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
I like to

991
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
Corsola

992
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
Zach Wilson

993
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
Big feeling of relief

994
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,071
And I didn't really realize how much of that

995
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
Actually meant to her as well

996
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
And that sometimes you just really really

997
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
Have to stick to your guns

998
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
I did this

999
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,823
Experience change the way you think about democracy

1000
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
It's been a busy

1001
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Shannon Torres

1002
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
The whole procedure

1003
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,319
Slightly disappointed in democracy

1004
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,647
But also taught her a lesson that she says

1005
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
So today she would say

1006
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,743
Democracy is a

1007
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
Power

1008
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,095
And this power should be given to people

1009
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,143
Who deals responsibly with it

1010
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Is it used to

1011
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,775
Power on an emotional level

1012
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
Insulting monkeys in math

1013
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Invita unseen

1014
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Is power should be taken away

1015
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
And honestly

1016
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479
Sitting there with Rudy

1017
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Jessie

1018
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,039
The system of karate

1019
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,111
He said well this is not what democracy

1020
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
I felt conflicted

1021
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Because

1022
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
I

1023
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,607
Understand why he wouldn't want Nancy to be a part of his town and I also kind of I get why it would be painful to give

1024
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
That kind of a choice

1025
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
But then the conversation took

1026
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,287
A turn now used to meet Islam

1027
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
We're having philia and keep you

1028
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Islam

1029
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,735
A lot of people laughing that realized Singapore Pacifica

1030
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,319
Austin from the Constable Bosnia Serbia WW2

1031
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,111
Computer Guy turkey

1032
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
When one person

1033
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
If naturalized

1034
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
They would bring

1035
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,071
Apart from their home country

1036
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
And

1037
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,935
When the partner then comes and stays here 5 or 10 years

1038
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
And we will get that fit like they will get a switch

1039
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
Or two that's how I thought you ain't like this development

1040
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
Celebration game.

1041
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Asthma little bit of a headache

1042
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Why headache

1043
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Mentally dead

1044
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
Steinhoff

1045
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
Intelligent

1046
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
In that moment

1047
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
I realize that

1048
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,607
Behind Nancy story behind the

1049
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:45,215
Just kind of clickbait tale of the woman too annoying to get citizenship

1050
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,823
There are all kinds of things that are a lot harder to talk about

1051
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,359
Harder to separate out

1052
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
A real loss

1053
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
There's fear of

1054
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
A changing world and the promise of

1055
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Received

1056
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
The promise that people could have a voice in a power

1057
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
But

1058
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Also

1059
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Xenophobia

1060
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Hostility

1061
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
And

1062
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
All that made me think about the conversation I had with lots of

1063
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
About his family

1064
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,191
Moving to Canada and

1065
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:22,079
Do you know him watching hockey but all the things that his family tried to do to make a home in their new country

1066
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
I'm wondering if you think that

1067
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,247
If your family had faced more outright hostility do you think they would have

1068
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
You know body in on the club as much

1069
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
Yeah like I think we certainly like like I think there were certainly dark times for my parents were people call them Packy's all the time

1070
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,631
Yeah I'm sure they didn't they didn't anyway

1071
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:51,519
Yeah they did like I think it was in part because it was like okay this is the only place that took

1072
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
Gas like we got a really

1073
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,359
Make good here it's not like we have any other options

1074
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
But I do think like I do think

1075
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,247
Like I think my parents felt a lot of probably felt a lot of pressure

1076
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
2

1077
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,343
Conform in some way like like being the first

1078
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
You know immigrant generation who

1079
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,975
Maybe you still have a trace of an accident Maybe

1080
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,559
Because of the food you eat you still smell a little different

1081
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,959
I'm sure that generation usually that first generation is like super sensitive about those things in like basically comes out at like

1082
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Oh I'm going to be

1083
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,823
The most Canadian like more Canadian than any

1084
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Yeah

1085
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,175
Degree of like erasing you know you're like okay like it like

1086
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,015
Forget that I came from another place like let's just erase all of that

1087
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,623
Yeah and I think about that and how assimilation to me is always seem like a

1088
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Sad word like

1089
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
The giving up of something

1090
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
Somewhere you know

1091
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Yeah

1092
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,839
But at the same time as that sits in my mind

1093
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
I think about

1094
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
Okay what if

1095
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
Lots of lettuce immigrate to Canada

1096
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,775
Yeah and they all think like wow thank you so much

1097
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
Hockey is not for us

1098
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
And now suddenly hockey is no longer the thing that holds social capital and in some way Canadian identity lose

1099
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,855
Does that thing I know it. Now I feel sad or some Indian sport or something yeah

1100
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Where to put that

1101
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,183
Yeah we can I get that I get that

1102
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:19,583
Feeling like where you're like all like just the thing that I love and all the sudden now there are people here who don't love the things

1103
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
And I love and

1104
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,191
My love is being diluted or like my

1105
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,519
Or like or or or even potentially

1106
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Supplanted

1107
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,359
And that like I think that's a fair thing to feel

1108
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
There's also a way to like

1109
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:39,295
To sell it you know like it's like okay like let's get some Indian kids in the NHL I remember

1110
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,599
Are there was a guy Minnie Mouse

1111
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:50,047
I was like obsessive Manny Malhotra he was like an Indian Canadian guy who is

1112
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:54,655
He's like a hockey player and I was like oh yeah cool like if he is in there like I can start to

1113
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,471
Feel my way into it and I think it's just a matter of like

1114
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:04,127
Stella at like share with me why you think this is so great and and let me have some purchase in it you know and then I'll

1115
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Call Suddenlink

1116
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Like I'm going to love that

1117
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Leica III will

1118
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,559
Yeah so we did a lot of work on trying to figure out about what happens to people if they get citizen

1119
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
In some way lettuce

1120
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,423
Speak to something that yantai Mueller told me

1121
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
Really kind of flipped the way that I

1122
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Was thinking about citizen

1123
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
Forecastle

1124
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
You know. Swiss citizenship

1125
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,175
Compared to those who didn't get much more likely to know important facts

1126
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Switzerland

1127
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
They're much more likely to read

1128
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:47,391
Swiss that supposed to Home Country newspaper it's showing that the orientation as we move towards kind of Switzerland and being informed about what's going

1129
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,951
Going on the even report let's termination

1130
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,255
Suggested

1131
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
The citizenship

1132
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
It's not

1133
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,119
As some people argue with the endpoint of

1134
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Integration

1135
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,983
It's not like the crowning achievement of integration process and people work very hard

1136
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
To become citizens and then

1137
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
Haven't there

1138
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,639
It's more that the citizenship itself can be an important catalyst

1139
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
That kind of

1140
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,735
Facilitates the social political and economic integration

1141
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Okay

1142
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:23,743
So I visited Nancy on the day she was going to vote for the first time as a Swiss citizen

1143
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:33,215
I'm nervous you was feeling like my heart's going to visit

1144
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:37,311
I wish I had this on tape but I was not allowed to record in the meeting

1145
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,615
I just parked the car

1146
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
And just I parked the car and was getting out

1147
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,967
At the meeting Nancy rode up on her bike

1148
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,551
And she been talking all day about how she didn't wear shoes

1149
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
And

1150
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,415
I saw that she was wearing shoes and they were a sparkly

1151
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Sequined silver shoes

1152
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
Why are you wearing shoes here and she said

1153
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,935
It's my first meeting as a citizen I just really want to make a good impression and it was just so interesting that the

1154
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
The Moors was rejected

1155
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,263
The more she was like no shoes

1156
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,335
No cowbells at I am Nancy in the second she is

1157
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Accepted

1158
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Do you wear shoes

1159
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
She starts to compromise

1160
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
There is a

1161
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,079
Like I said that maybe one of the quintessential Canadian Foods really a cup

1162
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:46,431
Backlot food but a Canadian food is out 14 right

1163
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,711
It's like a chain

1164
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
I think I like Greg

1165
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Patina

1166
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,319
Hot in Toronto Canadian

1167
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,207
I know it's a Greg's poutine on the menu if I'm remembering last time I went

1168
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,279
It has like a chicken tikka masala

1169
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:07,423
Poutine or something like you're like oh awesome like that's cool like yeah like let's do it both ways

1170
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
Is butts like match this up and now we're

1171
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
Now we're all living in the same place

1172
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,615
You know my heart is getting physically warm

1173
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
