In a park

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
So let me set the scene couple days ago we gathered a bun

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,472
Watch Radiolab listeners McCarren Park in Brooklyn

13

00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Random Sylvan Esso. Whoever showed up as a result of a few tweets and Facebook postings got about 70 people

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,784
A little bit more is it super cold days

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,392
Park is covered in snow and we had brought anybody there to help us makes noises

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
Using the segment

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Like

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Gasping or

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:09,888
Cantiague park annual it was amazing you'll hear them throughout the hour

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,752
But when we got there we had an ex explain to them why we wanted them to make these noises

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
So

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Start things off

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Ask them

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Couple Quest

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,664
Okay so

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Questions of the moment

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,552
Resume music how do you guys like football

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
How do you get tape

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Football

33
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
This is not a shocking Revelation o kind of expected

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Next 10 years but these anti-football sentiments I believe they say more about you and I and our fan

35
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Then the game

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,504
In fairness I mean there are a lot of people who consider myself a

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I watched for the ads for the ads like you were with love

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Game like I have

39
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Lowes it

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Like some others

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Football right now

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Used it is monashee pastime ratings through the 97 and 1/2 million Sunday's game

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Who was the most-watched event in American television history

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
It's massive massively popular that's not the same as

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Also

46
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Usually think about it

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Sally Jenkins author of the book of the real all Americans

48
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
She put it this way imagine a thousand years from now

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Maybe ten thousand maybe a hundred thousand years from now we're all gone

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,472
All our histories been forgotten all the silly trifling games we played and lost

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Imagine the future human being

52
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Looking back on

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Let's say you know

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Some archaeologists goes around digging

55
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
They're going to find these really really

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Huge Stadium

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
That's what they're going to find

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
Okay and they're going to understand just like we understand about the Greeks

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
What was really important to us

60
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
Okay so here's the thing Radiolab listen to do an entire hour on the game of football

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
Depart because just seems to me that there are a lot of questions in the air about football right now

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,968
But what it really is what that means about us what it might or could or can't become

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Am I going to like this

64
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,576
Absolutely this in any way this whole hours for the people like you

65
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
I really don't care about football and I am willing to wager that the end they will care more particular because of this

66
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
Which comes from Sally Jenkins

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Just heard

68
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Consumer book the real all Americans

69
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
This is a story at 9 about the game

70
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
As you might

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Think of it now but

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
About

73
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Where it came from

74
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
Then come to the people you'd expect okay I'm folding my hands

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Secret my love

76
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Three-point stance

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
We're ready to begin

78
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
About the beginning

79
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Well or not quite

80
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,607
I mean football football is as old as some of the Celtic civilization when you can trace

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
Primal games of you know Danish Invaders

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,823
Kicking skulls around the shores of England I mean

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Put up organized football is really a creation of of the 1860s and 70s in this country it supposed Civil War

84
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
For creation comes along

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
Just really a couple of years after the last

86
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Great conquering

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Armies

88
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Settle the West

89
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
Basically says he had these kids who

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Parents have fought the Civil War and then some of them is gone west

91
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
To fight the

92
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,959
Kota the Cheyenne Arapaho the Apaches and now those were winding down

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
Which oddly enough created kind of an issue

94
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
For young minutes

95
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
If you're young

96
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,175
Students ABAC east of fancy school like Harvard how are you been approved

97
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Your own

98
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
When your older brother

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
Your father he may be fought at Gettysburg Battle Little Bighorn

100
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
What the hell have you done the American frontier experience was over there was this feeling among a lot of intellectuals

101
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Spectre

102
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
.com

103
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,351
American men were losing their masculinity they were being

104
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Feminized innocence Sao

105
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
Gordon historian David Adams

106
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
Those kids were desperate for opportunities

107
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
A man up there was a cult of Manliness around this time says they would

108
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
Damn see a bunch of violent Sports takeoff and in particular

109
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Preferences

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
You see these kids at Harvard Yale

111
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,927
Get together and

112
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Knocking the snot out of each other in this game that's kind of like rugby but just

113
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,423
More Violet the game used to be

114
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Basically

115
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Brutality

116
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,871
The origin football was such a profoundly different game writer Chuck Klosterman for him

117
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Historian. Conrad at 3 to get five yards

118
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Basically all the teams did

119
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
Was Liam into each other and try to move the ball incrementally it was almost as if every play

120
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Play the entire game

121
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Is a goal-line stand

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
And wait a minute for clothes used when discussing football scores

123
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Is military it's the idea of taking land and giving

124
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
Will the origin of football that was even app

125
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
There were formations and strategies in the kind of thing but it was

126
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Cure

127
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Like right out of Napoleon's military Playbook and where you you concentrate your forces are showed my shoulder next to

128
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
Your shoulder neck to his shoulder as I get somewhere I

129
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
And she's in the piles of guys

130
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Yeah and inside those files

131
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,119
There's all kinds of things go on and no scrubs I mean is kicking is biting his couch and I couching in crotch kicking and

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,215
Wowhead wrenching and Hardy Boys doing

133
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,799
I have to work to imagine that because I think of Harvard and Yale now and I think

134
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
Take off like a Pencil Neck Geek

135
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039
Well at the time they were the I mean they're all these wonderful stories about these shops that they would eat for dinner I mean they

136
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
They were drinking milk by the gallon and

137
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,463
Power of the time physically as well as intellectually

138
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Then Along Comes This

139
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
School

140
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
In 1879 in the middle of nowhere

141
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
That

142
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
If you're a football fan

143
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
The fan of American history

144
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Kind of changed everything

145
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Where was Carlo Carlo was in Pennsylvania

146
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
Very close to Gettysburg so so so tell me about what what is

147
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
This wind is it formed and what was it

148
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
The Carlisle Indian School is formed by a former of but actually he was an active military officer at the time named Richard head

149
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Andre Pratt

150
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
The guide

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Shock of white hair

152
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
Large-nosed gallantly quite gallantly in the Civil War

153
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,119
And then he did actually served out west in Oklahoma territory

154
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
He had fought

155
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,751
American Indians himself it was after winning a lot of those fights

156
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
Too many of those fights really

157
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
No talking a 1870s now that Pratt

158
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
How to change your heart and he

159
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
He suddenly became concerned

160
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
About the very people you just been fighting the fact of the matter is that Indians weren't very very desperate situation

161
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,743
Are the Bison were almost extinct that they were being pushed onto reservations

162
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
And population

163
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Fallen 2

164
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
It's almost all time low

165
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
And a lot of other

166
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,079
Policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to happen fast or Indians would literally become

167
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
Extinct they would in fact become

168
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
The Vanishing race

169
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Ethel Pratt

170
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
He comes to Washington with an idea

171
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
His idea was started boarding schools

172
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Specifically for American Indian children

173
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,303
It was kind of radical experiment children will be taken removed for several years at a time

174
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,935
They would be stripped of their I was call their Savage Heritage and they would be civilized

175
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,287
IE they would be white italicized it was it was forcible assimilation

176
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Pratt head of a slogan

177
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Kill the Indian

178
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Save the man

179
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
That's Barbara Landis Carlisle Indian School biography

180
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Wait what up the Carlyle to talk with her and her colleague Kara Curtis

181
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
And they told us it Pratt basically made that pitch

182
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Save the man

183
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
Not just to Congress but directly to American Indian families

184
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
All over the country I want your son

185
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Is that how does that work I want your children because white people are going to keep coming and coming they want to settle

186
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
Telling your lands they want to take your land

187
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
And you need to learn how to

188
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Deal with these people

189
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
So we need to teach your children how to speak English how to communicate with the white vans

190
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
When the white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the Black Hills

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
You won't fall for it again and it was a convincing argument

192
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Well you know back in those days

193
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
You're talking about survival over here

194
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Do I need to do to yourself

195
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Hey my name is Joe American Horse

196
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
I'm sending 9 years old

197
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Anime grandson of Chief American Horse

198
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
Joe lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota East Lakota

199
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
He told us the story about his grandfather

200
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
I was a famous Lakota chief

201
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
In the 1890s is Grandpa's

202
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
Led a delegation of American Indians to Washington

203
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Well he went to Washington DC

204
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
And if he was down there but he's a lot of people down there just as

205
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
Is Grandpa at this moment where he was just stunned by how many white people there were

206
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
His face was

207
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
They're like ants

208
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
And pretty soon they're going to come to the area so

209
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
He had the idea of a

210
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Trying to send his kids to school so they can

211
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,591
Intermingle or intercepted whatever basically just has his grandpa just had this realization

212
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Recant

213
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Weekend

214
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Go back

215
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
I got to go forward

216
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
And it seemed to him Carlisle

217
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Was the way forward

218
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,391
Where we going now

219
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Baskets were admitted here's how it would work they would

220
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Come in

221
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
And it immediately have their picture taken

222
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
On arrival

223
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Then they be given an Extreme Makeover

224
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Which would also be photographed

225
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
This is Tom torlino

226
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
Barbershop is a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old is 1882 this is when he arrives

227
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
So you he's got kinda dark skin high cheekbones earring

228
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,279
Britt necklace looks like it might be made of bone and he's wrapped in a blanket

229
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
And here he is in a suit with clean cut hair the second picture his hair is very short not long

230
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
No blankets wearing a three-piece suit sitting there with spread collar and parted hair

231
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Snapchat you have

232
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Indian

233
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Tom Wightman

234
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Alex and Sophie

235
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
Joe American Horse said his family's all that transformation firsthand and Sophie was there in Carlisle for 5 years

236
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,023
When she came back and she looks like a white woman didn't know she had that real tiny waist and

237
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Bloomington everything

238
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
And

239
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
She can't speak Lakota

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
She forgot

241
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Haha

242
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
We just think about this for a second just think

243
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
We spoke with one guy oppressor Eric Anderson who teaches at Haskell is us apart Potawatomi just

244
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Imagine the parents

245
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
The first time they see their kids

246
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,575
Parents are seeing their students marched around in

247
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Essentially the uniform of

248
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
What had not

249
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Very long before for many of the tribes been

250
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
The uniform of the enemy

251
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
At the very least

252
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
I think that would be

253
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Startling

254
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
According to Sally Jenkins after the kids were recruit

255
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
And we dressed

256
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,711
Brentwood running through a bunch of drills in Carlisle was a little Military Academy

257
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
The Indian kids were so unhealthy at first they have been put on an unfamiliar diet they had been sleeping indoors

258
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,487
For the first time in their lives and a lot of them were getting sick we know that in the 39-year history of the school

259
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
At least

260
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
200 kids

261
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Died

262
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Of disease

263
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Poor health or even home sick

264
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
And she was constantly trying to get the kids outside

265
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
And

266
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
At a certain point he hired some teachers

267
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Sally thinks that one of those tires

268
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
Probably one of the first dormitory Masters

269
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
This guy who had formerly taught at Ivy League

270
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
School he showed the Carlisle Indian kids

271
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
This game with the kids at Harbor playing

272
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Maybe he thought it would toughen him up

273
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
Knows but suddenly

274
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
They're playing football

275
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
No keep in mind this is

276
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
You know at a point like an 1882 where

277
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Football's barely a thing

278
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Not so many schools had teams it wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then they were volunteer coaches who tended to Beast

279
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Students are asked students for the Carlyle kids self-organized level the field start to play they even start a scrimmage some kids across

280
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
West Town and at one of those games

281
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Call you Barbara

282
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,343
Staci Matlock who is upon a student at Carlisle later became a Pawnee chief

283
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
He broke his leg

284
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Playing football in Pratt that's it

285
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Football

286
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
Is in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids in football was doing the opposite

287
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
But

288
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Showtime later

289
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,567
Set David Adams approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came into Pratt's office they said we want to play football

290
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
Do we know what they said exactly we don't have we don't have the exact words

291
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
My Pratt says at one point

292
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
He says while they stood around my desk

293
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
I'm calling your mother stood around my desk there black eyes intently watching

294
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,279
This is the order gave practically all the arguments in favor

295
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
About contending an outside football

296
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
And ended up

297
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Requesting the removal of the Embargo

298
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
According to his Memoir Pratt was

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,103
Sore bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the peel

300
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Suicide

301
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Okay you can play

302
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
If you do these two things Juanita's

303
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
Never slug

304
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Okay

305
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,975
And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America

306
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
And

307
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,607
At that early Point American football team was yell

308
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Which brings us to October 24th 1896

309
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,127
Power off all day in New York who played New York yes at the old Polo Grounds

310
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Apparently there was about 4,000 people in the stands including a handful of newspaper men New York newspaper men

311
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
Give me a big story how did they publicize it what did they say

312
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
University

313
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,471
Typically the Perfection of modern Athletics and intellectually the culture and refinement of the best modern American Life

314
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,871
On the other side

315
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:22,271
The real song of the forest and playing the Redskins history of story of War

316
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
Maybe by education

317
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Written in this blood-curdling was shot through with Indian cliches you know from the Redskins

318
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Redskins

319
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Indian fashion

320
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker in the early 1880s your contact with an American Indian

321
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Was in a wild west show

322
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
It was theater

323
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
And here comes a football game

324
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:59,135
And all of these American Indian kids run onto the field and there's literally an instance

325
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
In one of the first games

326
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
Someone in the audience says will they look just like our boys

327
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Because of course

328
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
That's a pratt wanted

329
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Now one thing it was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlyle players was that they were physically outmatched

330
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,919
The impression going in as it'll be an absolute smear job

331
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
But they released the odds are heavily against

332
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
But

333
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
3 minutes into the game in the midst of a big pile up

334
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
Fumbles the ball becomes squirting out

335
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Carla guy picks it up

336
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
And runs

337
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
The entire length of the field 63 yards

338
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,871
Scores a touchdown

339
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Now

340
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,039
Nobody had scored on Yale and seven games they were Furious so what they do is they use their bulk

341
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Two slowed

342
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
Push the pile down the field

343
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Twice

344
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,047
To take leave and the three minutes left

345
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,143
Get what's up 12 to 6 Carlisle has the ball

346
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
Carlisle running back charges the pile in gets clobbered falls backwards

347
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
Just as he's about to hit the earth he laterals the ball to a teammate

348
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,487
Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game but

349
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
It's called back

350
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Bye

351
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
A referee

352
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Who was the Yale man

353
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,751
Why the call was that the referee claimed that a whistle had blown

354
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
The play dead

355
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
It was a crowd reaction

356
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Well they were they were Furious

357
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Yes there was bullying on

358
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
And putting everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of justice and some of the Carlyle players head

359
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
We are leaving this game

360
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
But according to David

361
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
At the last moment Pratt runs down from the stand coming onto the fields of ways I don't forget rule number one

362
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Be a gentleman

363
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Pratt did not want

364
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
This game to end

365
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
Because of their tempers even though they've been wrong

366
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Bye

367
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
By that call

368
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
So the Cowboys

369
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Finished

370
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
And when they walk off the field

371
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
They get a standing ovation

372
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
Carlisle wins incredible respect in renown

373
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
In the aftermath of the game in fact one of the newspaper men

374
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
After another Carlisle Yale game or something

375
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Similar happy

376
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
Wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11-year men but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a yield

377
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Referee yes

378
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
After the Yale game of 1896 Pratt

379
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Is committed

380
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,599
Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school

381
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,951
It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15

382
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
Years at the Carlisle school which is to prove the value

383
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
Are these American Indian kids against their white peers

384
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
Through the valley where the quote civilized

385
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Civilize them

386
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:30,079
But also to prove that given education and equal opportunity they were the equal of there

387
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
That's another white Pierce

388
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
I mean he was

389
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,783
For all of his forcible assimilation methods which were to remain extremely cruel

390
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
And destructive

391
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Keep

392
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
I truly believed

393
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
In the concept of of racial equality

394
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
The complicatedness

395
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Pratt

396
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Ahold Carlisle idea

397
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Kep smacking ass in the face as we were putting the show together I mean on the one hand they were clearly students who felt that Carlisle was prison

398
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Is that Barbara Landis

399
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,079
When she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former

400
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Carlisle Indians

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Squishies

402
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
Kids weaving Set Fire to the buildings

403
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
It's that yes M did burn down which is kind of typical on Indian campuses

404
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
Fires in burning building why

405
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Is a form of resistance

406
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
On the other hand

407
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,352
When will you start looking around for original archival recordings of

408
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
See the earliest Carlisle players pretty much the only recording me to find

409
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
Much of your making is possible

410
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,128
With this oral history with a guy named

411
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Andrew

412
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Albert exendine

413
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
1899

414
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
You are 15 years old

415
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,304
Can't really play you too much of this cuz the audio quality is really bad but in the interview

416
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Brad comes up

417
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Be alright

418
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,496
And xidan talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude

419
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Time is it father of King in education

420
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Call the father of Indian education

421
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Man so he's a tough figure Pratt he's got a very mixed Legacy I mean I like to say Pratt was his country

422
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
Whatever you think of him he was his country

423
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
It's okay so 1896 he gets

424
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
The body

425
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
FootballScoop ER yes

426
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
What happens next

427
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
He begins looking around for coaches full-time coach

428
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Just to come in and coach

429
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
The team

430
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
And he whines up

431
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
With a Cornell grad

432
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
Name Pop Warner

433
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,296
Glenn Pop Warner

434
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
Is this part right here

435
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
Just to give you a visual

436
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Harbin Kerasotes pictures looks kind of like Mike Ditka

437
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
If Mike Ditka head Einstein's hair

438
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Pops a little bit of a of an outlier

439
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
History status Texas routes

440
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,056
He's a bit of a rogue can be kind of vulgar

441
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
Party a little bit really

442
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion

443
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
When he gets the Carlisle

444
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Because popwarner looks at his Squad and he realizes that

445
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
Sure they're fast they got heart but they're underweight and they're small

446
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,048
Waste all your well they might occasionally force a tie with it with a Yale if they you know

447
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Have killed themselves

448
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Physically

449
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
They weren't going to beat the ivy League's on any kind of consistent basis without

450
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Without doing something different

451
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
And dumb

452
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
There's a very fine line between innovation

453
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
And cheating

454
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,480
And Pop Warner starts at exploiting that line absolutely

455
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
As hard as he can

456
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
And he comes up with

457
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
The trick play

458
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
For example 1903

459
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
Pop Warner devices the hidden ball trick

460
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
But what is that

461
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,584
Hidden ball trick is the quarterback takes the ball

462
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
And actually behind the shooter pile of men

463
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Tucks it under another guy's sweater

464
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
While the big pile of man is struggling in the mud in the center of the field not knowing quite where the football is but believing it's some

465
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
Summer in the middle of the pile with the football

466
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,696
Before anybody realizes it how did you keep the ball from falling out of his jersey I think they actually

467
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:36,096
Show The Jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out a cheating pocket native cheating

468
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,216
Pocket without legal because they got together legitimate touchdown was it legal you ask

469
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Pop Warner would have said

470
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,824
There was nothing in the rulebook against it

471
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,152
Does which actually work brilliantly

472
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Is a

473
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
He sews footballs

474
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
On to the front of their

475
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Jersey's which were really bulky sweaters at the time he sews leather football-shaped patches onto the front of

476
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
Their jerseys in order to try to disguise who's got the ball

477
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Ivory Coast goes insane

478
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Black

479
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
Harvard did not take this lying. Harvard retaliates by painting the footballs the same color

480
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
As their jerseys it's maroon everywhere so when they basically

481
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,976
You can't see it American football is essentially a rule-breaking experience

482
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
As opposed to British football which

483
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Didn't have referees

484
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
At least initially a British football ran on the on Earth

485
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
But with American football

486
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,264
The rest were there practically from the beginning and she says it was largely a response

487
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,592
The brutality the game but also to the kind of rule-bending

488
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
That you saw from Pop Warner in the Carlisle Indians Every Time popcorn and came up with an innovation the next year there was a

489
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Rule against it

490
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,600
So immediately I believe we get together and pass a rule and say okay no more of that

491
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
NFL rulebook really virgins

492
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
In American football and it's thanks to Pop Warner

493
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,304
Sleight of hand and pop Warner's greatest sleight-of-hand

494
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
And maybe

495
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
The Carlisle Indians most

496
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Soaring moment and I mean that literally

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
Happened

498
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
At a moment when the game almost disappeared

499
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
That's coming out

500
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,808
Start of message

501
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Yes this is David Adams who's Conrad trained and I got an email message asking me to read credit Tech

502
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science

503

Technology in the modern world more information about Sloan's at www.slha.org

504
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,384
The lab is produced by WNYC and distributed by NPR

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Okay there it is

506
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
And this message

507
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,088
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

508
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136
And I'm here because I need your help

509
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
This summer

510
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
And I request

511
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

512
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,960
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

513
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,312
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

514
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,664
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that

515
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Maybe it was the moment that I

516
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
Kids started reading back

517
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
To you

518
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

519
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,952
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

520
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,816
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

521
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
We're interested in the

522
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Epic moments where

523
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,752
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

524
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
If you have a story

Thank you so much

531
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
I'm rubber Coolidge is Radiolab and getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian School and the

532
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Birth

533
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Of the

534
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Monogama football

535
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,736
What is the most important moments in the story I happens at a time when football it was right on the edge

536
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Disappearing

537
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Timeout 1905

538
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
This was

539
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
The most violent year in football today

540
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,304
19 people died on the football 19

541
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
19

542
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,728
That's crazy cuz what would happen is that Carla will try and do these things to throw to open up the game

543
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,592
The Ibis would consistently respond by making the game more about Brute Force more about violence

544
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
So you had all these debts and suddenly all the major programs were spooked

545
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
Columbia polls are their football team

546
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
Harvard even think about doing that and so and this is kind of odd Into The Fray steps the president of the United States of America

547
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Teddy Roosevelt

548
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
The conrad beijing

549
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
He'd like football he like the

550
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,656
The manly aspects of it's a tough aspects of it but nobody like people dying

551
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,472
And then there was his his his son

552
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
What's playing

553
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
And and getting beat up pretty badly as well

554
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
Broke his nose

555
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
Plated eyebrow the one game he got knocked out cold

556
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,456
So after the violence about 5

557
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
The president

558
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
Calls the president of all these colleges in Suwanee

559
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
The Washington and according to David Adams he basically tells

560
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,184
That the rules had to be Rewritten it had it become

561
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
A little bit more safe at least or it would be bad

562
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
In out of that we see a couple of roaches

563
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
China's first school to side in order to loosen up the

564
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Pile

565
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
They're going to Tinker with the

566
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Down yardage ratio

567
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
3 Downs of game 5 yards of pea

568
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
3 Downs.

569
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
10 yards

570
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Renounce

571
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
4 weeks

572
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Bubble years later

573
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Is that the second rule change

574
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Just may be the most

575
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Important

576
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
Raise for the first time

577
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
They legalize the ability

578
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
To move the ball

579
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Through

580
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Free floating air

581
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Surrounds us all

582
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
Okay so where do we go to the next today sick if I could if I could

583
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,472
Replace you in a moment unless there's a moment before this you'd like to hit

584
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
I believe

585
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
November 23rd 1907

586
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,920
Yes your big moment okay can you set the scene

587
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,784
From the standpoint of broader American history things have gone airborne

588
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,720
You mean Wilbur and Orville Wright 1960

589
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,632
There are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world in France

590
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:05,216
Everyone is experimenting with flying machines things are going up in the air

591
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
But not so fast with football because

592
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,896
When the rule committee had made that rule about for passing they'd also hedged a little bit saying

593
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
If you throw forward pass through receiver doesn't catch it

594
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,528
You are penalized 15 yards which back in the day

595
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,624
With a monster amount so nobody threw the ball was too risky.

596
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
Story goes as soon as that ruled that passed pop when it goes back to his garage so he's a garage with a ball

597
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,608
Any starts experimenting and what would be the most

598
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Efficient way

599
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Apostasy

600
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,520
Why people have to understand that the footballs and those days are not the footballs we have today with the nice

601
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,640
Oblate spheroid or whatever they call it with a nice points and thinks he's a rugby ball

602
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Citic imagine that deflated basketball

603
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
They're sticker in the middle they're not as well shaped

604
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
They're really tough to get your hand on

605
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Death row right and in 1906 in Albert exendine zorrel history weight

606
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
We talked about this in 1906

607
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:06,144
He says called all the players together he tells them

608
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
You will have to learn

609
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,752
Karla Bonoff

610
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,592
He says I think you can have to learn to spiral the ball

611
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Cuz if you throw the ball in the spiral

612
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,176
10 times less Air drag

613
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
And if you throw it and over and plus it's easier to

614
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
They start

615
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:27,392
Experimenting with it a little bit in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense

616
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
Which gets us to that game

617
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,840
November 23rd 1907 Carlisle plays the University of Chicago last game of the season where in Chicago

618
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,936
Chicago in the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation video

619
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
I don't think you can argue about

620
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
What color is good at this point though

621
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Yeah but Chicago is like

622
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
Stagg field

623
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
And they're 27000 people in the stands

624
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,576
Well what happened was the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative

625
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
Forward passing

626
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
I just

627
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,488
Knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage

628
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
Until Carlisle's greatest receiver

629
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Albert exendine our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minutes ball was snapped Chicago players would

630
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,520
Hit him and try to throw him down or knocking out of bounds

631
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,872
So Pop Warner said the exendine here's what we're going to do

632
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Next time they hit you out of bounds

633
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,736
Sneak around the bench and get back on the field

634
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
By some accounts with X and I

635
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
On the next play

636
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
I would like to dine at expected ends up out of bounds

637
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,280
But he keeps running

638
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
He runs around the back of the bench

639
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
Renter and spectators

640
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
Maybe around the van and comes back on the field

641
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Reddit that moment

642
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle

643
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Lex Luthor vicious spiral

644
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
Can I have urethras something shitbag

645
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,552
This is Sally's description of that moment from her book the real All-American

646
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,392
For a moment it was a frozen scene in a stage drama

647
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,280
The ball hung in the air a tantalizing possibility

648
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Woody catch it

649
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Or drop it

650
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Defenders wheeldon stare-down field

651
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Spectators watching from the stands

652
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
Brett had died in their Collective throats the spiraling ball seemed

653
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
To defy physics

654
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
What made it stay up

655
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
When will it come down

656
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,760
In that long moment 27000 spectators

657
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,832
Mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms

658
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:38,208
May have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion

659
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,536
I've noticed something they never had before

660
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,888
Butterball traveling through space traces of profoundly elegant path

661
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,448
They may have realized something else

662
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
That it was beautiful

663
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
The ball struck is human target

664
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
Action done caught the pass all alone

665
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
And trotted over the Chicago line

666
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
The stadium

667
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,608
Louder than sound in motion it was the game breaker the rest was just anticline

668
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008
The final score was 18244 Carlisle

669
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,064
But very next year the ivy league pass is a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back on

670
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:41,184
That's what I wrote Come Together say that that description of the ball in the air

671
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Is

672
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Timeless

673
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
Anyway that's exactly why football is still beautiful at a time

674
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
That's that's that's when

675
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes the sport that you watched

676
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
Oh wow this is this the field

677
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
This is the fee can we get out

678
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
After we spent an entire day looking at

679
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
Pictures of

680
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
You know Albert exendine in

681
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
Pride Pop Warner and doulas Lone Wolf and

682
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,776
Lino and all these Carlisle players Barbara and Carol took us to the field where they practice

683
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
Answer this is the Carlyle

684
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
Indian School football field

685
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
Covered in snow

686
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:40,064
10 degrees out here really really bright sun coming off this now

687
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Insert empty

688
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
We just kind of walked around and

689
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
Try to imagine all the stuff we just seen in photos

690
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,888
He was a little bit like walking among ghosts

691
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
That's the sound of the flag blowing in the back

692
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,088
Understanding on that feel the end

693
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Having two

694
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
Thought that I couldn't quite articulate

695
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,024
The later of Eric Anderson a professor from Haskell

696
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
Member of the Potawatomi Nation

697
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Surprise finger on it

698
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
Essentially said that like there's a lot of room on a football field

699
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Miss room for

700
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,384
Anger and war and violence is also room for pride

701
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:43,040
And a kind of coming together that's not a pratt coming together where one side gets erased

702
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
But it is a coming together

703
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Yeah I mean there is a middle ground

704
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
Clearly it's more than a game

705
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,000
The stakes are higher than that

706
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
You know

707
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,632
Will we as Indian people be accepted

708
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
On our own terms

709
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Also

710
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
In our ability

711
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
To meet you

712
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Halfway

713
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
Will we be accepted

714
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Through

715
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
This as the vehicle

716
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:20,160
It's clearly more than the game

717
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
A lot of people to think of this episode I we had original music made for us for that episode from Morgan okay

718
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,856
Kane you can hear him right here playing the banjo that's Morgan Oakland music.

719
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136

And whether the Brooklyn called

739
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
To scream and holler and bring the story to life

740
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
Speaking of that

741
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,112
Very special thanks to Brenna Farrell who found the story and produced it with us and production support from Damiano Marquis

742

That's a lot of people

743
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
To have back but we will help you will have more to listen to and what people to think in the second half of our broke

744
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Yeah we're going to take a distinctly modern view on football coming up

745
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
Are we

746
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Okay

747
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808

Delicious

750
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
We like to go

753
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Yes sir

754
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
And the first half we talked about football

755
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Came from

756
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
I want to look at where it's going

757
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
Conversation these days

758
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,896
Everything about that we have talking with one of my favorite

759
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Horse riders

760
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Chuck Klosterman

761
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,272
I'm a writer and a journalist in Brooklyn you may know him from

762
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,832
Ethicist column in the New York Times he also writes

763
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,112
About sports for Grantland

764
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Any recently wrote an essay

765
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
About

766
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Football and it's

767
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Inherent country

768
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Prediction

769
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
We called for us this way

770
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
Carlisle versus IV free flow versus

771
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Traditional

772
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Sort of thing but in a modern way

773
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,056
I want you to explain the statement

774
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
This is the thing I found most

775
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
You say basic

776
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Bed bug bites

777
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
Training itself as a super conservative

778
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,296
Traditional manly sport but essentially

779
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
Operating is the opposite

780
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,904
It's really liberal wide-open anything goes going to

781
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Football became the most

782
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
Successful Enterprise in America

783
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
Do you have The Descent in it

784
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Pretending to be one thing but actually another

785
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
What do you mean

786
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,008
Okay it's it's a unique thing in the sense that you look at a sport like soccer or baseball

787
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
There is a real

788
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
Since from the people who sort of

789
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
The institution of the sport to keep the sport the same

790
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
But they want the sport to sort of almost transcend time would be the same game now is it always

791
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Soccer particularly

792
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,903
They hate any kind of attempt to change the rules in the

793
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,231
Football works in the exact opposite way

794
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Football

795
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
Constantly evolving

796
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,887
Constantly adopting new ideas and new technologies

797
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
And is very willing

798
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,287
To alter the game in order to make it more free-flowing

799
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Oreimo Progressive game

800
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
I mean football will add things like

801
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,735
Coaches can talk to the quarterback threw a radio in their helmet

802
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,783
It has been determined that the receiver

803
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,927
Now the idea of instant replay was added very early on compared to other

804
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
The game itself

805
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,791
From an offensive perspective

806
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
Is constantly being reinvented

807
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,263
Chuck says if you look at all the new formations that keep getting at and all the trick plays that are tried out every year it is

808
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,151
Play clear the football as a game it actually is the most liberal sport in terms of adopting ideas

809
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
But

810
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
V

811
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,783
The morality of the game in the center of

812
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
The thing that really draws people to

813
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Love it

814
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,927
Is sort of almost most reactionary

815
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Air quality

816
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999
That it's still sort of comes down

817
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:17,119
To the strongest toughest win

818
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,447
This is why I feel like football has

819
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
It is

820
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Both song

821
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Built for American

822
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,151
If the American way of thinking and also didn't so popular that it allows you

823
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,247
Sort of think about the game in a very liberal Progressive Way

824
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Carlisle way but

825
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,391
Spiritually it like your heart of it can still be this kind of old

826
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Comfortable conservative mindset

827
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
Does old Ivy fundamentals of Power Inn

828
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Might

829
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,167
Tradition of the beliefs if that's really what most people want most people want to think of themselves

830
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
As Progressive

831
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,823
But feel conservative argument is it is it is footballs unique ability to be both

832
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
The same time reactionary

833
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,735
And simultaneously wildly inventive so that you can think about it one way and feel about another

834
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,575
That is what makes football the most popular part

835
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Ivar sporting call

836
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Right now by

837
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Factory

838
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,511
What he means is it the NFL's three times as popular as the next most pop

839
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
Motorsport

840
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
In the question we got to

841
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Just cuz of the quest

842
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
You can't really avoid right now is

843
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Is it going to stay that way

844
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Which is weird

845
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Era for the

846
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Sport

847
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
Certainly mylifetime the strangest are they

848
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
Weird things are happening one is that

849
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Injuries

850
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Actor in

851
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
There seems to be no limit

852
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,831
To the amount that we can discuss the problems with the game

853
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Concussions in

854
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
In football if your coach how do you handle all this

855
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,463
This discussion about neurologist in head injuries doing

856
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,535
The idea that so many former NFL players

857
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
Are essentially you know decrepit and and

858
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Why do I have problems

859
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,215
Study their brains after they die and they have the brains of people who

860
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
Should have been a hundred 80 years old and had Alzheimer's or whatever you know there was just a kid from Ohio State

861
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Who shot himself

862
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Has he sent a text to his mother saying

863
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
I am sorry if I'm an embarrassment

864
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
I basically text his mom and said it was like

865
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
I think it's contractions and are making me do this these concussions have my head all

866
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Effed up

867
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
At the same time it is an American Pastime

868
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Game with the most watch

869
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Event in American television

870
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,519
I think it's very plausible that the Superbowl this year will be the most

871
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,079
Watched sporting event of all time

872
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
In America

873
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
And this is why you feel a small

874
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Cold wind in the air like

875
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
I feel absolutely

876
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Usually never been serious.

877
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Discussion

878
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
About should we as a culture be playing football since

879
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,303
Since Roosevelt 1905

880
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
No one seems to be

881
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Stopping themselves

882
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
From watching these games

883
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
So it's almost like there are these two silos

884
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
Two separate streams in our Collective unconscious that exist simultaneously and I both like shooting Skyward

885
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,223
Okay so we got to be honest like when Chuck was talking

886
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,551
About the whole idea of Silo shooting Skyrim

887
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
Cool idea but we weren't really sure what that meant

888
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Exactly

889
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
And so much that is until our producers are in Wheeler Mets

890
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
Emily Bartell

891
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
You could add something like

892
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
She want

893
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,567
I'm on a Bartell I'm a Libra enjoy long walks on the beach

894
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
So money is a partner in a media production company she lives with her husband there for kids outside of Atlanta Georgia but actually

895
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
Go to talk to her about her son Parker

896
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Because money says

897
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
The very moment he was born

898
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
So what are you thinking

899
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
When Park

900
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
As soon as the doctor

901
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
Saw his third thumb

902
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:07,007
We're going to the NFL baby yes and then Parker's 10001

903
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Announce

904
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
He's the biggest thing he walked out the womb

905
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,407
I'm still going with 3rd Stop

906
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Parker comes out and he's the biggest thing I've ever seen you know I've prepared for months and I've found

907
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
Perfect outfit to take him home from the hospital and and this Joker's too big for it

908
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,119
So right then I'm like oh my God yes yes

909
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:39,775
He's a boy and he's going to play in the NFL to play in the NFL a lot of families pass down quilts

910
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,871
They pass down family businesses are family tradition

911
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
What's football

912
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
It was football

913
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
My dad played football

914
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
The Lions leading Rodger was Mel fire he was a running back for the Detroit Lions actually Rookie of the Year

915
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Year 1967

916
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
His brother played

917
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Miller Farm Jerome

918
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:05,119
My uncle her brother is Mel Farr Jr and Michael far both play football and Jerry levias who they

919
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
Jerry ball

920
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
I can't even

921
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
If I

922
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,615
I said I was going to actually write them all down

923
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,663
But it's something like 33

924
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,759
Family members have played in the NFL

925
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
Coming from a sports family

926
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,159
We had to play a sport

927
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,047
So I can remember getting up in the mornings before school six 7 in the morning and having agility drills

928
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,911
We lived on the house like just at home in your backyard in the backyard

929
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,495
We lived on a hill and

930
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:47,103
I didn't have it as bad as my brothers because I play tennis I started playing tennis at 3

931
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
But

932
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:55,551
Like in the wintertime my dad would strap my brother to the sled and my dad was sit in the sled they would

933
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,879
I have to run up the hill with my dad in the sled

934
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
Tire drills everything

935
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
Do you have a sense of light

936
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Why

937
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
I think for my dad

938
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,679
Sports opened up so many doors for him my dad's from Beaumont TX

939
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
He was in Texas at a very

940
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,519
You know during segregation

941
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,847
So Sports allowed him to get out

942
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,151
It allowed him to provide

943
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
An excellent

944
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
Lifestyle for

945
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
Prince family

946
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,039
And being drafted to the Detroit Lions

947
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,111
And being a football player in the Motown era

948
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
Weekends at my house consisted of

949
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Marvin Gaye in

950
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
Glen Burnie and Charlie Sanders who are all in the Hall of Fame that my father actually and Lynn Bernie sang background

951
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,567
Marvin Gaye's what's going on

952
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
No my dad has a gold record

953
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
And when he stopped playing football

954
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
He opened up his first

955
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
Car dealership

956
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Another

957
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,999
And another and four times the Mel Farr Auto Group

958
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,887
Was actually the largest African-American owned business in the country I mean that's what football did for him

959
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Football

960
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Gave my dad

961
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
A life

962
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,567
So Parker

963
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Haley Bennett

964
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,943
So you start looking for leagues like we moved to Georgia when Parker was to

965
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
And I found one that started at 4

966
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,831
Just two more years of like a countdown

967
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
Oh my gosh one more year

968
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
And

969
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
When Parker turned four

970
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,535
I mean I can sleep the night before I might cat

971
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Tomorrow's the day

972
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,375
Docker has no idea what's going on

973
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,215
I go up there bright and early first person in line here's my check

974
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
4 years old full on contact football at 4

975
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Wood helmet

976
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Helmet pads

977
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
Spring training

978
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
Parker heads

979
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
Spring training

980
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,015
He's going to the tires

981
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
Keys for

982
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Okay

983
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,879
That we don't even have team colors yet

984
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,951
But I'm there and what I feel like the team color should be

985
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,999
I hope they're in Honolulu blue

986
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,559
Is silver cuz that's Detroit life colors

987
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:20,191
So this is just at the spring training then we get to the actual team practice

988
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
They immediately they named in the tank

989
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
He was just going through people there like

990
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,783
First practice I'm not thinking about the other parents and their little

991
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,575
Normal sized children

992
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,207
And the fact that bite you know after the first day of practice three kids quit because Parker hedges

993
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,535
Wow them over I'm like yes my son is obese

994
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,911
Football in where we live

995
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Is huge

996
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,007
At four years old they were tailgating

997
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
No I'm serious

998
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,455
The coaches have matching outfits that headgear like are you kidding me you guys are talking on microphone

999
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
And I'm like

1000
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Wow this is

1001
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
This is freaking serious

1002
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
And the coaches are cursing like

1003
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
You guys are playing like a bunch of

1004
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
Oh my god wow they're for

1005
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Don't even know what that is

1006
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
Wow it's that

1007
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Serious

1008
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
Are you starting

1009
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
To think

1010
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
This is ridiculous

1011
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,495
At any point or it's just they were

1012
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
Money says she knew that

1013
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:35,199
Game of thorn Parker's team would take the field go fight with the proudest

1014
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Moment as a pet

1015
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
My sign

1016
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
It's a personal foul

1017
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
I know

1018
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
It's terrible

1019
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
I'm my son

1020
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
Just tackles this guy

1021
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Imma coach you know you would always

1022
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Makes me dirty

1023
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,679
So after you tackle them my son took his head and play Future

1024
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
But I had to keep myself down

1025
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
Cut the kid who's eating mom every day start

1026
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,175
Is when I realize I'm like God

1027
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
If my son was just

1028
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,063
Attacked by a 65 lb 4 year old I probably be a bit upset

1029
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
Well this is a progression

1030
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
This is okay they got the matching outfits

1031
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,719
Okay to eat dirt and then you go home and reflect

1032
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Holiday Inn

1033
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
Oh my gosh

1034
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Kids mom

1035
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
But then

1036
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
We get to the Super Bowl

1037
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
So I'm fanatical

1038
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
The superlative for 5 year olds

1039
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
Super Bowl

1040
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
My son has a trophy that's

1041
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,031
It's probably

1042
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
3 ft tall

1043
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,151
The crazy part is that as all this is happening as Parker's taking the field with us

1044
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
4 and 5 year old teammates

1045
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,503
A family member had really really started showing

1046
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,367
Signs of Life

1047
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Chronic traumatic

1048
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Encephalopathy

1049
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Which is the

1050
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
What comes from Lake

1051
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Concussion

1052
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
Symptoms include memory loss

1053
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Bouts of anger

1054
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
In this case

1055
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
It

1056
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Was

1057
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Depression it was

1058
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Suicidal Thoughts

1059
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
It was

1060
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,127
Everything was at other family member saying hey have you noticed

1061
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
There was it

1062
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,015
He himself saying I I don't feel right with everybody else

1063
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
It was getting

1064
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Phone call

1065
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
Like hey I need you

1066
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Come get him

1067
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Because

1068
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
He's having dangerous

1069
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
And at that very time

1070
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Knowing that

1071
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
I wouldn't sign

1072
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
What's going on there

1073
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
Cuz that's what we do

1074
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
It's almost like a split personality

1075
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
Registering him

1076
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
For football

1077
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
Was just as natural

1078
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,247
Is getting up every morning and brushing my teeth

1079
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Then you have the other half

1080
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
As a

1081
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Mother

1082
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Daughter

1083
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Nice

1084
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
Of NFL athletes

1085
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
Who sees what happens on the flip

1086
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
Emma Parker was playing the

1087
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,631
Part of her that did see what happens on the flipside.

1088
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:07,519
That part would campaign to raise awareness of CTE was other parents I was on a mission

1089
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,103
I met with people I was doing health fairs

1090
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Helping creator

1091
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
Pamphlet that would go out

1092
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Meanwhile

1093
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
Since Parker was playing

1094
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
My dad knows

1095
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,063
It really your dad to my dad is now showing

1096
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Science

1097
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
My dad just turned 70

1098
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
And

1099
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
You know it

1100
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
I'm seeing it now with his

1101
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Speech

1102
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
With his thought pattern

1103
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
You know running backs what are you do manually with the head up

1104
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,935
You know

1105
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,215
But I can't

1106
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
That myself

1107
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
From wanting my son to play football it's

1108
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
Just a crate I can't I can't even explain it

1109
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,175
If you wanted to

1110
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
Play I would

1111
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
Be out there that he would be at practice

1112
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
You don't even

1113
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,135
Who tosses the ball around with him in the yard hoping that he'll fall in love

1114
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Football

1115
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,975
Jasper Parker I asked Parker

1116
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Prodigy like

1117
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
The season

1118
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
His favorite things

1119
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
Where the trophy and the pizza pie

1120
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
Had no desire

1121
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
You want to play again next season

1122
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Now

1123
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
This past year

1124
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
Or last

1125
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
Hey Parker do you want to play this year

1126
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
No

1127
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
How to play soccer

1128
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Would you

1129
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
Bring up the LA when would an ex

1130
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Possible season beef

1131
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Well

1132
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,807
Registration is in June

1133
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,463
And this would be what kind of

1134
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Is 8

1135
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Yeah

1136
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
I don't want

1137
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
Himtoo

1138
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
If he decides to

1139
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
To play the game

1140
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
If not

1141
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
Begrudgingly

1142
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
But that's okay

1143
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,663
I don't want to force him to play especially this

1144
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Early

1145
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,271
So I stand firm on both sides

1146
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
The debate

1147
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,903
I know that's what makes it ridiculous

1148
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Eyes

1149
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
Stanford

1150
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:05,023
That children should not play football

1151
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
I also stand

1152
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Confirm that

1153
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
Children should play football

1154
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
That it's a great

1155
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Sport

1156
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,727
The current solution to this quandary

1157
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,615
So now we're out there

1158
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Where am I

1159
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
This year

1160
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:26,015
We're dedicated teacher about a pick maybe soccer such a bad bad idea

1161
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,855
Show all the kickers came from soccer

1162
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,927
There's no black kickers there's no black punters

1163
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Even the kicker

1164
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Every so often

1165
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
But there is a stiff

1166
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,791
Death penalty for that it was 50

1167
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,423
About this point in the conversation

1168
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
Parker him up from school

1169
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055

Hey there partner

1173
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,479
I'm not exactly sure how an 8 year old should look but

1174
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
He's pretty big kid

1175
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Come sit with me

1176
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367

00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,927
So do you know why I came to talk to you

1178
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:07,999
Why

1179
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
All about football

1180
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,423
I play I play for about

1181
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
6 week

1182
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
I think

1183
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,591
Cuz you just went really that into it

1184
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
No I just still on the only reason I don't want to play it anymore is because I made someone swallow dirt and like

1185
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,343
That's not his kind of messing up my history and I don't want to get anyone else hurt

1186
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,183
Nothing of your history yeah it's just messing up history in my life

1187
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,559
Batman UK I don't know what that means was that mean

1188
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:48,447
It's like messing up it's making me have bad memories on have good memories

1189
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,287
I like trying to make someone swallow dirt

1190
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
Benefield

1191
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735
It was an accident I just tackled him and I happened

1192
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Did you feel bad about it right away or you just feel bad about now and he

1193
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,391
I feel bad about it every time I say

1194
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Back

1195
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Really

1196
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
I thought I heard somebody

1197
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Crying yourself

1198
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
I thought I heard

1199
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Tears

1200
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,327
Airsoft gun

1201
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Do you like watching

1202
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
Football

1203
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,383
No I'm not that into football like the rest of my family

1204
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,455
I usually think about just having fun

1205
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
And not winning

1206
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Where'd you get that

1207
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
No I just know that

1208
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,183
Winning stats for people trying to be better than everyone in bowling

1209
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Winner

1210
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
No Lake

1211
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Mom

1212
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
That's what I mean

1213
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
It's trying to have fun

1214
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
Not just to be rude to

1215
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,775
When you win all you're going to do is like take a trophy and say you're better than them

1216
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
It's not

1217
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Fair to the other

1218
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
Do you like other sports

1219
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
I really want to do synchronized

1220
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
Is that true

1221
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
Is that true

1222
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,559
Mostly because when I saw something about it

1223
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
Kind of cool like

1224
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,215
People are doing a lot of cool swimming tricks so I kind of thought it was

1225
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Something for me

1226
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,079
Just you playing me

1227
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,735
Synchronized swimming you like you're like this hasn't come talk to me about football and I'm going to tell him that I

1228
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
I want to do synchronized swimming

1229
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
I know you like it

1230
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,135
Oh yes I'm going to do.

1231
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
He likes this

1232
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
They said swimming

1233
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,767
But I guess you don't have to worry about that I would be a team sport

1234
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Yeah

1235
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
Why was kind of exhausting

1236
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
We can stop

1237
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,567
Big Smo name Parker Bartell for letting

1238
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:07,967
Legs or invade their home in exhaust them on short notice and by the way when when I went back and I counted all the relatives that

1239
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,271
I've been in the NFL it wasn't 33

1240
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Louis XIII

1241
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
That's still at the lot

1242
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Any case

1243
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,903
Here's a logical question that we felt like we should ask

1244
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
Ask Ellie somewhere

1245
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
In the show

1246
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
Given tags experience

1247
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
Hayward football

1248
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,071
Practically his Birthright but he is opting out

1249
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,375
Are there a lot of Tanks

1250
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
Out there

1251
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,215
Like it is football the sport tanking

1252
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,751
Nationally generally

1253
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
Where's Molly Webster Define

1254
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,359
Funny when one of my friends become tank

1255
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,895
But that's cuz he can drink a lot

1256
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,831
My dad can't remember his name just goes that tank fellow

1257
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
Still drink a lot

1258
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:53,279
In nek I started making some calls High School coaches hey can you hear me

1259
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:59,935
Winning teams losing teams on the bigger picture I called this guy

1260
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:04,543
Brian Marcellus Wallace in and I am a freelance sports reporter

1261
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,383
I don't know what you want to name the places where I

1262
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:15,551
Disename in freelance sports writer

1263

She was an intern at the Wall Street Journal

1264
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Sports.

1265
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
In my first week

1266
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,999
A article was published on ESPN that

1267
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
Suggested based on Philly Pop Warner youth football numbers

1268
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,959
Person Pop Warner but he is a Youth Football League

1269
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,079
Based on Philly Pop Warner youth football numbers Youth Football was declining

1270
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
Felt pretty significantly

1271
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
Do you remember what the what the drop was around 5% a year between 2000

1272
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,111
Had in 2012 when people saw these numbers they were like oh my God

1273
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
Why exactly

1274
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
5% doesn't sound too bad well I mean if you assume that the 5% drop doesn't change that's what address by ever

1275
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,375
Every year than in 15 years you're in the neighborhood of like

1276
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
50% less kids playing ball

1277
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
Wow

1278
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,103
If this is true it's about the end of football

1279
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Pop Warner than they're not going to middle school

1280
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:18,527
Football you're not going to high school football not going to college football so they're not going to the NFL

1281
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:24,159
Needless to say everyone is like oh my God is this actually true or is there more to these numbers than meets the eye

1282
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,487
The rain starts digging into them

1283
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
To put them in

1284
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,535
And he

1285
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,143
Doesn't look just it pop warner numbers he looks at all the Youth Football League

1286
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,471
And what I began to realize was that

1287
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,287
Big drop wasn't as drastic

1288
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,847
But if there was indeed a truck

1289
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
Business because everyone was saying all right

1290
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,455
Okay your relief will be short-lived

1291
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,807
Because because there's a bigger story

1292
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,927
Moon rhyme with the participation across all Youth Sports not just football

1293
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,767
I came back with noted drops in all

1294
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
The biggest youth sports

1295
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:08,447
It's not just the footballs everything's decreasing or nothing was Rising except for lacrosse

1296
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
Emperor haki

1297
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,775
Edline

1298
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Kids are playing sports

1299
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
Football gets all of the attention

1300
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,783
Hope all gets all of the controversy you don't really hear about basketball and soccer or baseball so you know

1301
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,623
You don't have any reason to think that those Sports aren't still as healthy as they've always been

1302
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
But then

1303
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
When you go and look

1304
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,767
UCI drop that is comprable to the drop

1305
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,607
And the sport that's got everybody's hair on fire and you just

1306
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,935
Wonder why this has been going on for silently

1307
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,983
Is this an extension of the whole concussion thing

1308
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:48,383
Yes concussions were definitely part of the conversation but so were you know budget issues and kids

1309
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,687
Specializing in sports and getting burnt out

1310
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:55,551
Are basically everyone had two reasons and every school has their reasons but the guys I talk to

1311
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,087
And it'll

1312
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:02,975
Kept coming back to land on this point that had nothing to do with safety

1313
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Today is

1314
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
Kingdom like the score

1315
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
He just hits restart

1316
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,167
He just starts the game over cuz I can get on a video game

1317
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:17,567
They can play they start losing their hit reset hit the button and play another game they just hit a button start

1318
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,967
JT Curtis JJ Woodward and George Salas there in Louisiana California and Kansas and I heard this refer

1319
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:29,087
Find not just from them but I heard this in Ohio I heard this in Michigan and by this point I was like

1320
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
Jesus

1321
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,695
It's funny cuz it's as if

1322
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,791
All the coaches all across the nation are reading the same book

1323
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
Or going to the same bar or something because

1324
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,423
I'm literally everyone I talked to his brought this up

1325
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,751
Is it just that everyone said it to each other so much that it's

1326
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,359
I can tell you that's not it at all it's it's because we all deal with the problem

1327
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:56,735
So all this cuz I talked to her like you can't go hit reset you can't hit reset you can't hit reset like

1328
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
These kids are used to like

1329
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:04,927
It's like if I sound so old they're basically saying that what they find is they feel like there's some some

1330
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Commitment issues

1331
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,767
I've only play if I win I only want to win

1332
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,375
Yeah so the interesting thing was is the coaches I talked with the PowerHouse schools

1333
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,191
We're not actually having trouble getting kids

1334
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
Because we win

1335
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,519
But the other schools in the

1336
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
The conference

1337
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,335
Stay know that coaches athletic director

1338
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,639
She's not talk to some schools that had for fitting

1339
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:31,551
Ends up forfeiting games they said like you just don't get the kids that will work their asses off and ride the bench

1340
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,855
Everybody wants to win it just somehow it seems like that

1341
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
Expect to win or isn't worth the effort or it's just that there are so many options like why would you choose the losing apps

1342
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
Used to go home

1343
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
After school

1344
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,119
I turn the TV on

1345
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
Nursery channels

1346
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
So I had

1347
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,215
And they usually wishon soap operas

1348
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:55,359
So there was really no reason I will add no reason to stay home now you go home there's a hundred

1349
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,431
50 stations you can find something you want to watch

1350
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,711
Or you get out

1351
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Again

1352
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,879
Alright so whether it you think it's video games or parenting or

1353
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Sheriff

1354
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
Cushing's or whatever

1355
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
Reason you want to choose

1356
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
23 largest good happens

1357
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,303
These conversations about sports like

1358
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,679
Football is it it doesn't actually seem to be about football it's like some kind of negotiation between the generation

1359
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Cuz like

1360
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
Back in the 1870s

1361
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
The harbor kids

1362
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:29,919
They were using footballs away to say back to the previous generation like look how tough we are looking manly we are

1363
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Maybe this generation

1364
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:36,319
Is turning away from sports like football also to say something back to

1365
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
The previous generation

1366
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
Something about the world they want to live in

1367
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Sport do

1368
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
Suggest thing

1369
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
About

1370
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,375
Society and about reality

1371
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
That we are slowly trying

1372
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
To move

1373
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
Remove from exhaust

1374
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
I'm the idea that somehow

1375
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,127
Physicality matters more

1376
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
In the mine

1377
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
And that people really aren't equal

1378
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,527
And that if you yell at someone and challenge their manhood off

1379
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,831
I mean Albert masculinity of any kind

1380
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,903
It's not something that were in the mood to celebrate these days

1381
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
So it could be

1382
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:18,559
You believe ridership last minute it could be that some kids are choosing away from sports like football because

1383
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
To play football

1384
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,935
It means it on some level you have to

1385
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
Port

1386
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,519
At least entertaining ideas that you don't like

1387
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
No

1388
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,335
At least you don't admit that you like

1389
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Mitsubishi bits

1390
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,431
You Think You're Something unconscious about me

1391
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
That is drawn to

1392
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,599
The problems in the game that are based around what it really is

1393
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Which is a two dudes

1394
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
Slamming into yes

1395
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,815
Because you know I mean okay if this is like I'm doing can I get something pop psychology on myself

1396
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
But I

1397
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
I sometimes wonder if

1398
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
If

1399
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,567
Soho part of me

1400
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
Mrs.

1401
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
That

1402
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
From my life

1403
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
That you know that that my life

1404
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
Build around sitting in a

1405
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
Computer

1406
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
And avoiding

1407
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Conflict

1408
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
And basically thinking about things and

1409
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:23,839
Going on the radio and talking about what they might mean you know any sort of like where they metaphors for what is this culture what is it

1410
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
And that that

1411
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
That perhaps football

1412
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,447
Allows me to

1413
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
The sword of

1414
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,519
You know I'm not playing it I'm just watching it

1415
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,103
But somehow by watching it allows me to tap into something

1416
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,967
That is no longer part of my life because my mind has trained me not to want it

1417
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
My mind knows not to

1418
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,575
Look for conflict

1419
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
Now

1420
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
Do I

1421
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
Spectrum

1422
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
Socialized

1423
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,767
To believe that would be a

1424
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,047
Positive exciting thing

1425
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Absolutely

1426
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:59,935
I mean I you know I talked about sports with my father

1427
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,239
More than we talked about

1428
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,543
Every other thing we ever talked

1429
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
Regulation

1430
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,151
How you passed away am I love him in a great relationship

1431
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
But we definitely

1432
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,223
Spent more time

1433
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
Discussing Sports

1434
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,319
But I would say every other thing that we discussed even though you would always say

1435
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
It's like the most important thing he'd like

1436
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:24,767
From whatever you know and he would be like so how was school today and I would tell him what school was briefly and he would be like

1437
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,375
We know academics in the most important thing about football practice for an hour

1438
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,263
I realize that

1439
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:40,895
My relationship is Football goes back if you know my I have two older brothers man we spend so much time

1440
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
Throwing the football around

1441
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:46,015
And and and my brother one of my brothers were

1442
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,575
Very good football players in like one playlist

1443
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,111
College live on

1444
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:57,023
