I was dismissed I was only dismissed from the day I was dismissed from I'm not even supposed to come back to my whatever

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
How do you so elated and I was kind of mopey until

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
What's wrong with you

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
I like to read

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
So you're gone all day tomorrow no I'm not

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
I'm drunk

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Oh my God

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay if you want to do this tomorrow we could go if you want

36
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
That's good to know

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Okay so Robert

38
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
Where where do we start

39
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,152
But if you start where we left off right right where we left off we thought we had

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Simply the most fabulous

41
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Animal

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
Otherwise in the world champion of rainbows

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
South champion ring listen to Radiolab by the way

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,000
Roberts 07 issues ago we did a show about colors we had a very simple question

45
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Who

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
Among Us earthlings sees the best rainbow

47
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
We found a champion

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
And we're going to

49
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Reevaluate

50
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
That Carnation as time passes and science advances so

51
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
I think we should play the original segment

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Because it is Delight

53
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:06,880
Rifle you hear the crowning of the champion and then we should re-evaluate whether the champion deserve to be crowned

54
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
End of the the early segment it started with Robert ask a question to

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
Cognitive Scientist by the name of Mark Shane giese

56
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
But here's a question if a dog

57
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
And be human

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
And a

59
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,288
Crow we can be staring at a rainbow would they be seeing very different things

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Yes

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,712
Know this question that Robert is kind of tossed out during an interview

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
How different creature

63
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
See the rainbow

64
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
This ended up taking us down a little wormhole

65
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
We ended up actually getting a choir

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Dealt with illustrator

67
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
What we learned

68
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
But just a set of Baseline your normal rainbow goes like this

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Starting bottom up

70
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Red orange yellow green

71
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Blue violet roygbiv

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Reggie Bell

73
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Yea though I don't know why people put the i in there but that's it we didn't have the Indigo you couldn't say it though. That's why you need the IRS

74
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
That by the way is Tom Cronin

75
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
What's called a visual ecologist Mark suggest

76
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
McCall he told us that humans see

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Seven colors in the rainbow

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
And in the case of the dog

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Very different rainbow it's going to start off

80
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Blue hillbilly Seafood is fine

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
So it was here rainbow starting with blue

82
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
St. Louis CNN grading off into green

83
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Same for us

84
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
And then disappearing

85
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Give me the weather in there

86
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Video

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
That's it

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
Yeah so the rainbow the only good. Hafez

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
SRS wow

90
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Lucky rainbow

91
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,719
Dog that's why when God promised that he would never deliver another day lose a game

92
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,767
If I made the promise in a rainbow

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
The dogs 2 strip totally unimpressed

94
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
What is it about the dog I that

95
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Makes it see this way

96
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
It doesn't have

97
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Red sensitive

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
Photoreceptors no red sensitive cones

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,823
The weird thing is it the difference between dogs and us

100
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,431
It's just one they have cones tuned to blue and green so do we

101
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
We have this one extra

102
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Red

103
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
It's just a really seem like a big difference

104
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
It's just one call

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
But I have three

106
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
It's so much better than two that's janeites Vision scientist

107
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Because of this kind of multiplicative thing

108
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Redken get mixed

109
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
With blue

110
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Check purple

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Or red can get mixed with yellow

112
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
How to make orange

113
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
Green mixed with blue teal or turquoise

114
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
That's how we get about a hundred different shades

115
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Colors that we can see

116
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
2 by adding one photopigment instead of adding just

117
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
One more color you actually add about 98 colors

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Let's move on to now we have a

119
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
Pro unless you'd like to change the bird

120
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Well the crow is not so much because it's pretty much like us

121
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,351
Let's take a listen or something like a

122
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
A sparrow sparrows have ultraviolet vision

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
What did they say

124
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
So they see the rainbow starts before I remove starch for wheezing see Sky it would see in ultraviolet

125
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
What color

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
And then it would see the violet

127
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
That would see the blue

128
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
And the greens

129
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Les oranges

130
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
Is our first in your engine and then the writer probably would see

131
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Further into the red mask because I have

132
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
Amore red sensitive red receptor than we have

133
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,959
See a much broader rainbow would start earlier and it would end later

134
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,967
So should we assume that we've now that this Powers the champion but that's the that's that's as high as a guest if you're talking about

135
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Vertebrates

136
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,647
No I'm talking about anything that has a heart and a mind an advantage you leave the vertebrates then all bets are off you've got

137
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
Many animals have much better color vision than the vertebrate story

138
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Like butterflies or butterflies have five or six

139
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Kinds of

140
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Of color receptors we only have

141
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Tree ring

142
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
Butterfly see more colors than we do

143
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Yeah

144
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
So if a butterfly release

145
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
King of the rainbow

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,015
Butterflies are out there when we see colors we have no names

147
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,879
For between the blues and the greens and the greens on the yellow so it would go from

148
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
Ultraviolet would see that then it would see violet

149
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
And then

150
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Blue

151
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
MN blue green

152
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
Yep in green green Bluey Bluey or whatever

153
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
Brighten an orange and red and all that

154
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
I have very complicated eyes

155
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
Okay so just to recap

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Here's the dog

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Givens

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Now the Sparrow

159
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Lil bit more bass look more high-end

160
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
To speak finally

161
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
The butterfly

162
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Just so you know not so far about this. What's got more meds in there

163
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
So I'm not thinking butterfly butterflies get the crown

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Yeah but

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
Then you go on the coral reefs you come across

166
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
These animals called mantis shrimp

167
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
Where they called metal like mantis like a praying mantis

168
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,687
It was from catches prey using an arm like a praying mantis has

169
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
Shrimps are barn mostly pretty small about the size of a finger some get to be as big as your forearm

170
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Big big animals

171
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,023
My God they're so colorful know they are colorful though

172
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Your hair look at this

173
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
It's like they're Electric

174
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
And I like turquoise

175
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
And their eyes are like a little cartoon eyes

176
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Gigantic

177
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,103
Yeah they have two really big eyes right on the front and you said the dogs have

178
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Two cones we have

179
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
How much does a butterfly have again

180
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Butterflies V

181
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Depends on the butterfly

182
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Mantis shrimp have 16

183
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
Teen dies of receptors what would the rainbow look like to them

184
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
They live in very shallow water and so the water is pretty clear almost like

185
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,215
They would start the rainbow way way way inside where we see Violet they would say

186
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
Extraordinarily deep

187
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Ultraviolet

188
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,199
And then they would go on through as several kinds of ultraviolet that's probably five or six kinds of ultraviolet

189
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
I never get to Violet with

190
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Not reaching our colors

191
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
And go through Violet and violet

192
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
Blue and blue and blue green

193
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
Will they have those green green blue blue blue as well

194
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
Then they would go out to the Reds

195
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
So they would be about it at that as red as ice when I got to the red end but only in the bed

196
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
What are rainbow that must

197
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Yeah

198
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
They have the most complicated visual system of any animals

199
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Factor of two or

200
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Wait wait wait

201
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
He said any

202
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,415
Do you mean it means you may not unequivocally any other animals that we know of

203
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Has a visual system

204
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Within 50%

205
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
It's complicated

206
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Alright mantis

207
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
But you know on the other hand their brains are

208
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Hiney so who knows

209
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,871
What the time in tubes they may not have the ability for

210
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Save the beauty of the

211
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
No I don't I don't know they're there

212
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Venice turn into violence

213
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Around in Spanish

214
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Chill things

215
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
That's what they do that's that's one reason

216
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
So fascinating about how to go around

217
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,303
What what are the shells on crabs other many shrimps shrimps

218
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
Octopuses octopuses

219
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Yeah small ones

220
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
A good-sized mantis shrimp

221
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Can break the wall of an aquarium

222
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
What really

223
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799

And we shared a moment

241
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863

This is Radiolab on Jedi

285
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Okay so we did the thing about the mantis shrimp

286
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
And

287
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Partially because of Us Part 2

288
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
Because I think just the world was ready

289
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
The Mantis

290
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Shrimp has become a little bit of a celebrity animal

291
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,023
Popular a little looking but elevated in cartoon

292
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
Has had its moments deservedly so when you think about what we know

293
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
What is rods and cones apparently are able to appreciate ya know you just want to close your eyes and imagine

294
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,455
Whatever it is that animal might be seeing just seven years ago

295
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
What's happens

296
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
The science keeps going

297
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
One of the things that happened recently in the last few years is that the people who study the mantis shrimp

298
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
They have released

299
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
More knowledge

300
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
About what it might be seeing

301
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
And

302
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
We're going to update you on that on that right now

303
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
But first can I just tell you something

304
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
Actually got to meet a mantis shrimp a cultist

305
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,335
Very very recently in Brooklyn and Coney Island

306
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Oh yeah I have dreamt of this moment

307
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
My say

308
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
To the Mantis isn't one of these tanks

309
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,087
Producer Amanda narancic and I we found a fish store at Coney Island

310
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Then actually had a real life mantis

311
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
Hahaha hello

312
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Wow

313
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
It looks exactly as I imagined it

314
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
Intel wow they're so cool

315
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Viewster tucked away in an aquarium in the corner of the Tsar dimly-lit shop at the shop is run by this guy

316
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
Excellence and this is your store

317
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
And how long have you been here for years

318
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Chris cells are all kinds of

319
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Signs of brittle starfish

320
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Different kinds of clownfish

321
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
We have designer clownfish

322
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Have you ever heard of designer clownfish

323
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Have you heard this

324
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
Apparently these fashion designers are designing new clownfish

325
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
I also would like you have a Gucci

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Yeah definitely

327
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,567
Just a little weird fish fact any Outback to the Mantis it was in the corner of the shop in this

328
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
Aquarium of reinforced glass

329
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
We actually got someone from Sri Lanka

330
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
This man

331
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Sri Lanka

332
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
This is one of the stranger creatures I've ever seen

333
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
And have you ever seen one of these things of closer

334
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
Very very stunningly call my God

335
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
Oh my God lyrics just a minute

336
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,071
Particularly color

337
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
This is a particular guy that we saw he was

338
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,983
Hiding in a tube in the middle of the aquarium this was a peacock mantis shrimp cuz they're called

339
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
So if you can imagine

340
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
Like it's got if they're big first of all there like 7 in or so

341
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
So that's a big creature

342
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
And I

343
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
If you can imagine the head of a hermit crab

344
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Painted like a peacock

345
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,879
Stuck on the bright green slithering body of a miniature dragon

346
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,279
That's what it looks like

347
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
Swiveling in all different directions and they have these really big googly eyes

348
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Mantis shrimp

349
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Sitting in a

350
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Lucite tube

351
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
And it's looking out at the world

352
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,407
Treating the two blankets his home bro which we were headed in the wild

353
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Especially looking for something to eat

354
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,575
You can see the voice you just heard that Tom Cronin are mantis expert from the last segment

355
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
He's your salesperson

356
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Health science

357
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,071
He drove down from Baltimore to meet us and remember when he was telling us in the last segment

358
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
While ago that the Manchester these violent little bastards

359
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
They love to go around and kill things

360
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Yes he was not kidding

361
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
I just want to look describes to you before we talk about the vision

362
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
I was staring

363
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Hat

364
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
Peacock mantis shrimp huddled in the tube in an aquarium

365
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Chris is about to

366
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
What's the poor little blue thing that you were about to put in

367
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
We're actually going to be a damsel fish

368
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:06,207
Is there Point Chris drops in this little blue fish looks a little bit like Dory from that movie

369
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
America's

370
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Ingested into the mantle

371
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
Stanco Fishers in

372
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
Another fish is sensibly hiding in the back

373
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Fish is hiding behind the tube at the fish should

374
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Little Dory fish swim around for like

375
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
I don't know 5 minutes trying to find a way out

376
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
The whole time the Mantis was like I see, I'm just chilling in its 2 and then

377
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
Launched out of it to but then

378
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,791
Well that was just so sudden

379
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,399
Ice cream

380
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
You know cuz they have these claws on the front of their body that they used

381
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,543
Punch their prey and you can literally hear the snap

382
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
From across the room

383
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,455
And then he and this is sad he then took a lap and then came back in and just full

384
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Just punch the fish a few more times

385
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Oh wow that's

386
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
That's

387
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
It's a hard ending for that

388
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Fort Collins now

389
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,839
It's one of those like nature moments where you're sort of amazed but you'll see

390
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
I want to cry

391
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
What's up

392
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,263
It's okay. Let's talk about efficient cleaning his eyes now

393
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,895
After it killed the Fish Shack went back to his tooth and started kind of like scrubbing his eyeballs with its little

394
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Russia's important thing

395
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Houses like did you see what I did to that fish

396
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
No checking my eyes

397
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
And ask her what those I see our notion of that is totally changed over the last few years so

398
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
That another marine biologist that Amanda talk to

399
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Do you mind introducing yourself

400
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
To me like a my name is

401
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
Professor Rosalind this is what I do for a living

402
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
How do you want to do that

403
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
Now is good

404
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Hello my name is Justin Rose wife

405
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,295
Marine biologist Anthony are scientist working on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia

406
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
Just for contact he Justin is the guy who basically put the Mantis on the map

407
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Kia

408
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
He was the first guy his lab was the first laptop

409
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,631
To notice that they saw color at all

410
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
The University of Sussex

411
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
The 1995-96 apparently he had a

412
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:32,383
Colleague from West Africa who's wearing particular dress colorful traditional dress

413
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
She walks in his lab where he's got all the aquariums and immediately all the matches sugar rush to the beginning of the Korean War like hey

414
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
She walked in and went wild

415
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
What does that mean they started waving the appendages and

416
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Shuffle that colors now that I know a little bit about mantis shrimp so I know exactly what they were saying to I reach would be entirely inappropriate

417
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,679
They were turned on

418
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
Colorful thing what should we do

419
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
So just was a guy that basically proved

420
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
Okay these animals have color vision

421
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
Fantasy color he confirm that with this

422
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
Experiment with colored containers you can get them to just

423
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
Bait Living Daylights Outta that thing that's colorful

424
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Focus I love to smash

425
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Sonia that was all background here's a new for me

426
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Recently

427
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Justin and his lab decided to ask a new question

428
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
He decided to say all right

429
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
These all these shrimp they have so many rods and cones in their eye

430
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
And by the way he would say they were 12

431
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Which is still

432
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
4 times a week

433
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
How well do they use them

434
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
What that means how well do

435
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,688
Do they usually have them they must use them for something

436
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
Flexeril like if you're a scientist you can't just ask

437
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Soon the day

438
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,112
See things the way that we see things don't mean you have to make sure

439
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
So I mean you know you is simple question to start off with

440
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
How well do they see different shades of the same color

441
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
Kind of thing that we do at the grocery store all the time

442
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
So you know if you got take a banana from her stool

443
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
Even if you pick one that's just going yellow

444
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,336
Still a little bit green not yellow enough to Yellow you know you use your eyes to make

445
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Call wunderkinder shrimp

446
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Can this animal distinguish

447
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Between discharge of red and black China

448
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Is blue and black

449
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
Can they make this fine distinction

450
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
I assume so

451
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah because they got all the rods and cones right if they weren't putting them to some extraordinary

452
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Obvious use would be

453
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,168
More blue or more exactly what do you want to be sure

454
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Mantis shrimp I'm going to give you

455
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Food from this yellow thing

456
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
So what did it basically is that you would show the shrimp yellow light give him some food

457
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Little lights

458
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
Food yellow light food they quickly learned that yellow means food

459
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Cool so then he shows the shrimp

460
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
A blue light where there is no food and naturally the foods with the yellow it's not with the flu

461
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Mosto

462
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Most can do this

463
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,560
But then he would gradually make the blue side to non-food side

464
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
A little more yellow Berry graduate

465
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
He would shift the color from Blue

466
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
32 Bluegreen

467
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Green

468
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Then green yellow just to see if

469
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
The shrimp could tell the difference between yellow which means

470
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Food

471
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
And yellow Greenwich

472
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
Doesn't mean food that's what we did and we expect

473
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Get the mattress room to have

474
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Tophatter

475
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
Distinction of that sort of level

476
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
I was surprised

477
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
To find that it was the worst animal on the planet so far Chester

478
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
No

479
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Now you're exaggerating

480
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Are champion

481
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Of the rainbow

482
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
What's the worst creature ever test

483
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
The worst so

484
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
In other words

485
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,592
Nature gives them a panoply of choice and then they

486
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
Can't tell the difference that which the point of that there something wrong with this Theory

487
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
Can I say you come to my pants. I'm going to show you 50 shades of purple

488
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Are you can only see three then what are you doing in there like I don't know what you did they seem to have the equipment to see all the purple

489
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
All the colors

490
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
All the Many Many Shades but

491
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
Still they got these amazing ice they just don't seem to use them

492
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
The way that we do

493
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
I don't understand that

494
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Yeah okay

495
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
So this is why you need to stop thinking about

496
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Coloring

497
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
What colors are according to just Marshall the basic thing to understand is that you don't actually see color with your eyes I mean you take

498
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Taking the light with your eyes

499
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
But then the color is rain in Ukraine

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
And

501
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
They have these little insect braids

502
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
That don't

503
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
Seemed to do color the way that our brains to the right which way

504
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
See color is

505
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
If I see a thing

506
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
That's a somebody wearing a blue sweater walking down the street

507
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Nice-looking

508
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,776
Lady or gentleman wearing a blue thing at my blue Furniture except in my eye

509
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Gets really excited

510
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
Tell your brains going to see that blue

511
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Ugly sweater right now

512
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
If that blue sweater had a little bit of red in it

513
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
The red

514
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
Photoreceptor would also buzz but not as loud

515
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
The ratio of those expectations

516
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Gives my brain

517
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Sensational

518
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,512
All right got a lot of blue a little bit of red what could that be

519
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Wechat

520
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
That's what you end up seeing like your brain

521
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Sarah Paints the gap

522
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
And that's how every animal on the planet Ceres color

523
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Except for my

524
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
It's brain doesn't seem that interested

525
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
In

526
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Painting Gap

527
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,504
So back in their segments when we said it sees a full

528
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Throated

529
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
WYD

530
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
Boise spectrum of color

531
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Like this

532
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Static

533
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,048
Glorious Vision best rainbow view of all creatures on Earth that we said that's what he said

534
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
More

535
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
More

536
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
Variety in the rainbow then we can or than anybody

537
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
That was at

538
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
That was our thought we might need to amend that

539
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
How do you say

540
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
They still see

541
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Colors that we don't see

542
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
But they might not just be seen as many colors as

543
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Maybe there rainbow

544
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
Is more a series of

545
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,552
Of rather focused

546
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
Discrete bands of color with not allowed in between

547
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,304
I am very very

548
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Extraordinarily puzzle

549
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
They're given the equipment that we used to

550
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
To see

551
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Various

552
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:23,360
Shades of color and they don't use it to see shades of color what are they use it to see what they use it to

553
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
I mean this is all speculative but

554
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
Tom Cronin was telling us in the fish shop that liked

555
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
The science seems to be heading towards the

556
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
This idea

557
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Did they use colors to communicate

558
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,304
If that's the case that you don't need to see all the colors they just need to see the ones that mean something

559
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
At least in the ultraviolet there's really good evidence that way it's not

560
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,960
It's not public so I don't want to talk about too much cuz it's not my work

561
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
But it looks like

562
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
Different parts of the UV have very different meanings like one part might being

563
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Fear

564
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
Don't go there another lightning

565
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Sex

566
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
I'd like to get to know more about this

567
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,928
Maybe another part means home who knows certainly very

568
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
Species to species were talking about the whole Rangers

569
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
At least 500 species start

570
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
You should have blank

571
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
Explanation is a bit simple

572
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
But what you're saying is that

573
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
Instead of seeing rainbows there

574
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
There are having a conversation with

575
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,128
Yeah maybe they just vocabulary

576
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,224
They have all these rods and cones so they can talk to the world not so they can

577
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
See the beauty

578
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,600
And this is complicated but they have that they can do polarized light

579
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
Oh

580
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
So hard to

581
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:46,304
But apparently thought that some species can Flash polarized light at each other as a way of communicating

582
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
Somehow I'm not even going to try and explain that cuz I don't get it

583
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
They are

584
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
An unbelievably

585
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Amazing

586
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
And

587
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Different cysts

588
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Any other item on the

589
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
You got to ask yourself

590
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Question

591
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
And I've been asking myself that question

592
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Society is

593
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
And I guess I'm a

594
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Cuz I still have knots

595
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
You could call me a failed

596
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
I don't think we're going to do that

597
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Already have that is not really true

598
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
If you had to distill

599
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
The new information that you had that you have how would you

600
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Explain it like

601
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,936
That the thing that we know now that we didn't know 10 years ago is

602
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Is this

603
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,456
What I'm left with at the end of the day

604
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
I mean you know

605
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
Yeah it has eyes

606
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,624
Are we have eyes we assumed its eyes do for it would all right do for us but I

607
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,488
Apparently not and I don't think a choir is going to bridge this Gap that's what's called

608
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,376
Likes like every animal in the world lives with its own senses any world that is defined by those senses

609
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,448
Heading away it's one of those tragic things that is true

610
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Try as you will

611
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
You will never know what a bat

612
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Knows when it activates you will never know

613
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
What a deer

614
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
When it looks out if we know that deer don't

615
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:12,320
CR and that's why all the Hunters wear bright orange and the others don't see that range do they see more of something else I don't know

616
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Baidu what's an envelope

617
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
It's umw

618
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
It's a great word whose else

619
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
It's the word that says

620
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
That you are limited by what you can

621
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Can

622
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Feel touch

623
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Mlc

624
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Yeah

625
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:34,080
On some level I mean I feel like that's a problem that exists even between people like I have regular

626
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,616
Thomas with my wife Round Lake

627
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
That's not blue and she said yes totally blew it all the time

628
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
What you're seeing right now

629
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
I know

630
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
That's the lonely part

631
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
The unlonely part

632
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Is that you can try

633
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Yeah

634
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
That is

635
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
It is really fun to try

636
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,392
The original mantis shrimp episode was pretty

637
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
This by Tim Howard and Pat Walters

638
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
And updated by a producer Amanda around check recording the choir the second time around

639
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:33,472
Sound and to Chris Martin from creative grandma and the young New Yorkers chorus

640
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
And they have quite a range

641
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,384
Pancetta

642
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Thanks for listening

643
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
One final note

644
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
After we wrapped up this episode

645
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
We learned that

646
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
One of the members of our shrimp choir

647
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
Baritone by the name of Daniel Thompson

648
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,232
Was one of the five people who died in the tragic

649
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Helicopter

650
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Accident

651
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,584
That happened over the East River

652
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
This past Sunday night

653
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,472
Wechat Radiolab or devastated to hear this news and we're sending our thoughts

654
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
His family into the rest

655
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
To the choir

656
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,824
We would like to dedicate this episode to him
