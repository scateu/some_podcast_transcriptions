Radio WNYC

Daytime Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich

Greenbridge

00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Jordan 13

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,920
Three or four years ago I taking the bus down to Delaware and I

13
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Satanist

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
Crappy hotel and then woke up

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Super early like 5 a.m. still dark out to hop in his cap

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
You got me really excited let me tell you I just started working

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Radiolab this is like my first first time I didn't send out to like to just go out and get paid

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
Can anybody lives on that be so glad it's over

19
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Awesome

20
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
And the whole reason

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,128
Why I was headed down to this beach with to record myself

22
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
Communing with

23
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Horseshoe crab

24
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,904
Have you ever held one looks as if I've never had one in my hands I would love to hold one in my hand

25
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
Why are you so very far away right now it's fine

26
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
Down to that Beach

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
Because a few weeks

28
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Earlier alright everybody say something

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
Hello hello hello Robert my head

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,128
Should have fallen into this Rabbit Hole hello we'd spoken with a guy named Alexis Madrigal

31
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Who is a staff writer at the Atlantic how did you get on to horseshoe crabs where did that start do

32
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Late at night I was reading through the site where all these crazy press releases are published called Eureka alert

33
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Dot-com

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,048
And I happen to see this really tiny study

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Which had the on promising name

36
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Sublethal behavioral and physiological effects of the biomedical bleeding process on the American horseshoe

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Crab

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Limulus polyphemus

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
And I thought this is going to be my big story this and then I went and I did

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Did that thing that we do now you know horseshoe crab and then Google Images they're on the

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
Screen going to Alexis he saw

42
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
These pictures of a bunch of

43
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Horseshoe crabs

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Kind of propped up on these metal racks

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
And they were all kind of

46
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Tied in place

47
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
They are on the row and they all

48
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
Had these thin little plastic tubes coming out of their shells

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,360
All them and underneath them are what look like kind of a 2 liter bottle

50
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
And

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
There's blue blood in it

52
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Blue

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Baby blue blood

54
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
And the strain blood

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,560
It turned out to be the least interesting part of the story like that sound level like it just the visual that draws you in

56
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Because inside their strange blood

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
The horseshoe crabs have a kind of superpower

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,336
It's one that is help them survive hundreds of millions of years at the Earth is changed

59
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
As other species have come and gone and

60
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Challenge has been saving their butt

61
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
What is in Saving hours

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
For decades

63
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
Nearly all of modern medicine would not be possible

64
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Without this

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Special little thing in their blood

66
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
But

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
You might all be about to change

68
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Oh wow oh what are you doing over there

69
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Is really cool is it like has a

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Prom

71
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,664
The sex prom Every Spring I was no we should do we should all go together

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
It's it's it's in June and it's on the first moon of June Lexus you want to go

73
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
I do want to go

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Let's go

75
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
Which is where I come in test test test test test

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
Right cuz it ain't being that Robert and Alexis and I actually couldn't go and that it was like okay then send it send

77
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
The new guy you know

78
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,751
No I mean at the time it was like you were just Milling around the office

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
And you look like maybe you needed it Adventure

80
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
So we like hey do you want to go see these crabs like to see the sex run

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Yeah yeah yeah

82
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,855
So anyways so I go and then when I got there it was

83
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,207
Still pretty early like maybe six 7 in the morning it was

84
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Little bit rainy

85
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
But

86
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
When you walked

87
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,119
Down the beach it was just littered and in probably

88
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:58,495
Thousands of horseshoe crab

89
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Yeah there's no way that

90
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,711
We just we get a visual like what does a horseshoe crab look like

91
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,087
Like a semicircle and then there's kind of like this French Shield apart and then there's that

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
Hill and a catcher's mitt

93
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
So there were these hordes of

94
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Scotland catcher's mitts

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:28,191
Got laying around and they improve really slowly

96
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
The Eliza may be knocked upside down by the waves

97
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
And you could see their soft underbelly that these 10

98
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Lobster like legs

99
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
And then walking around them

100
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Wer

101
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
A bunch of people

102
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
Many of them were from a big pharmaceutical company which will make sense

103
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
A second but my guide for this morning on the beach was a guy named

104
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Glen Glen Cove short hair while wearing socks in sand

105
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
And I'm the founder and director of the ecologically research and development group

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:16,575
I think I saw that you were the Airforce I was

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Controller

108
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
And the first time I saw her she cries was in 1969 when I was stationed at Dover Air Force Base

109
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
Being a young guy coming down to the beach

110
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
Looking for something that might be going on and that's all horseshoe crabs it was until many years later that I

111
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
Kind of looped around into this thing but that was the first time I saw the

112
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Certain kind of weirdly fell in love with them

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
And I became really they're like Champion you're not all that attractive

114
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
She been around in a while I find them quite beautiful

115
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Glenn now leads is

116
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,231
You know Educational Tours of horseshoe crabs are especially at this time of the year

117
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
And he walked me up and down the beach

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,911
Painstakingly explaining to me the rules of the you know what the sex problem

119
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
The larger ones

120
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,823
At one point he pointed out two crabs that were stuck together

121
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Attached to that female

122
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
That's his gal now locked to one another

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Duck

124
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Tie-down

125
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Which makes it harder for them to write themselves

126
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Right now is surf is rough enough

127
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Off where they were

128
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
There's a good chance

129
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Would flip them over

130
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
And they be okay

131
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
But because he's

132
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Hanging in there

133
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
The likelihood of that hat

134
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Becomes more remote

135
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
But he'll die with her

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Seems like a blockbuster Ronin

137
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
I had to go back to remember

138
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,871
Burt Lancaster on the beach and I forget what movie that was

139
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
The ways

140
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
You're crashing over and that was symbolic of the romance

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
They were both

142
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Open bathing suits

143
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Do you know embrace

144
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Sing one another

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Nobody

146
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,975
So we we've got to go to an animal world version

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
No. Going on

148
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,839
Glenn's romantic I just painted this

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
Sex orgy as a beautiful

150
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
Flowering like a meeting season like

151
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Spring in nature kind of a beautiful thing

152
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,175
But I'm really really quickly was like

153
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
What are those know that's gross

154
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
The reality of it was kind of horrified

155
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
There be like

156
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
Isles of crabs trying to have sex with each other Big Dreams of them all

157
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
All hooked together

158
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,375
And it would be like going in the wrong direction all the time like

159
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
You'd see like one crab in the middle like a female like a bigger one

160
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
Call stripping and then three or four males like all trying to mate with this one crowd at the same time

161
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Heading when you look even closer

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,855
It turned out the female crab was dead

163
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Like this weird like

164
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Necrophiliac

165
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
For some of crabs

166
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
It was it was pretty

167
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Raunchy actually

168
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
My glasses are getting old

169
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
But while I was standing watching all this

170
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
You know hurly-burly of crab sex

171
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
I was struck by what I think is one of the central questions of the story

172
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Migas

173
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
It's almost impossible not to notice that

174
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Oh yeah

175
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,511
A lot of these horseshoe crabs are really banged up

176
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,143
Oh yeah I goes right through like chunks of their shells are missing their eyes are missing

177
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Some of them damn hole that you can see their legs underneath and they're all just fine they just have

178
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
I'm all these kind of crazy

179
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,575
What would seem to be fatal injury is but they're all just kind of walking around like it's no big deal

180
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Just consider it on the species level so it like like yours a creature that has lasted hundreds of Millions

181
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Games of years it outlasted the dinosaurs and the asteroid that killed them it outlasted freezing ocean

182
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
And it's so far has survived the Industrial Age of human

183
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
And you look at in your like

184
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
How

185
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
What's a secret

186
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,943
And it turns out the part of the answer to that

187
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Has to do with that

188
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Baby blue blood

189
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,855
This is Alexis Madrigal again so our blood is red because

190
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Hemoglobin is rich in iron right and their blood is blue because it's rich in Copper so their molecule that carries

191
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Oxygen for them is called

192
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Hemocyanin but would really interesting about this blood is this chemical system

193
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
A slowing down bacteria

194
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,871
So say your horseshoe crab and in your blood there's a little bit of bacteria

195
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Maybe got through the crack in your shell anyway

196
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
In your blood are these

197
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Shout for the me besides he's oval cells that are turn on patrol in the bloodstream and when they

198
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
Counter kind of bacteria the amoebocytes

199
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Oval cells excrete this substance called coagulation which does exactly what it sounds like

200
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Area around where the intruders are just like

201
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Turns into this like jelly stuff that bacteria that snuck in

202
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Trapped in a bowl of Jell-O

203
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Wow

204
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
And a crack in the shell

205
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Amoebocytes

206
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Till that off too

207
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
What does it do with a gel that is a poop it out or something

208
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
Then at dinner can actually attack the cells once they've been slow down

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
So it it blobs The Invader and then that's it and then some other

210
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
Defense Defenders coming in and take it out take it out

211
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Superpower fighting its tiny battles in the bodies of you rather plain-looking creatures

212
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
Touch one of these guys before

213
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,087
First time how does it feel is the reason why people from pharmaceutical companies were on the beach that day

214
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Lithia whole life then you have no idea

215
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
Playing out for literally millions of years

216
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,143
One day humans started to catch on to this

217
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
End

218
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
One human in particular.

219
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,455
To explain we're going to leave the horseshoe crab just for a minute and talk a little bit about

220
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Injectable drugs

221
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
That scientist innovator James Cooper

222
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Any relation to James Fenimore Cooper of like the last of Mohicans

223
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
He was named after James Fenimore Cooper and his son is also named James Fenimore Cooper

224
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
This James Fenimore Cooper told us that while it was

225
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Total Miracle when injectable drugs like

226
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Morphine came onto the scene

227
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
It was also

228
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
A bit of a night

229
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Mare because they didn't know about bacteria

230
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
Occasionally the fluids they were injecting would become contaminated or so does that inject this materials that patients

231
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,879
Get infections and develop terrible fevers or even die

232
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
They can be incredibly dangerous to us and so to make sure these drugs were free of bacteria that cause fevers

233
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
They didn't just you know try it on a person and see if they died

234
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
They checked it

235
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Autorabit

236
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
And they would have liked

237
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Like racks and racks of rabbits

238
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Like 24 rabbits in Iraq

239
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:39,967
They are restrained even that Loosely mean like a pilgrim being punished in the Town Square exactly right

240
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,111
Take a little sample of the thing they wanted to inject into a person and then they would inject that into the rabbit

241
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Ear

242
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
And if there's certain kinds of bacteria present

243
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
The rabbits will get a fever

244
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
The temperature will go up and the way they measure their temperature was with these the electric thermometer

245
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Letters up their bum

246
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,543
So if the rabbits temperature goes up we know we shouldn't put this drug inside a person

247
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
But if there's no temperature Spike

248
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
This solution is safe to inject into man or woman or children or really anyone so that's how crude it was

249
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Cast wasn't

250
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Really that reliable either because rabbits are like pretty sensitive so even if sometimes don't like seeing new person and will gets

251
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Scared then they'll just have a fever because of that

252
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,631
So is really it was not a great test not great for us

253
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Especially not great for the Rapids

254
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,543
After they would go through a few Testament even after only one

255
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Aegis

256
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
They killed them

257
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Enter rabbit Hall of Famer

258
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,575
James Fenimore Cooper my joke is that I love to talk to rabbits because they're all ears

259
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
Any way back in the late 60s

260
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
Cooper was a grad student at Johns Hopkins University

261
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
The end one day one of his professors came up to him in the in the hall or whatever kind of jokingly maybe someone seriously

262
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Is Cooper if you want to get out of this

263
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Institution with your degree

264
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,031
You're going to need to find a way to test for pyrogens

265
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
By something other than the rabbit basically

266
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,687
Find a better way that was sort of a joke although I think he meant some of it

267
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,807
Lucky for Cooper around the same time this other Professor does University dr. Levin

268
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,159
I just come out with a paper on horseshoe crab blood could theoretically

269
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
He used to test for bacteria in

270
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
People

271
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
Hearing doctor 11% about it doctor Cooper sat back in his chair and was like

272
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,495
What does second what if we use the horseshoe crab blood

273
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
To test our drug

274
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Would it be possible to enter take this test and adapted to test drug price

275
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
All of those Rapids

276
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
So they got together made the test work

277
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,439
And as soon as we made that publication in 71

278
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,535
In the pharmaceutical industry jumped right on it and so this

279
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Particular

280
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,447
Chemical substances coagula gin in the horseshoe crab blood actually became

281
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
A major part

282
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Of the way that we test

283
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Things that we're going to inject into our body

284
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
And every hospital as you walk down the

285
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
The Carter you look in a room that's an IV bag hanging surgical instruments on a tray injectables

286
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
For pain

287
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:29,439
Infections your dad pacemaker cancer chemotherapy your grandma's new hit your kids

288
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
EpiPen immunization shots

289
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
All of these things have been tested with this

290
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,799
Material that this tactic were able to do using the time of gold that we

291
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Extract from horseshoe crabs

292
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,967
450 million year old speech

293
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Yeah but in order to

294
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
To do all of that in order to actually you know

295
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Keep our medicine safe

296
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,815
They actually have to go out every year and

297
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
And drain horseshoe crab blood seriously

298
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,215
Best keep doing this out every year

299
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
Crabs every year they drain their blood and then they go put them back out into the ocean like a like a

300
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Like a like a horseshoe crab blood drive

301
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
The whole bunch of companies that do this industry is worth

302
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
Tens of millions of dollars

303
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
I really really wanted to see this all in action but I wanted to go to one of these

304
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Facilities

305
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
After the break a lot of in a very special guest

306
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
Will do just that

307
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
They will infiltrate

308
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
So to speak

309
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
One of these leading facilities and Witness

310
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
The baby blue blood drive

311
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
First hand

312
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
That's coming up

313
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
This is Katie from Big Sky Montana

314
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Radiolab

315
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

316
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,951
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

317

More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

318
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,935
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

319
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,055
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

320
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

321
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

322
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Williams

323
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Basically I want to hear about this

324
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
I kid you know did something

325
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,743
It just means you lean back and say whoa

326
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
How do they do that

327
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

328
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Back to you

329
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

330
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry

331
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
We're interested in the

332
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Specific moments where

333
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,855
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

334
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
If you have a story

335
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Go to radiolab.org

336
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Flash brilliance

337
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Record a short audio message

338
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
And that's where you're at. Org / brilliance

339
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Thank you so much

340
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Is Radiolab we're back

341
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
With lots of Nasser reporting on

342
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Horseshoe crabs

343
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
The scientist who love them or at least love there

344
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Very valuable blood

345
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Maybe them too but mostly black

346
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
And therein lies the rub

347
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:49,375
I think four or five companies that go outside horseshoe crabs and then

348
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Extract their blood

349
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
And wanted to see what what is it look like

350
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
So I sent out a few emails

351
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,407
And then I was emailing these companies for like 3 years the nobody ever return my emails

352
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
I don't know why maybe they didn't want

353
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
Bad press or I don't need anyone bleeding that year or whatever

354
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
And so I basically given up on the story

355
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Begin this year

356
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
These folks at one of the company's culture

357
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,303
Charles River Laboratories ever like hey why don't you just come down to Charleston South Carolina

358
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
And watch what we do here

359
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143

And Ellen and she is a co-creator of NPR's invisibilia

367
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
How did you get in on this

368
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,935
I weirdly have had affection for these creatures my whole life I like grew up with them there's some of my first memories would do

369
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,775
Do you remember seeing I remember seeing what I thought was a crab I was like

370
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Probably

371
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,175
Three or four on the beach with my parents in Cape Cod where we've gone my whole life and

372
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
And I just remember walking on the beach

373
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
And seeing this like massive crab

374
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
In Hawaii third of the size of my body basically

375
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
And remember kind of jumping back and my dad's angle

376
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,792
Pick it up poke at it you know interact and so I kind of turned it over and I saw this

377
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
The closet I got scared

378
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,144

379
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936

00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Explain what a mole was that there had been a crab in there

381
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Laid out and now was the

382
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
This perfectly intact

383
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Skin of what it used to be

384
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
And

385
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
Your Wonder like where is it now and what's it doing now and do I ever leave a self Baha'i don't know is just little and I thought it was

Are we go

391
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,888
Ever since then it's just been a like mild poetic fascination

392
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
To build buildings

393
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,104
Alulu did you have a feeling about this business of any sort before you and visited that there's a part of me that would that

Wondered like oh I totally love these creatures this Big Bad Company Justin

395
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
Splitting it for their blood

396

You know I went with a little

397
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Skepticism

No but then when you go on the inside of your hit with this like I can smell it a wash of a smell of

403
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Crab

Panda

409
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Crab myth

410
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
It's a high-ceiling brightly-lit room with

411
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,928
Industrial sinks along one wall shiny metal operating trays on wheels

412
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,584
Sent no matter where we were standing we just sort of managed to beat like exactly

413
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,960
Do you need us out of the way in the way of all these busy people rushing around

414
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
Lab coats to wear a hairnet

415
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,640
Pushing around these big gray bins on Wheels I'm inside each bin

416
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
AR

417
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
The horseshoe crabs

418
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Twisting and turning a little

419
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:23,904
Waving their tails all heat on top of each other about 20 per bin

420
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
So

421
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
We have are crabs coming in from

422
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,888
That's Brad parashar guide there two parts to the blood donation

423
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
We start by washing the animals scrub the shell

424
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
What you speak are living animals

425
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,968
Smooth shells are passed person-to-person rinsed and Shining

426
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272

Monster wash

430
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
The rack of lamb

431
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
It's time for the bleeding

432
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
16 crabs

433
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Will Dover

434
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,424
Crabs are taken out of their Benz folded in half that their tails are kind of underneath a new put on these racks

435
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Wither strap down with a bungee cord to hold them in place

436
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
And then there were wheeled into this tent

437
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Which is like a

438
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Clean room Zone

439
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Dislike

440
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,760
I got these sort of like plastic curtains all around

441
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Are we can't go in okay and he didn't let us go in there because as regular bacteria carrying humans

442
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,304
You dirty enter the super super clean right in when we did we saw that

443
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
In a crab's body right at that hinge there's like a little opening and the needle goes in there

444
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,800
Any news from that needle that is blood like

445
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Brazilian

446
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
Yeah kind of sci-fi

447
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Sky blue

448
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,016
Blackwood slowly dripping into the glass bottle

449
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
Are low clouds are going but they just kind of look

450
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,160
Like they're sitting there and they're draining them about a third of their blood

451
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
What is your emotional sense of this scene

452
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
You like it was

453
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Kind of this

454
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Feeling some sort of like what we're doing here is

455
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Weird

456
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
And

457
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Kind of

458
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Vampire

459
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640
I don't believe it's like we're sucking their blood

460
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
So

461
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
It was a little creepy

462
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
When

463
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
So lots of flakes

464
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,184
I feel like when we were in there

465
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
There's like

466
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,840
So many we were in the factory dozens and dozens of boxes filled each would like

467
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
10 huge crabs

468
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
And we

469
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
We are in the yeah I not processing Zone

470
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
And before we went and saw the blood

471
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
This like maybe sound cheesy but it was actually

472
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Found Anna keep thinking about it

473
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,712
This there was this moment okay so here we okay what are we looking

474
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
Can I tell when one of the guys in the factory

475
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
I pulled out from these dentist

476
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Big female horseshoe crab

477
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Oh yeah

478
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Baidu

479
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
And he's just sort of holding her by the shell

480
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
The tail is really coming right at me here

481
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,216
Her claws are going up and or tails kind of

482
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Waving around

483
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
Writes a lot of hair

484
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
Exactly and so take these calls

485
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
And he like

486
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
Turn her over so she's upside down

487
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,736
And then he took his hand and just let her go

488
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
I was kind of grabbed his hand

489
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
They're sort of pinching my hands here but

490
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,208
It doesn't hurt that much power to him they're just using that the store to grab the food

491
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Can I try

492
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
Can I get a little pain

493
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
And so I just

494
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Kind of slowly

495
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
Stuck my hand out toward her claws

496
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Are clouds like

497
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Engulfed my hand

498
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Fairy

499
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
Classy

500
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,712
It wasn't a Scrabble you kind of like

501
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Foreign

502
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,088
Attach the all the claws class

503
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
In unison

504
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Really tight

505
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
It's actually kind of

506
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
I thought I am being like this horseshoe crab is

507
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Holding my hand

508
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,288
Timmy and of course this is just silly projecting so I'm saying that

509
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
But like it felt like

510
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
And it wasn't

511
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
But it felt like a communication like I'm in this

512
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Enemies

513
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:37,344
People are doing weird things that I want to be back in the city and I'm upside down and I'm about to go into like

514
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
What have a think you know one of those like shower heads

515
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,512
Braids all up in my undersides and then off to be bungee cord and

516
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Green like

517
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
It was almost it wasn't like it was in pain but I had this almost like

518
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Primal creature to creature

519
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
Help me

520
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Yeah like I mean

521
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
Part of me felt that too

522
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
But

523
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Me on the other hand

524
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Did you get to go home

525
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
So the same fisherman

526
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
That bring the craps to us

527
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Deliver them back to the

528
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
And released their set free

529
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Straight back to the wall

530
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,048
And how many crabs did they do this to every year

531
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
About 500 thousand

532
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Horseshoe crabs every year

533
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Do the crabs to get blood and then released him and didn't they just swim away fine or some of them

534
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:33,664
After the bleeding there's a small percentage like I think

535
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
The conservative estimates around like 10%

536
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
But that might be a higher estimate or

537
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,112
Am I get lost

538
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:48,000
15% like 15% so if you're talkin about 500,000

539
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Crabs

540
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
Divide every year that that that means about

541
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
75000

542
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
Horseshoe crabs are dying because of bleeding every year

543
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
You know they actually is in that original paper that I looked at again Alexis Madrigal they were actually

544
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
See that a lot of the the crabs don't have

545
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Like

546
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
Blood crabs and non-blood crabs like have slightly different movement patterns and that's because you know maybe one of them is

547
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Missing 30% of its blood

548
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
But I needed to

549
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
I needed to double-check on that until they did

550
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
See that the blood animals

551
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Appear more lethargic they move

552
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
You know

553
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Marsala

554
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,728
And like imagine if imagine if you had to go like Harvest deer

555
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
And then believe them of 30% of their blood and then you'd like leave them back out in the forest like there's something about that hands so yeah

556
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
It seems very medieval

557
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Is there any hope

558
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,272
I'm getting out of this whole vampire relationship we have with the horseshoe crabs

559
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Well

560
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Perhaps

561
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,648
And let me tell you a brief story

562
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
About a bird

563
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Smallest bird

564
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Cinnamon in color

565
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,048
With a long bill it's called a redneck

566
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,168
Incredible thing about red knots is of all the birds in the world

567
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
The Red Knot makes one of the longest migration

568
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
Nearly 10000 miles

569
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,848
Tickle from the very southern tip of South America

570
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
All the way up to northern northern

571
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
Handed up into the Arctic Circle where they lay their eggs

572
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
And the whole journey

573
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
Takes about 5 months

574
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:22,208
And what happens is thousands of these red. Birds will take off from South America to fly like 4000 miles

575
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,816
Brazil stopped at 4 just like a couple days rest up eat some food

576
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
And then the thousands of them take the skies again and they fly top along the eastern coast of South America over

577
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,616
The Atlantic Ocean before they get to their final messing grounds they make one more stop one pivotal

578
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Russo rest stop

579
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
In

580
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,272
The Delaware Bay

581
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Yeah

582
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Dried up

583
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,184
Now when I was in Delaware there weren't like a

584
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,048
Kind of birds that are but basically these birds when they make this journey they rely on horse

585
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Because

586
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
I don't know if you've noticed

587
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Missing all the eggs

588
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
They need to eat millions of horseshoe crab eggs to complete their migration

589
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,944
And this is the thing it's weirdly these birds

590
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
That might actually free the horseshoe crabs

591
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
From us

592
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Yeah yep

593
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,160
And to explain I got in touch with this guy my name is j Bolden a biology

594
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,488
In the global quality Laboratories at Eli Lilly and Company

595
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
So Eli Lilly and Company

596
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Huge pharmaceutical company that makes

597
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
You know cancer drugs

598
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Antidepressants

599
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
A lot of insulin and things like that and real quick people

600
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,032
Are at the core of our commitment Manufacturing

601
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,360
Here's a message from executive the driving force behind our innovation

602
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Radiolab is brought to you by

603
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Anyway

604
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:54,112
One of the things that companies been helping innovate is horseshoe crab blood a synthetic version of horseshoe crab blood

605
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
Yeah so you know G

606
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
The problem is there needs to be a supply of horseshoe crab

607
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
You know climate change is real

608
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,896
I could have some supply chain consequences which isn't good

609
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,480
And it was actually all the way back in 1997

610
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Some researchers

611
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,064
Out of the University of Singapore cloned

612
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
Just factor C protein

613
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,696
The essential Factor see protein in horseshoe crab blood that goes

614
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Blue blue blue blue

615
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,584
Around the bad bacteria and now we can make

616
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
The protein of Interest

617
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Instead of getting it directly from horseshoe crabs

618
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
So why are we already using that

619
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:49,152
Will Jay explain that there's a whole bunch of different reasons but one of the big ones was that you already had an industry

620
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,760
Tri built on horseshoe crab blood and so there is no real immediate incentive

621
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
To change

622
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Which is actually

623
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
How we get back to

624
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
The cumin curcumin good friends

625
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
The Buzz

626
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:07,584
So turns out people like these birds a lot like actually way more than horseshoe crab

627
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
But

628
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,752
Since the birds eat the horseshoe crab eggs their feet is kind of entwined so like the horseshoe crab is not doing

629
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:21,152
Well then the birds not going to do well and so why don't I just go around to all the birds

630
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
Conservationists to use some of their political power and contacts and it's only now that we're starting to come up

631
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
Pain

632
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
A new dawn

633
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
Good afternoon everyone and welcome here is a great place to be today

634
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,008
2018 J was standing on a stage along with some conservationists

635
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:52,384
Do Nancy Eli Lilly would be one of the first companies to use synthetic horseshoe crab

636
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,432
The big headline news here

637
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Is it the pharmaceutical industry can actually

638
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
Replace probably up to 90%

639
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:05,184
Abusive horseshoe crab blood without incurring any major regulatory change

640
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
Which means these horseshoe crabs can finally be freed of their servitude and bondage to mankind

641
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
Can get back to doing

642
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
What is going on

643
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
What they love

644
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Well

645
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,600
But here's the weird thing and I think like

646
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
If the synthetic comes through and we get it perfect and it works and we never have to drain another horseshoe crab then they just because

647
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,816
Come these weird kind of sea spiders again

648
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
And I

649
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
I could be

650
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
A really bad thing for them

651
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Yeah

652
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
Exactly this is actually something that Alexis Madrigal talks about 2 because most of the other things that these horseshoe crabs have

653
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:59,968
Ever been used for in the history of their encounter with humans as resulted in the death of like large numbers of them

654
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Because before we ever valued them for their blood thing one we turn them into a breathalyzer

655
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
Ketchum boil them and grind them and then just stick them in the soil as a way of

656
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Promoting plant growth

657
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
Or Thing 2

658
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
We catch him

659
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
Cut them up and use them to like as bait

660
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,240
To catch more valuable species like a particular kind of snails

661
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:27,616
Okay so I have right here in front of me this comes from the Atlantic states marine fisheries Commission

662
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
Which their number save that you know

663
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
As of the late 90s

664
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:37,088
There were nearly 3 million horseshoe crabs being killed every year for commercial fishing

665
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
3 million wow

666
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,232
But more recently we put restrictions on how many horseshoe crabs can be used for commercial fishing for bait

667
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,048
It's even like him a lot of seats at

668
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
Slime to go to a beach and just take a

669
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
You know a bunch of horseshoe crabs like in New Jersey if you take a horseshoe crab you could get fined

670
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
$1,000

671
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,360
The thing that I've always wanted to keep in mind of this is like

672
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,760
If you're going to have to be in a hook up to some economic system which most animals in our world are

673
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:10,112
You kind of want to be hooked up to one that that's super high value

674
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
And that doesn't kill you

675
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
Is it a fear is if like if the synthetic works and we no longer need horseshoe crabs for their Precious Blood then we just go back

676
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
Back to chopping them up putting them in the ground and using them for bait because they live where we live they live along

677
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Populist

678
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Sure

679
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
And

680
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
That right there for the taking

681
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
You know they're not

682
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Prepared for our murderer simple

683
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Unlock this

684
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Nice to meet you

685
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
Thanks for having us here

686
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Glad to

687
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,904
And there was this moment where everything just kind of

688
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Lyft for me

689
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
You know like where I realized that

690
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,792
As cruel and kind of grizzly as the

691
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
Draining of the blood

692
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Themes

693
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
I actually may be the best

694
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Thing for these creatures

695
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Like our

696
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Selfishness

697
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,592
Maybe protecting them

698
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,040
This is our very last stop on our trip down to South Carolina and we met this fisherman named Jerry Galt

699
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
Who is employed to collect

700
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
Horseshoe crabs for the company

701
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
What peaceful little

702
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Swear in this Forest

703
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Yeah I know this

704
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
This feels like the most secluded place

705
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,584
With Jerry walking around this little pond

706
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
I worthy exactly wrong.

707
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:31,520
What's known as the holding Pond where they put the crabs before they go off to the facility

708
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
And while we were down there. There

709
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Jerry likes

710
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
Poop some water out of the pond

711
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
Best bottled water

712
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
Then he held the bottle up to our faces

713
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
In the movie

714
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
All of them

715
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
Every

716
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Wow there's so many of them

717
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
How many yeah they do

718
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
100000 eggs

719
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
How to season

720
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Wow

721
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,960
The size of a like a really round grain of rice

722
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Pearled couscous

723
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
Are they were they laying the eggs

724
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,664
Here or or or did you

725
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
Where you lay their eggs Longshore

726
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Disbelief

727
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Yeah I'll literally right here

728
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Oh wow

729
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,024
I feel like we heard a tiny bit about but what's the what's the story of

730
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
How you went

731
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
From where your family went from

732
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Being

733
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
Kind of seafood

734
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Being a fisherman too

735
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
To doing this kind of

736
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Crazy different

737
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Well

738
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,592
We're just a bunch of Fishman of ADD

739
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
A cherry told us

740
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,528
The gist of it is back when his dad was doing Seafood fishing

741
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
70

742
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
His dad was catching a lot of horseshoe crab selling them off for bait and then one day this guy just showed up at his house Suit and Tie

743
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
Dad did if you would quit selling them for bait

744
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,048
You know you make a deal for me you would buy them

745
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Buying for more money

746
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
To Jerry's dad said

747
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
We've been doing it ever since

748
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
But I got something I want you guys to know as a fisherman

749
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
I'm proud to be part of it that's fine it'll be

750
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
I want to say is the most

751
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Noble thing I do

752
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,992
Because I get to touch every one of you guys because it's used for

753
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Making sure medication is

754
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
It's a forest

755
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
And

756
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Can't say that about

757
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Soft shell crabs are

758
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
Agrupar he live

759
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Touch it again

760
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
ITouch

761
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
You

762
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Indirectly

763
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
Indirectly I'm touching all of us here

764
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Because we're all part of it

765
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,288
So it's pretty neat thing

766
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
If you had to describe your

767
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Feelings

768
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
For the crabs

769
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
For the horseshoe crabs

770
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
How do you

771
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Feel about that

772
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Well

773
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
I have a lot of respect for him

774
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
And

775
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
I almost feel like it's some

776
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Divine Design

777
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
Horseshoe crab is

778
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
No

779
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
I've seen him

780
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,936
Fishing Forum you know their new since then

781
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
And Naseem on the side with important to

782
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
Human Society

783
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
In

784
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
I just drives me back the idea that is

785
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
It was

786
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
Divine Design and they been around 400 million years it took him this

787
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
Took us this long to figure it out I guess

788
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
Any curiosity where did that

789
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
Without leave the two of you

790
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,632
For me I mean Jerry's of the fishermen he's

791
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
He's totally right like we we just

792
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Figured this out these crabs are being Clark kenting us

793
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,152
This whole time they they have this hard one superpower that they probably had since

794
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,760
You know before like three branches on our evolutionary tree and

795
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,320
An an in evolutionary terms like

796
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,904
Are the winners words that we're chops

797
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
We're baby Chomp

798
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
And they're just like

799
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
There is

800
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Something

801
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
Miraculous

802
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,120
Inside them and end in a certain way

803
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
It's easy to stand next to them and feel almost small

804
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,568
We're not unlike an asteroid or just another thing they're probably going to

805
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Interlock we are a blip

806
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
To them

807
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
And yet

808
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
We're dangerous live

809
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
An n in a weird way like

810
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,624
People the people we met down here the people doing this

811
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
Work this Blood harvesting work

812
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
In a wake to represent

813
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
The best way to treat the crabs

814
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Exactly treat him like eggs

815
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,752
There are these rules in place to make sure that the horseshoe crabs are only picked up by hand and you can't pick them up by the tail

816
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Cuz you can injure the

817
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
The muscle

818
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,616
Until we keep them covered when we transport them

819
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
They're also on a time clock

820
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,527
We've got to get him back as quick as possible they have to be back to the ocean within 24 hours

821
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
When they get to the lab

822
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:06,207
Give it a manicure pedicure each one gets scrubbed clean by hand

823
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
Bring it back and let it go

824
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,583
And he showed us how he returns them to the water and he like

825
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
He built this freaking

826
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,727
Waterslide to do it more gently

827
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
No now we

828
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Pick him up

829
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Sedimentary slide

830
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
In the water take some time to the river

831
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,639
Before we used to

832
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Pick him up and toss

833
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
And we've got away from tossing them

834
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Is amazing

835
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
I got to slide on my dog 204 Long

836
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Water slide

837
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
Where they rehydrate on their way to the river

838
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
That's the mail

839
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
We just interrupted his

840
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871

There's nothing finer than the feel of Jane suckling algae for my back

893
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
If that sounds gross

894
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,839

895
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Find horseshoe crab like Jane

896
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Climbing up onto your shell

Nibbling and scraping around to remove this past week

904
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
Sorry I must have brought this is a pregnancy curse but there might be some breaths you're going to take out I'm so tired even

905
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Denigrate

906
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
What fees should say when her work was complete my turn

907
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,887
And I'd climb back up onto her back

908
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Two around a bit

909
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
Pop a few Barnacles off but

910
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,519
I never really did that great of a job

911
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
For two reasons

912
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
1

913
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
I am a bit late

914
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
2

915
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:46,527
After years of being a bit lazy and allowing my Jane's shell to becoming crested and salt scabs algae barnacle

916
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
More than a few muscles

917
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111
I've come to find it all quite

918
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,463
The whole stinking mess is a topographical record of our

919
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,583
When I say this to Jane she rolls all 9 of her eyes but I mean it

920
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,167
That patch of black algae on harappa Malik Ridge

921
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,007
That appear the night last spring when we spawned under a new moon

922
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Which is of course

923
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
No moon at all

924
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
That white gunk

925
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Near her tail

926
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
From a nap in the mud

927
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,223
The actual remnant of a cuddle

928
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Or those Barnacles on her backside

929
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
I know the very day they latched on

930
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
It was on a trip up to Maine to see the tide pools

931
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:30,559
Jenna been scared of going scared of black bears or humans are yada yada yada I cut in and told her those were just miss

932
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,655
Perpetuated by fearful crabs with too much goddamn time on their hands

933
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:40,287
Life Is For Living I told her as I thrust her into the Gulf Stream and boy what a time we had

934
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
We soaked in tidepools we lay out in the sun Jane picking away at my back while I walked her through my idea for a star

935
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Schnabel

936
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,039
The particles must have suction onto her somewhere between the

937
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,087
Boyhood stargazing scene

938
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,647
Spooky starfish star residence

939
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
And the seagull attack scene

940
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
Even if I hadn't been too exhausted from My Fit of inspiration to work on her Barnacles at night I doubt I would have been able to pry them

941
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
I'm off

942
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,959
As they prove the next morning hunter that glaring Mane son

943
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
There are as hard as

944
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Oh well

945
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
Without these spots I fear I'd forget

946
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
The life will become a wash

947
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,015
I whisper these kinds of things to Jane when she seems a shame of her little green beard

948
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Or when she sluggish from her kelp

949
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
Tails pulling in the tide

950
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
These stains and scabs are the

951
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Circulars of Arc

952
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
Experience I tell her

953
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
There are memories

954
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
Need physical

955
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,631
A record forged in desiccating sichting

956
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
I mean

957
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,567
It's not that I don't appreciate a smoother shell when I see one

958
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
Jefferson

959
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Wife

960
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
For example it is hard not to notice her swimming by

961
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
Rochelle turgid with the strain

962
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
Perfection

963
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,367
And if you happen to be on Shore when she comes up for air

964
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Watch out

965
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,743
It is almost like an optical illusion water on water

966
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,047
Pump of liquid emerging from it

967
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Self

968
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,655
What I'd give to reach out with the tiny hairs in my most

969
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:15,775
Private of spots my nephew basis and run them along her shell

970
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
But still

971
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
You couldn't pay me to trade places with Jeff

972
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,527
Well I'm off on a fish carcass Bender with the guys are having a quiet morning to myself going mollusk hunting

973
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,599
Jefferson is at home in that same damn ditch

974
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Tending to his wife

975
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
All day long

976
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
Pics and Buffs

977
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,791
Scrapes and scrubs washing away her every residue

978
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
She won't even tolerate a bit of salt buildup

979
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
It was a simpler existence

980
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,447
It's with my Jane

981
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
My Old Barnacle gal

982
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
More free

983
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Lately though

984
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
I have to admit I've been feeling restless

985
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
We're not fighting at all

986
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,247
We're still very much able to make each other laugh

987
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
But

988
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
I feel so big

989
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
Things within me are becoming uneasy

990
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,463
I mentioned something along the lines of this to Jane about a week ago

991
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
But she assured me it was nothing

992
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Just physical

993
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Time to molt

994
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,375
But the moon proved her wrong

995
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,775
The brightening Moon and The Descent of thousands of new horseshoe crabs on the Cove it's the spawn of

996
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,383
Horse the upcoming spawn must be was triggering this uneasiness in my gut

997
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,199
Because while the first part is lovely

998
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:33,599
There is nothing like the feel of your pedipalp out in the ocean holding onto the edge of Jane's shell with your grippers

999
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:38,719
10000 other crabs clacking so hard around you it's sometimes induces a c Steam

1000
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,279
What happens afterwards is

1001
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Unsettling

1002
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
Something strange comes over everybody

1003
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,239
Jefferson is no longer high-strung Jefferson

1004
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,567
His wife no longer a prima donna Frank

1005
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,871
He's always been kind of weird and lonely

1006
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Themes

1007
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Okay

1008
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,991
Everybody is lifted from their selves

1009
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,575
Or rather ourselves seem to lift from our bodies and leave us

1010
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
We become one

1011
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
Without our peculiarities at Giant

1012
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,743
10000 Claude being

1013
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
As we fall asleep at night

1014
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,375
Thousands of us thinking into the cool mud all at once

1015
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
Kind of communal dream takes place

1016
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
And we awake United

1017
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
We share food

1018
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,799
Take turns guarding the eggs

1019
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
Drop our suspicions of one another

1020
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,431
We are an efficient machine of a species

1021
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,735
Without the drag of the individual

1022
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
I think there could be a book in this

1023
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
A sort of anti hardening in fetus

1024
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
Promise of the commons

1025
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
Imagine a completely selfless species what good we could do how quickly we could rise

1026
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
But

1027
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Alas

1028
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,959
Curse of us creatures unable to change a thing about ourselves since the dinosaurs

1029
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
We can never get this elevated

1030
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,823
State to last any longer than a couple of weeks

1031
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,151
It ends instantaneously with the hatch

1032
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,223
Once we've watched as Tiny versions of us

1033
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,783
Smaller than clams with little button tails

1034
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
Disappear into the surf

1035
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,647
The collective conscious being acidic a

1036
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:18,303
Ourselves float back down into our shells and we feel that familiar itch again of loneliness

1037
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
A selfie

1038
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Confined irrevocably

1039
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
To its own body

1040
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,239
That's when we become assholes again and dick heads

1041
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
And self-serious know-it-alls

1042
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
And so my hunch

1043
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,639
I tell Jane is that this strange

1044
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Gurgling in my gut

1045
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
It's some kind of

1046
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
Quantum vertigo

1047
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Yeah that's it

1048
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:45,439
Quantum vertigo myself longing to be set free Into The Ether where it can

1049
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,535
Leap and spin and do whatever it is self do up there

1050
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
And dastardly old me

1051
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
This collection of hard shell and claws

1052
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Desperate

1053
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
To keep it inside

1054
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
But no

1055
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Jane was right

1056
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
It was just time to molt

1057
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
Ha she said after she heard The Telltale

1058
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
Rumble from underneath my presuma

1059
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,295
Poor old grabs thinking he's the next

1060
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
Political theorist

1061
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
Stirring with ideas

1062
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
When really it was just a case of

1063
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Skeletal indigestion

1064
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
I went there with my tail

1065
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Shut up

1066
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
She was about to respond

1067
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:25,119
Eric Lottery burp came out instead

1068
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
I said

1069
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
Mutual

1070
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
Mutual molting

1071
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Genocide

1072
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
Splendid

1073
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,823
As we ready ourselves for the process

1074
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,639
There's not much you can do but stand there and take it

1075
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
I realized something

1076
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:45,087
What timing I said to Jane will have fresh bodies just in time for the spawn pristine

1077
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Shell

1078
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,671
I thought you liked my in crustaceans

1079
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Said Jane

1080
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,231
Staring out at the sea

1081
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,279
I do I got

1082
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
My darling of course I do

1083
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
It was right around then that she started to split

1084
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,983
Her head started craning forward and iWatch

1085
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,799
Nauseated and thrilled as a bigger

1086
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,615
Wetter version of her began sliding out

1087
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
It took hours

1088
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,247
This arduous process of slipping out of yourself

1089
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,087
But when she finally emerged she was a sight to behold

1090
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
Like Jane

1091
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,927
But gleaming and massive

1092
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
I better go she said

1093
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
I know I whispered

1094
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:31,167
The soft and jelly like new Jane would need to find a secluded place to hide as her cell hardened

1095
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
Shall I find you in our spot

1096
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
Sure she said

1097
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
I began to slowly

1098
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
Carefully

1099
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
Step away

1100
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,175
I lay down next to her old body in the sand

1101
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,247
It was almost like laying with her any old day

1102
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
That trustee Silence of her listening

1103
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,135
But with her shell completely empty now

1104
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,695
That familiar pattern of barnacles

1105
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,487
Took on a frightening weight

1106
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,327
Something about them made me feel very worried

1107
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
They can tell you what

1108
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,703
Eventually I too found myself splitting

1109
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
It wasn't the easiest of mold so I'll spare you the Gory details but let's just say the old me didn't want to let the new me through

1110
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,687
And it made its reluctance known with a deep gash down my back

1111
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
But at last I emerged

1112
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
Bloodied and gelatinous

1113
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
I went to some bushes nearby

1114
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,159
There I waited as my back began to harden

1115
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,511
Through the brambles I had a good view of our old shells

1116
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
Lying side-by-side in the sand

1117
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,631
Two little humps in front of the sea

1118
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,935
I gave that ass for hours

1119
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
Is the moon split across

1120
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
The sky

1121
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
There was me

1122
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
The old me

1123
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,663
A shiny little Dome reflecting the moon's journey in miniature

1124
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
There was Jane

1125
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
The old Jane

1126
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
A body so carpeted and weeds and Stone

1127
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,087
That she reflected

1128
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Only us

1129
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
A week into legs

1130
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Human ones

1131
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
Switching by my brambles

1132
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
The rubber pads on it

1133
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
Feet make horrible squeaking noises

1134
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
I Get Low

1135
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,775
Blackhawk for a moment and then run over to the old Jane in the old me

1136
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,151
The creature a little one for human Yanks old me by the tail and brings me up

1137
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
Tithead

1138
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
IWatch is it said he's my private Underside

1139
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,807
Then turns me over and places me back down

1140
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,111
Thank God right where I have been in the sand

1141
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,951
It runs its strange hand along my smooth shell

1142
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,511
It turns to examine old Jane

1143
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Her sweet fuzz

1144
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
Are barnacles

1145
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Ilife

1146
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
Rochelle cracks

1147
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
Under the rubber pad of its

1148
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
Butt crack

1149
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Into a thousand pieces

1150
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,823
Little bastard heirs to pick old me up again

1151
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,663
And all I can do is watch for my brambles as it runs away with me

1152
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,967
And it runs away with my past self

1153
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
Dragging it ruthlessly

1154
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Down the shore

1155
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
The spawn has come and gone

1156
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
I looked everywhere for Jane

1157
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,255
Waiting by our spot calling her name into the clacking shells

1158
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Nothing

1159
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Now

1160
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
I spend most evenings underwater with

1161
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
Frank

1162
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Weird Frank

1163
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
Awaiting her return

1164
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,055
The fish won't stop nibbling at my molting wound

1165
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,127
I can feel flat worms burrowing into my back

1166
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,503
Ask Frank to help me clean it but he spits muscles and tells me I've got to be kidding

1167
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
Michelle is growing itchy with Grit

1168
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,647
I don't know if it's and or Barnacles are what

1169
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
This afternoon

1170
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,327
I simply stood before the undertow and called her name into its haunting screams

1171
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,631
Jane

1172
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,983
Jane

1173
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,567
Tells me to shut up about my starfish novel

1174
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:54,431
Everyone does a coming-of-age starfish novel he says I mean write the damn thing if you want

1175
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,479
Please stop talking about it

1176
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
As I sit with him

1177
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,831
Algae sprouting on my lip

1178
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,135
I rethink the value of a self

1179
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,511
Screw the promise of the collective I think sometimes oneself can be a pretty good thing

1180
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,815
Self like a Jane

1181
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
For instance

1182
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,167
I keep getting hit with shards of grid that

1183
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,751
Instead of bouncing off my shell now get caught in my kelp

1184
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
Tangles

1185
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
I feel sluggish

1186
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
Unwieldy

1187
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
In constant pain

1188
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
I think I'm past selves

1189
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,479
That smooth old me

1190
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
What is a self anyway

1191
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
What endures

1192
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,671
With the solo thing of question and my body now long gone

1193
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,463
Is it even continuous

1194
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
I have the distinct

1195
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Sense

1196
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,607
The Jane would tell me this is magical thinking

1197
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,959
That the old me is off somewhere on the mainland near that little human creature

1198
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,823
I can picture that clean old Shell of mine drying out near some flower pots

1199
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,919
Being occasionally sniffed out by an idiotic canine with a sloppy tongue

1200
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Yes I'm sure of it

1201
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:05,599
They're Jane with scrunch up all 9 of her eyes and say of course you're sure of it you're making it up

1202
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,951
The old me is preserved in pristine form on the mainland

1203
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,535
Well the smashed shards of my sweet old Jane

1204
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,351
Encrusted in the very stuff of our love

1205
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Disintegrate into the sea

1206
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
Perhaps it's little bits of her

1207
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
That are sticking to me now

1208
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
Where's my horseshoe crabs

1209
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,991
Oh that's great

1210
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
That's really nice

1211
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
You're really nice to listen to while I know

1212
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,927
Good I'm glad that's lovely

1213
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
I I didn't

1214
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Heading home
