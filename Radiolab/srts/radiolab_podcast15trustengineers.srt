1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,792
Are you awake

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,728
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,592
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,896
And NPR

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
All right hey I'm Jared I'm Rod I Robert krulwich this is Radiolab the podcast here's a story we've been following

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
Comes from a friend of mine Andrews Ali

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
2 is

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,512
Is a great thinker and writer you would a book called resilience why things bounce back

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,352
And it's a lot about technology

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Yeah but it's been a long time

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
For a long time in the relationship

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Tween

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Technology

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
And emotion

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
In

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Because

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,944
Well I've thrown more than one cell phone

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,992
Into the ground

19
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
And whenever having breakfast one day and he pitched me on this idea of doing the story

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
About Facebook

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
Remember iron on a huge

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,488
No believer in doing stories about Facebook

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Mystery

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Wickedly interesting

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Profound in its way

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
So he and I've been falling for a couple years

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
And down to this roller coaster

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
Events it really begins in 2011

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Will let me back up for me

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
One of the challenges talking about Facebook

31
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
What is just

32
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
The scale

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Of the thing

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
So you know there's there's

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
1.3 billion people on Earth as of March 2014

36
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Active monthly users there's a billion people who access the site through through mobile

37
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Devices

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
Just to put that in perspective there's more Facebook users than there are Catholic

39
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
That camera is real

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
Yeah yeah yeah

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
It turns out it

42
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Is true

43
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
But they're neck-and-neck

44
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,968
When you have one out of every seven people on the planet in the same space

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Trying to connect

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Across time and geography you're bound to create problem sometimes

47
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
Again tonight the issue this time

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Before we go there

49
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
We should introduce you to the guy in our story who is the problem solver

50
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
My name is Arturo Vega

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
And I'm a director of engineering at face

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
Story begins Christmas 2011

53
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
People doing what they do every holiday season they're getting back together with their families and they're going to family parties in there taking lots and

54
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
Lots of pictures

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
Inderal uploading them to Facebook and at the time

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,184
The number of photos that were getting uploaded what's going pretty crazy

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
In fact in just a few days between Christmas

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,584
And New Year's there are more images

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Uploaded

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
The Facebook then the word of the entirety of liquid

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
You say more images are uploaded in a week

62
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Two Facebook in all a flicker all time

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Which created a

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
Situation the number of photos what's going on along with a number of photos going up

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
The number for Portsmouth going up

66
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
What do you mean by reports is this

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
Back in 2011 if you saw something on Facebook that really upset you

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
You

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Could click a button

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,632
To report it you can tell Facebook to take it down which from their perspective

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Is it really important

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Mechanism

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
If your Facebook

74
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
You don't want certain kinds of content on your site you don't want nudity you don't want like drug use hate speech things like that

75
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
Fatso a day or so after Christmas thereabouts Facebook Engineers come back to work and they find

76
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Waiting for them

77
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
Literally millions

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Photo reports

79
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
The number of people that would be necessary to review everything I was coming in

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
It kind of boggled

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Mine

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
How many people would you need it

83
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,984
I think at the time we were looking at it for just two years ago and I can all this has grown so much since and we're looking at like thousand

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Sounds like some

85
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Giant facility in Nevada

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
Filled with nothing but humans

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Looking at Christmas board

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
We're actually joking about this but we found out later

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
There actually are thousands of P

90
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Across the world

91
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Who do this for internet

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
All day long

93
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Clearly warrants

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Don't show but for our purposes

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,303
Just know that when a photo is reported a human being has to look at

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
Tattoo right because there needs to be a judgment on the image and humans are the best at that

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
So Archer decided

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Before we do anything

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Let's just figure out what we're dealing with

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
And so we sat down with a team of people

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,687
We started going through the photos of people were reporting

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
What they found was it about 97% of these

103
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Millionaire so photo

104
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Reports

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
We're drastically

106
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Miss calligraphist

107
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,535
They're sitting moms holding little babies reported for harassment

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,631
Pictures of families in matching Christmas sweaters reported for nudity

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Pictures of puppies reported for hate speech

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Puppies reported as hate speech

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Don't like

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
What's going on right

113
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
So they decide to invest

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Okay so step one for Facebook

115
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Ask if you are these people

116
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Why don't you like this photo

117
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Why did you report this

118
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Responses come back and the first thing they realize is

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415
Is it almost always the person complaining about the image

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
Within the image they were complaining about

121
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
And it just hate the picture

122
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
Maybe they were doing a goofy dance someone snapped a photo and that why do you post that

123
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,983
Maybe they were at a party they got a little too drunk that you hooked up with their EX

124
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Somebody took a picture and

125
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,127
That person says of you know that's a one-time thing us never happen again take it down

126
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
Arturo said they were definitely a lot of reports from people who used to be couple

127
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Sending Dave broke up

128
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
And then they're asking to take the photos down

129
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,463
And the puppy what would what would be the reason for that Poppy maybe it's your ex-wife's puppy

130
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
You see it makes

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
She said

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Take it down

133
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
So once we've begun investigating you find that there's a little bit

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
Relationship things that happened that are like really complicated

135
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
You're talking about stuff that's the kind of natural to try to sue

136
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,943
Human dramas

137
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Plicate speech

138
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Because

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
That was one of the only option

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
They were just picking because they needed to get to the next screen to submit the report

141
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
So we added a step

142
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
Archer and his team set it up so that when people were choosing that option

143
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,911
Facebook some of them would see a little box on the screen

144
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
That's sad

145
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
How does the photo make you feel

146
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
In the Box gave several choices the options where

147
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,991
Embarrass embarrassing that name setting bad photo and other

148
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
Where you can write in whatever you want

149
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
About the image

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,927
And it worked incredibly well I mean like 50% of people with select an emotion like

151
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Princess embarrassing

152
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
And then 34% of people would select other

153
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
And

154
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
We read those we sit down and we're waiting the other

155
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm what was the most frequent thing that people were typing in

156
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
To other it was it's embarrassed

157
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
It's embarrassed but you had embarrassing on the list I know

158
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
That's weird I know

159
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Arturo's

160
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Okay

161
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Maybe we should

162
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Just put

163
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
It's

164
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
What are the choices

165
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
As in please describe this piece of content

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
It's embarrassing it's a bad photo of me it makes me sad

167
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
Etc and when they brought out the choices that way

168
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
That extra words we went from 50% of people selecting an emotion to

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
78% people selecting an emotion

170
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
In other words

171
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
The word

172
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
It's

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
All by itself

174
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Boosted the response by

175
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
20

176
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
8%

177
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
From 50 to 78

178
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
In Facebook land that means thousands and thousands of people and we just a sort of what could that be

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
It to people like full sentences

180
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Your stinking

181
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
It's always good to mirror the way people talk

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Arturo's ideas

183
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
Define conditioning is that

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
When you just say embarrass

185
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
There's no subject

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
It's silently implied

187
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Yuan

188
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
But would you say

189
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
It's embarrassing one that shifts the sort of emotional energy to this

190
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Photograph

191
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
And so then it's less hot and it's

192
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Either deal with no interest

193
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,807
That thing is embarrassing I'm fine it's embarrassing

194
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
It is responsible for lost me

195
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Good writer

196
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,023
But it still doesn't solve their basic problem because even if Facebook now knows

197
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Why the person flag

198
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
It was embarrassing and not act

199
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Hate speech

200
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,239
I still can't take it down I mean there's nothing in the policy to terms of service that says

201
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,383
You can't put up embarrassing photos in fact if they took it down if you violating the rights of the person who posted it

202
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Like there's nothing we can do I'm sorry

203
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
Oh so they actually fence themselves in a little bit.

204
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
For me I always put it in

205
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
I would just be like

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Go deal with it your

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,159
Yourself

208
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
Shock to the bird that's the solution

209
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
I he wouldn't put it that way but

210
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
What he needed to have happened

211
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
For the person who posted

212
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
Picture in the person who is pissed about it

213
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
To talk to each other

214
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
To work it out themselves

215
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,871
So are true and his teammate at week where if you said this photo was embarrassing or whatever

216
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
A new screen would pop up

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,991
I would ask if you want the front to take the photo down

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
If you said yes

219
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
I would like my stupid

220
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Boyfriend to take the photo down an empty message box

221
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Just an empty box

222
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,071
It's sad we think it's a good idea for you to tell the person who upset you that they upset you

223
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
Only 20% of people with type something in and send that message

224
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
They just didn't do it they just said

225
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
I'd rather you deal with this

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Sartorius email

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Let's take it one step further

228
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,455
When that message box popped up we gave people that default message that we requested

229
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
2 *

230
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
That conversation

231
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
Just get the conversation going and it's going to be the first version of the message that we did

232
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Was like

233
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
Hey I didn't like this photo take it down

234
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
Hey I don't like that photo that's a little aggressive

235
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
But

236
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
When they started presenting people with a message box

237
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
Senate pre-written in you're almost immediately we went from

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
20% of people sending a message

239
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
To 50% of people sending a message

240
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,871
Really that's surprising expecting to see that pick up a shift

241
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
And so this music people just don't want to write

242
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Dell sign up for pretty much anything

243
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Not necessarily maybe it's just that

244
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
It's so easy

245
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
To shirk the responsibility of

246
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Confronting another person

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
That you need every little stupid nuts YouTube

248
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Have an effect

249
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
So they're like okay

250
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
If that works so well

251
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Why we trust different wording

252
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Instead of

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Hey

254
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
I didn't like this photo

255
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Take it down

256
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Why don't we try hey Robert

257
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
I don't like this photo

258
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Take it down

259
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Just putting in your name

260
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
Works about 7% better than leaving it out

261
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,415
It means that you're 7% more likely either to get the person to do what you ask them to do take out

262
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
Turn photo to start a conversation about how to resolve your feelings

263
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,399
Over now measuring the effectiveness of the message so if I'm objecting will the other party pull

264
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Pull it off the computer for just talked

265
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Okay they also tried variations like a Robert would you please

266
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Take it down

267
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Please or would you mind

268
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,735
Take me to town. Would you please performs 4% better than would you mind

269
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
Not totally sure why but there they tried dozens of phrases like

270
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Would you please would you mind I'm sorry to bring this up

271
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,975
Would you please take it down and start bring this up but would you mind taking it down and at a certain point

272
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,119
Andrew Nygaard true

273
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
We just wanted to see this whole process they're going

274
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Threw up close

275
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,799
So we took a trip out to Facebook headquarters Menlo Park

276
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
California and somebody year ago

277
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,783
Just for the hubbub we met up with Arturo

278
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,903
Let's hang out one of these sort of like a socialist Utopia Silicon Valley campuses were

279
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
People are like in hammocks and their this volleyball happening

280
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Did foxes running around at one point to be there on a Friday because every Friday afternoon

281
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Arturo assembles this really big group

282
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,895
To review all the data

283
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
15 people crammed into a conference room

284
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,295
Technical folks

285
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
Dan Farrell I'm a data scientist

286
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
A lot of these guys called themselves

287
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Trust Engineers that you trust Engineers are joined by a bunch of Outside song

288
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Professor psychology UC Berkeley Mac Killingsworth I studied the causes and nature of

289
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Human happiness emiliana Simon Thomas

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
My background is neuroscience

291
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
This is the meeting where the team is reviewing all the data about

292
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
These phrases so everybody's looking at a giant graph

293
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Projected on the wall

294
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
You're slightly u-shaped

295
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Curve there in that

296
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
Numbers

297
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
The hand with this photo take it down

298
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
And the hand like this photo would you please take it down

299
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
Our kind of the winter is here

300
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,799
That you see the person that's receiving a more direct message is higher 11% vs 4%

301
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,407
When is think they noticed is it anytime they use the word sorry in a phrase like a Robert

302
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,783
Sorry to bring this up would you please take it down. Yeah I'm sorry doesn't actually help it makes the numbers go down

303
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Really 7 and 9

304
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
Are the some of the low points and those are the ones that say sorry

305
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Tillich.

306
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Don't apologize

307
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
It's like it shifts

308
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,815
The responsibility back to you I guess it doesn't it's just

309
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
It's just

310
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,215
If it's like it says it's a linguistic psychology subtle thing

311
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
But one of the things that really struck me at this meeting

312
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Different subject

313
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
It is at the scientist in the room and they're looking at the graph taking in the numbers

314
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
A lot of them had this look on their face

315
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Holy

316
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
I'm just stunned and humbled at the numbers that we generally get an inmate

317
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
Annies at Amelia Simon Thomas from Berkeley

318
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,071
My background is in neuroscience and I'm used to studies where we look at 20 people and not sufficient to say something

319
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,679
General about how brains work in general or Facebook like people would scoff

320
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
A sample size

321
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
That's Rob Boyle who is a project manager Facebook the magnitudes that were used to working with her in the hundreds of

322
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
The Millions

323
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
It's kind of interesting, because there's been a lot of criticism recently

324
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
Especially in social science about the sample sizes

325
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
There's there too often filled with white undergraduate college kids and how can you generalize from that

326
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
So you could tell

327
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Some of the scientist in the room

328
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Example Docker Keltner

329
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Psychology

330
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
UC Berkeley

331
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Like oh my God look at

332
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
What we can do now

333
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Get all these different people

334
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,311
A different class background different countries to him this kind of work with Facebook

335
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
This could be the future of social science right here

336
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
There has never been a human Community like this

337
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
In human history

338
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
It's somewhere in the middle of all the excitement about the data and the speed at which they can now testings the bottleneck is no longer house

339
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Fast food

340
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
How things work is coming up with the right things to

341
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Andrew cerreto Quest

342
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
What is the statistical likelihood that I have been a guinea pig in one of your experiments

343
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
I believe a hundred percent

344
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,151
Any given person

345
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
It's Dan Farrell data scientist

346
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
When we look at any given person is probably currently involved in

347
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
What time different experiments

348
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Enable

349
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Supposed to

350
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
And different experimental things

351
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Kind of blew me back a little

352
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
That was like

353
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Ivan research sub

354
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
And I had no idea

355
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Coming up

356
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Everybody gets the idea

357
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
And the Lab Rats revolt

358
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Stay with us

359
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Hi there this

360
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
This is better so I was calling from London England

361
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551

Understanding of science

367
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Technology in the modern world

00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
And I'm here because I need your help

372
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
And I request

373
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

374
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

375
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
No did something

376
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

377
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,007
Kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

378
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

379
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

380
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

381
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023

Thank you so much

386
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
This is Radiolab and will pick up

387
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671
The story with Andrew zolli and I sitting in a meeting at Facebook headquarters

388
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
This is about a year-and-a-half ago we had just learned

389
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,583
That at any given moment any given Facebook user is part

390
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
10 experiments

391
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Once

392
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Without

393
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Their knowledge

394
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
And sitting there that meeting you know this was awhile ago we both were like

395
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Did we just hear that correctly

396
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
Kind of blew me back a little

397
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
I was like

398
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Ivan research

399
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Subject and I had no idea

400
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
End

401
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
I had that

402
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Moment of the

403
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Discovery on a Friday

404
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
And literally

405
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
The next day Saturday

406
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,351
This is scary the world had that experience

407
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,751
Facebook using you and me as Lab Rats for a Facebook experiment On Emotion

408
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,127
Barely a day after we gotten off the plane from Facebook headquarters the kerfuffle occurred

409
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:02,527
Facebook exposed as lab rats Lab Rats

410
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Nothing with your emotions

411
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
You may remember the story cuz for a hot second it was everywhere was all over Facebook

412
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,607
There was an academic paper had come out that showed that was scientist the company had intentionally manipulated you

413
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
User news feeds to study a person's emotional response

414
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
They basically tinkered with the news feeds about 700 thousand people

415
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,807
React if they saw more positive versus negative post and vice versa and they found an effective people saw a more positive

416
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
They would post more positive things themselves and vice versa effect

417
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,607
Tiny affect the results weren't really the story the real story was there Facebook

418
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
Who's messing with us

419
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
People went apoplectic

420
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
Very uncomfortable and some people went so far as to argue

421
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,415
Different person

422
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
Had a psychological psychiatric disorder manipulating their social world

423
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,191
Could cause him real hard make sure you read those terms and conditions my friend that's what that's the big takeaway

424
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
What you hear is a sense of betrayal

425
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
The I really wasn't aware that this space of mine was being

426
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Treated me twice and I was part of your

427
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Psychological experiments

428
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
That's Kate Crawford principal researcher at Mike's

429
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,855
Visiting professor at MIT strong critica Facebook throughout the

430
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
There's a power imbalance

431
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,999
I think when we look at the way that experiment was done it's an example of

432
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,839
Highly centralized power and highly opaque power at work

433
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,423
I don't want to see it's been a situation where we just have to blindly Trust

434
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
The platforms are looking out for us

435
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Here I'm thinking of

436
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
I want to know your face book study actually

437
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
Back in 2010 where they did a study looking at whether they could increase

438
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Voter turnout

439
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Quite simple design they

440
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
They came up with

441
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
You're a little

442
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Fox

443
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
Pop and show you what your nearest voting booth

444
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
What is an MA

445
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
Ditto in addition to that when you voted he's a button you can press it says I voted and then you'll also see the pictures of six of

446
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Your friends

447
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
What this change

448
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
The number of people who went

449
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
And Facebook found that it did that if you saw a bunch of pictures

450
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Have your friends

451
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Who had voted

452
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Can you sell those pictures on Election Day

453
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
You were then 2% more likely to click the I voted

454
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Yourself presumably

455
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Because you two had gone out and

456
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
Not 2% might not sound like a lot

457
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
But it was not in Tagalog and I think by the order of

458
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
340000 V

459
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
Device that they estimate they actually

460
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Shift

461
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
These are people who wouldn't have voted and who they have said in there in paper and toilet paper

462
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
They increase the number of I said I buy

463
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
A340

464
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
Simply by saying that your neighbor has a tattoo

465
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Yeah by your friends

466
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
My first reaction to this

467
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Awesome it was

468
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Okay I mean

469
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
We're at historic

470
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
I closed when it comes to

471
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Turn out

472
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,856
This sounds like a good thing yes but what happens if someone's running a platform that

473
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,256
I really wish them this candidate is Canada's going to Lookout noches

474
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
The Mind Trust

475
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
The interest of the technology sector and I think they're

476
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
They're great candidate

477
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
Why don't we just show that get out

478
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Message

479
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
That little system design that we have

480
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
To the people who

481
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
Clearly because we already have that political preferences

482
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
I want to come to agree with us

483
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
And the people who disagree with

484
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
They weren't get this little nugget

485
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Now that is a prayer

486
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Found democratic

487
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Power that you have

488
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Kate Spacek

489
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,720
Position is it when it comes to social engineering which is what this is

490
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Companies

491
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
People using

492
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Really

493
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,888
Fact when when Andrew mentioned to her

494
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Arturo had this group and the group had a name called the trust Engineering Group

495
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
His job is to engineer

496
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Trust

497
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
When Andrew told her that Facebook

498
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
You smacking your forehead

499
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
Hard these ideas that we could somehow

500
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
Engineer compassion

501
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
I think to some degree have a kind of

502
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Hubris in them

503
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
Who are we to decide

504
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
Whether we can make somebody more compassion or not

505
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
How to do highlights

506
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
Couple months after a first interview we spoke to Arturo Behar

507
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Again

508
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Kerfuffle is dying down

509
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
We asked him about

510
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
All the Uproar

511
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
I know this is not your work

512
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
List emotions contagious

513
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
Literally like

514
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Hours

515
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
After we got back from that meeting

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
That thing erupted

517
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Do you understand the backlash

518
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
No I mean I think that

519
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
How many we

520
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
We really care about the people for you

521
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Facebook

522
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
I don't think there's such a thing as

523
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
As

524
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
How many finishing up learned in this world

525
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Is that

526
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
You really have

527
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
2 respect

528
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
People's response

529
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Emotions

530
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
No matter what they are

531
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
He said the whole thing definitely

532
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Made them text

533
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
There was a moment of concern of what it would mean to the world

534
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
I thought there was like this is this going to

535
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
Is this going to be in that

536
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Happy Cow

537
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Do this

538
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Part of music

539
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Big Al's, here is actually one

540
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
Reclaim back the word emotion

541
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
And reclaim back

542
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
The ability to do

543
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,880
Very thoughtful and careful experiment want to come back to work experiment

544
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Where you want to reclaim it

545
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
From

546
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Rimowa

547
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Well

548
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,096
Suddenly like the word emotion in the word experiment on these things became really charged

549
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
Oh yeah because I almost thought that Facebook

550
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Focus manipulator

551
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Emotion in there

552
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
It's right in in in in in the talking about right now

553
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
All of the work that we do

554
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Begins

555
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
With a person asking us

556
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
For help this is Arturo's

557
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
Most emphatic point he said it over and over

558
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
You know

559
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Facebook isn't just doing this for

560
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392
4fun people are asking for help they need help

561
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,792
Which point the one of the biggest challenges of living online just that you know offline

562
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Can we try and engineer trust offline for at least

563
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
Read one another we do it in the super subtle ways using eye contact and facial

564
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,896
Expressions in posture and tone of voice all this nonverbal stuff and of course when we go online

565
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
We don't have access to any of that in the absence of that feedback

566
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
How do we

567
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,672
Communicate what what does communication turn into

568
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,280
Best thrift on this I got to say is a Louis CK on Conan

569
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
It's just this thing

570
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
It's bad

571
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,656
Is a scrape bit about technology and kids

572
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Your kids are mean

573
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
And it's cuz you're trying it out

574
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Fat

575
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Anime see the kids face scrunch up in the doesn't feel good too

576
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
McPherson

577
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,712
Do that tonight that you put together start with doing the mean

578
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
When they write your

579
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Bat

580
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,600
Religious cult that was fun I like that

581
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Antioch

582
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Back to Arturo I mean I think

583
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
How about

584
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
Like what it means to be

585
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
In the presence of a friend or a lover

586
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
And

587
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
And how are you build experiences

588
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,288
That facilitate that

589
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
When you cannot be physically

590
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Together

591
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
Arturo says that's really all he's up to his just tryna nut

592
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
What tiny bit

593
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Senator

594
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Online sales are a little bit closer

595
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
To how they are off

596
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
And I got to say if he can do that

597
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,000
By engineering a couple of phrases like hey Robert would you mind etcetera etcetera will them I'm all for it

598
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Why not take the position

599
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
That to create a company

600
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
It stands between two people who

601
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Who are interacting

602
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,592
And then giving them boxes and statuses and and a little

603
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,432
An advertising until this is now

604
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Doing a service this is just

605
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
This is

606
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,648
This is a way to win yourself into the ordinary business of social intercourse

607
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
And make money on

608
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
I know you're acting like this group of people now is going to try to

609
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
To create a vehicle

610
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
The moral equivalent of an actual conversation if it's probably not engineer above and second I don't believe

611
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,032
Leave that for a moment cuz they're going to just

612
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,920
Going figure out other ways in which to make a revenue enhancer no I don't think it's one of the other I think they're in it

613
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
For the money in fact if

614
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
They can figure this out and make

615
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
The internet universe

616
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
More inclusive

617
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
To trust

618
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Less annoying

619
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,464
It could mean trillions of dollars so yeah it's the money

620
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
But still that doesn't negate the fact that we have to build the system

621
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,376
Right that we have to make the internet a little bit better that's fine

622
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
This idea however

623
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
That

624
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
You're going to have

625
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
How to coach people

626
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Intervals

627
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Subtleties

628
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Use of the relay

629
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Tell him you're sorry

630
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
Tell him to do so here's the formula for this

631
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
He doesn't want he did some of you you need

632
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,880
To repair the here are the seven ways you might repair that to do all that

633
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
It's

634
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
It's as if the Hallmark card company

635
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,792
Instead of living only on Mother's Day

636
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:56,192
Father's Day and birthdays just spread its wings out into the hole

637
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
First of July

638
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
I don't think that's a wonderful thing

639
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
I think you know I was like I didn't offend you

640
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
I mean yeah I keep in mind how this thing came about I mean they tried to get

641
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
People to talk to each other they gave him the blank to

642
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
Xbox One nobody used it

643
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
Right today like okay let's come up with some stock phrases that yes

644
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Are generic

645
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
But think about the next step

646
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
After you send the message

647
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
It's saying you know Jab

648
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,840
I like the photo please take it down presumably then you and I get into a conversation maybe I

649
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Explain myself I say

650
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
Oh my God I'm so sorry I didn't realize

651
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
You didn't like that

652
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
But I just thought

653
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
That was an amazing night

654
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
I just thought that was a great night I didn't realize you thought you looked

655
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
So sorry I'll take it down

656
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
School signal

657
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,504
Unfortunately we're having that conversation as a Next Step

658
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,832
How many of the birthday cards that you sent to first cousins

659
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Have resulted in a conversation

660
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:53,280
Maybe I'll see that's the thing I'm actually not they're really the opposite of what you're saying their conversation substitute

661
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
Maybe

662
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Maybe their conversation starters

663
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
Maybe that's the Deep experiment

664
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,472
Are they conversation starters or substance

665
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
I hope their conversation starters

666
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Yeah

667
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,568
Cuz maybe that would be a beginning

668
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
It kind of my mind goes back

669
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
2

670
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
Like the beginning of the automobile age

671
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
This is how we interpret

672
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
There was a time

673
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
When automobiles were new

674
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
And you know they didn't have

675
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Turn signals

676
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
The tools they did have like the horn

677
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
Didn't necessarily indicate

678
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
All the things that we use that indicate wasn't clear what the horn was actually there to do was it there to say hello or is it the

679
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
There to take it out of the way

680
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
And overtime

681
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
We created norms

682
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,152
We created roads with Lanes

683
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
We created turn signal

684
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
That

685
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
Primarily there for other people

686
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,320
So that we can coexist in this great

687
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Flow without crashing into

688
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
And we still have road rage

689
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,256
And we still have road rage we still have places where those tools are incomplete

690
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
Text andrew selley many many many many

691
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
With me for so long and all Metro keeps who you kept bringing back into the studio to thank you very much

692
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
To Arturo in all team over there

693
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
By the way they have changed their name

694
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
It's no longer trust engineering is

695
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
The Facebook

696
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Protecting hair team really

697
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
Weirton original music this hour from mooninite thanks to them

698
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
Props to animals for production support

699
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,776
And I also a Andrews Ali put together a blog post

700
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,176
You got to radiolab.org you can see it we can cover some really interesting research that we didn't get a chance to talk about

701
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
If you ever sent an email with little :-)

702
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
You're definitely going to want to read this

703
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,112
Radiolab.org I'm chatting rod
