1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,264
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,128
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
And NPR

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
Hey I'm Jared

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,184
This is Radiolab and a couple of days ago as in like

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
7

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
We we were on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music the big opera house they're really beautiful theater and it was full

00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
Thousand people we were part of something close radiolovefest

00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Radial effects is a big public radio broadcasting radio loving thing

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
That WNYC station here puts on basic it's a parade of all these amazing public radio shows in pot

12
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Guess we open the Fest

13
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
It was called radiolovefest

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
We figured we would use the opportunity to

15
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,328
Basically talked about the community of people around Radiolab that we love

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
The Producers the musicians

17
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
Featuring amazing acts like

18
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
So percussion Hoosier hearing

19
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:18,848
A lot of stuff happened and we told our story today we're just on this podcast we're going to play two stories for you

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Ghost stories about

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Love

22
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
About heart

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
The last one wish you were here

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
Is a is an exclusive interview with Oliver Sacks

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Paisley

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
Give me a kind of valedictory interview

27
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Pretty wonderful

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
We decided

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
How to do literally

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
I look at a heart

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
This comes to my producer Molly Webster it was scored live by

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
So percussion

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Which is Eric Chou Beach Josh Quillen Jason treuting and Adam zielinski and some people in the audience in theater on inside a pretty

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
Be strong reaction to what you are about to hear

35
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
And we are not

36
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
So sure that that may not also be the case if you

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
You just listening

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,856
So if you are driving or operating Machinery maybe this isn't the best piece to listen to cuz it can get a little

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
Intense which will talk about little bit afterwards

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
In the meantime here is

41
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
Producer Molly Webster

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,840
So this is a story about a friend's summer Ash we used to work together

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
And I think it's fair to say that

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Summer has a

45
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Complicated relationship with her heart

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
You know my heart was not beating

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
For 3 hours

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
This is a really crazy.

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
I was

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Technically

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Hart dead

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
I don't know

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
So couple of things to know about summer

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
She's like Wicked

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Smart she's an astrophysicist

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Cheese has a lot of Big Y

57
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
Propulsion center of gravity and moment of inertia

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
X and Y

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
Remember that original like radial keratotomy

60
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Like no I don't even know what that

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Where it is

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
The other thing to know is she's in

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Engineer writes she loves like

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Take things

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Depart

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
You sort of like

67
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Poke around

68
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Rewire

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Ratchet

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,648
And so the thing to know is when she found out she had to go

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
Get heart surgery she made sure there was someone in the operating room

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
With a camera

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Of my open chest

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
And the valve

75
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
And when things were

76
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,472
Haircuts and when things are being sown in

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Completely as a scientist

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
I want to know what's happening

79
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,152
I want to know why I want to know what you're doing I want to know what's going on around me

80
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Start a backup in

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Explain

82
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Summer

83
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Was just

84
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
The following up on like a heart diagnosis

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Happened about

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
18 years earlier

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
And so she had been diagnosed with a murmur

88
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Which is basically

89
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Funny sound in ear

90
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Your heart

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
And that's in between the thumb thumb

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Dlanter this was just

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
The follow-up

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Sure nothing

95
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
And so she goes to

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Did the doctor

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
They run a few tests

98
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
They sent her on her way and

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
A few weeks later

100
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
It's an email

101
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Don't panic

102
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
But I think you should see a heart surgeon

103
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
It turns out the situation with her

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Carhartt hatching

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Her aorta which is

106
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Like the largest

107
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Artery coming out of

108
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Her heart it was

109
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Larger than

110
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Then it should have been

111
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
It's supposed to be about

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
2 cm in diameter and in summer

113
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Yeah what does that mean for your body

114
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
So that's the thing

115
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
It's asymptomatic

116
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
It's not actively harming you but it's

117
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Threat to your life

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,647
Because if it rupture it's your main blood vessel and if it goes

119
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
You bleed out internally so fast

120
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
No ER can help you her doctor says go find a heart surgeon and in the meantime

121
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Are contact Sports

122
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Summer is like a live in New York

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
Like living in New York is a contact sport people crashing you all the time

124
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
Six months later summer find yourself on the operating table they actually

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
I think I'm not sure the exact order of operations

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,999
But they open her sternum from the bottom all the way up to the top

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
And then they just said

128
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,375
You pull back a rib cage so they can get at her

129
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
They put some sort of

130
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Fluid on it that

131
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Stop that from

132
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,055
And they actually started just inject that fluid into the heart

133
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
And that short-circuits

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
So your heart actually

135
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Stops

136
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
And then

137
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
A hook you up

138
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
2

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
A bypass

140
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
A heart-lung bypass

141
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
And one of the things that does is it

142
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Drains the heart of all its blood so it's like flat like a pancake and you can see picture

143
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Pictures of all of this on her blog you can even see pictures true you can even see pictures of

144
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
The surgeon cutting 4in out of her aorta and replacing it with

145
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
The synthetic to

146
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
And the entire time Summers heart is

147
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Just Lim

148
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
In quiet

149
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
8 hours later

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
She wakes up

151
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
What do you remember

152
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
About your first conversation

153
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
With your doctors

154
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
Oh I don't remember my first conversation much

155
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
But I do vividly remember my first thought

156
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Part of my friends

157
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
This

158
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Just mind-altering

159
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Pain

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
Oh my God 8 hours ago I felt

161
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
So much better than this can we just go back to that now like Joe

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
You know everything pulls on your torso

163
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
And so when your sternum pain

164
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Cut open and then reconnected

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,695
Everything that pulls on that hurts you can't move anything

166
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Or List anything

167
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
It hurt to talk

168
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
It even hurt to breathe

169
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
But literally from

170
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Day one

171
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
They make you stand up

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,495
And start

173
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
Waukee

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
Really I was like she was like we're going to get you to send child

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,223
And that's just too

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
That's just too

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
Basically just got to get the heart going again

178
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
You know just get it healing

179
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
But here's the thing

180
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
When it came back

181
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
It came back

182
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
With a vengeance

183
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,655
3 Fairhill recovery went really well about 2 months in she's in car

184
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Rehab the pain is fading

185
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
She's thinking about sending her mother home her mom at

186
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Staying with her for a while

187
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
And then one day she's in cardiac rehab

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
On the elliptical

189
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
And so I remember stopping

190
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
And I had

191
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
This white T-shirt

192
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
That would

193
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Literally

194
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Fluttering

195
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
With my heart

196
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
Like it was blowing in high winds or something

197
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
You mean that

198
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
You could see it

199
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
Yeah even though the physical therapist there could see it

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Will it rain

201
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
Give me give me like you would look down and you'll see the thing

202
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Your heart beating

203
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Through your chest wall

204
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Pushing you

205
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Shirt off

206
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Well

207
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Because I'm a lady

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
There is a gap here so like that

209
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Sort of there's a space for that vibration

210
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
So to speak

211
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
But then she goes home and it was still half a

212
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
Like just sitting on a couch not even working out she's like woah my heart is strong it just fell

213
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
So strong that I heard of me was like as it seems like

214
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
So one day

215
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,807
A few months after surgery she goes to Upstate New York

216
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,903
He's visiting some family friends and she's hanging out with their daughter Julia

217
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
She walked in in

218
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
We're sending in

219
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
My room

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
They're just chatting

221
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
And it's suddenly Julia's eyes get really wide

222
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,727
Feeling there's a oh my God I just I just heard it

223
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
She could hear Summers heart

224
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Out loud

225
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
2 feet away from

226
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
In the room

227
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
And I was like okay this is happening

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
So I guess in typical summer fashion

229
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,111
And she's kind of like let's engineer this if a friend of mine can hear it with her ear what could a studio pickup

230
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
She grabs a radio producer friend

231
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Studio and he sticks

232
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
A mic about 6in

233
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
In front of her chest

234
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
And this is what they recorded

235
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
This is not a stethoscope this is what it's

236
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
Sounds like if you were standing a quiet room next to Summer God that's strong what does that feel

237
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
You like it just feels as if my entire rib cage

238
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
Age my clavicle my sternum my whole chest cavity is acting like an amp

239
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
It is sort of transmitting the vibrations of each heartbeat in fizz

240
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Physically in my body to feel each heartbeat

241
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
It feels like somebody has a rubber mallet and it's banging on the inside of my sternum

242
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,999
It is very staccato

243
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,359
When she goes back to the doctor she's like dude my heart

244
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,735
So he sort of just did some like listening and some feeling haha you know what his reaction to was like

245
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
So we run some tests and he's like listen your blood pressure is fine

246
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
All of your stats are fine

247
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
So

248
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
I guess I did a really good job Yay good for you but okay I guess I have a strong heart

249
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
Yeah a strong heart but I don't want to feel this all the time the doctor was like what

250
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
Probably just that there is scar tissue on your sternum

251
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
And it's transmitting the vibration

252
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
And his back goes away the sea

253
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Fade he said

254
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Sometimes 6 to 9 months

255
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
This is when

256
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Maybe the scar tissue

257
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Heels more spins out

258
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
Does she's like all right so I can get to that

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
That's no problem

260
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
Sushi sorta just settled in and treated it like a sign

261
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Lego party

262
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
If I went to

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
A restaurant

264
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
Where they had like tables for two

265
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
But they weren't like this

266
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Sturdiest of tables

267
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
If we had water glass

268
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Houses on them and I

269
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Hive

270
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Leaned on the table

271
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Water glass

272
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Looks like Jurassic Park like my heartbeat would be like the

273
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Footsteps of the tired

274
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
Yeah so that was like my parties

275
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
If you had six months of elation party trick and then

276
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Yeah and then it stopped being a party

277
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Yeah

278
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
What happened

279
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
And I'm not really sure like

280
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
You know incident wise I think for me it was just time passing

281
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Cuz that 9-month Mark

282
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Just came and went

283
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
He was still there

284
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
And when she asks her doctor he has no idea why

285
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
12 months

286
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Still there

287
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
15 months

288
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Still there

289
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,375
And she says it just started getting really annoying distracting

290
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
The funny thing was the more active I was

291
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
Then the less aware of it I was

292
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847
She says when she was at her office trying to be still be still

293
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
To either be writing something writing emails

294
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Planning lectures

295
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
That's what it would be like

296
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
Really loud that's when it would become the most dominant thing like I couldn't go to

297
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,815
Work because it just kept drawing my focus

298
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
And when it did it would just feel her with anxiety it was sort of this like

299
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Automatic response and I'll try and explain if it's basically like when you get scared it goes into your

300
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
Brain and then the signal goes down into your body do you step on a snake and your brain is like oh my God it's a state-run body

301
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
And then your heart

302
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
In summers case it was just the opposite there's no snake but her heart was pounding their brain

303
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Would be like oh why is my heart pounding oh my God is there snakes there must be a snake run buddy run

304
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Workout

305
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
My brain keeps thinking something must be wrong because we're having we're already doing this

306
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
So something must be wrong so I guess something's wrong so let's freak out she was caught in this feedback loop and then

307
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
And she was like rightly so edgy and Prime that any emotion on top of that like even if it was

308
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Happiness is just too much oh my gosh it would keep me awake

309
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
I would get into hearing the Rhythm feeling the Rhythm

310
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,471
You sort of with the expectation of just next one

311
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
Fun

312
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Fun fun

313
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
Next one next one next one next one

314
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
Next one next one next one

315
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Next one next one next one

316
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
Next

317
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,943
With Every Beat our hearts are just literally tapping out time and

318
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Actually thought about this and there was this idea that was proposed like a right before the dawn episode of Modern hearts

319
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,231
Surgery that we each get 1 billion beats In Our Lifetime and then that's it

320
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,631
And most of us don't notice them going by but in summers case you can't not notice it that I'm aware of it all

321
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
It's never not there it's never not noticeable

322
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
That beat and it's just like this constant awareness of the future that summer is

323
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Endlessly meditating on my heart takes over and I can't do the things that I want to do and

324
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
Not knowing if that's going to last forever or if it's going to end suddenly or

325
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,607
Going to Peter out but not knowing gets me

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
So she stopped going out as much

327
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,055
She stopped returning phone calls except for like a few close group of friends the worst times we're just

328
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Curled up in bed

329
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
And just

330
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Is crying

331
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
I really want

332
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Yell at my heart shut up

333
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Stop would you really talk to her

334
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Well I mean I've never had conversations

335
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
But I would be like

336
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
But it wouldn't

337
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
And as time went on

338
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Like the constant pounding

339
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
Just became unbearable she describes it as like this alien creature

340
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
Is like trying to claw its way out the bottom of my neck

341
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
But there was this one moment

342
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Right in the middle of all of this

343
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,695
She had her 2-year check up post-surgery

344
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
And for that they had to take up

345
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
A picture of her heart

346
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
So I schedule my

347
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
Two-year appointment and to look at heart they do and

348
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Which is basically a you know like the ultrasound

349
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Like that you got for the pregnant

350
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Yeah it's like a little a little while and then you get the Jelly

351
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,151
We basically go all over

352
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Your upper

353
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
You know the area around your heart

354
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
I from all different angles

355
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
So what ended up happening is I'm lying on my

356
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Left side and I'm facing the wall in the

357
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Technicians by me

358
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
And the technician is sort of like reaching around her waving the wand

359
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Her heart

360
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
And the monitor for the echocardiogram is

361
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Find summer so she can't see it but

362
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
She's wearing eyeglass

363
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
So you know how you can sometimes like see a reflection

364
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Peripherally on glasses

365
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Something behind you

366
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,919
Like if you were in a somewhat darker room there was a window like you totally Caesars

367
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
So the rooms a little bit darkened

368
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
Somers lying there on her side

369
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
And she sees the reflection of a

370
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Screen

371
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Oh my glasses

372
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
And it catches our eye because

373
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
If it's moving

374
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Then I realize what it is that I'm

375
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
I'm seeing

376
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
A tiny reflection of her heartbeat

377
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
And I have this

378
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Moment

379
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
I have this moment where I'm like

380
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Oh my gosh

381
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
You're my talking to my heart in my head going

382
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
We had you're working hard

383
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Like you're trying your hardest you're doing the best that you can

384
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
I'm doing the best that I can you're in there and you're working and you are working for me

385
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
We are on the same team

386
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
And I just totally like I just silently sir

387
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Crying

388
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
What do you think

389
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Bird that on like what was it about

390
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Seeing it

391
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
There's just something about physically seeing it

392
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Pump

393
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,687
And but feeling it at the same time like knowing that I'm seeing what's happening inside me

394
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
That somehow just like

395
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
Flicked this understanding into place

396
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,231
She said there was something about seeing it in real-time like a feeling this thing in her chest

397
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,351
Just pulsing in rhythm with what was happening on the screen and then suddenly just

398
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
It didn't seem separate from her anymore and all those worries about the future and what was going to happen and was

399
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
Going to go away. Stopped no

400
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
You are just beating

401
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
And that thing is me

402
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
It was sort of a sort of like this moment of

403
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Of recognition of its

404
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Purpose and its work and

405
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
And sort of this

406
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,559
It's kind of like that whole idea of when you feel like you see somebody

407
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Not just physically like you see who they are

408
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
You see what they are but you see who they are

409
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
You had that like I felt like ice

410
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
CU heart

411
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Like I said

412
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
See what you're doing

413
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
See what your purpose is

414
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
I see you on the one hand what she sees like with her

415
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
Engineers brain Izzo

416
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
Realization that eventually led to modern medicine right like the minute we took the soul out of the heart

417
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Touch it to cut it open a stitch it up to start fixing things and now we have life spans if I some s

418
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,847
Estimates are 2.5 billion beats on the other hand

419
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:08,991
When you hear someone's heartbeat your parents or your child

420
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:15,647
Is an entire lifetime it's a it's a history of Beats it's a series of

421
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
Beats yet to come and thinking about

422
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,192
Summer asked us if we wanted to try and listen to her

423
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,056
Can we try that just see if you want to just move the microwave

424
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll Stand Up

425
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
So she stood up from her chair

426
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
How to put a chest

427
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Right in front of the mic and then we all do

428
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Just got really quiet

429
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Oh my God

430
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Oh my god wow it just makes me really emotional everytime I hear it it makes my eyes well with

431
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
It's really amazing

432
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Guess I still got it

433
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Good job

434
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Hugo

435
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
So give it up for Radiolab producer Molly Webster

436
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
And giving up your self protection

437
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,384
That one we said earlier that a lot of people in the audience had strong reactions

438
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
You're so I don't know if you could do the same but like when we were doing that story I should definitely seem like something's going on out there

439
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Cuz we were on state I couldn't answer their 20 something going on in the oven is something going on stage but I didn't really know

440
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
It was we were in the middle of it

441
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Walk off stage

442
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
And the first thing we hear is that

443
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,424
Numerous people had fainted even vomited during that piece we were like

444
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
What

445
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,824
Seriously I did not see it coming we really really scared

446
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
And I thought oh my God I might get my killing people like it was just like

447
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,880
Are they old

448
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
Maybe I can handle it

449
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
I just was and then I kind of

450
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,072
Weirdly mortified terrified but if we figured out that no one was hurt

451
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
We were like we got

452
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
We're like

453
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
Would you start putting out my start making some calls to me like what

454
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:43,360
We make it that I didn't know you thought you was a show is over and we all go home days after

455
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Listen to podcast

456
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,064
The damn thing right with the Swift understand this in the I sound that is completely right

457
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
The first person we called was a psychiatrist

458
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Rachel Yehuda

459
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of psychiatry

460
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
How was he born

461
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,424
Mitre have any 5 or 6 people out of 2200

462
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Somewhere between 5

463
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
And

464
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
12

465
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,152
We don't have a clear number just yet. What might have caused this

466
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Just like a guess

467
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
So my best guess about that would be that they have activated their parasympathetic nerves

468
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
System

469
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
In response to hearing the heartbeat

470
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,560
You just explain our autonomic nervous system is divided into a bunch of different parts you've got your sympathetic nervous system disorder

471
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Fireflight right

472
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Sweat turns on when you're

473
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,448
Scared then you got your parasympathetic nervous system which

474
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Is sort of the opposite

475
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
Rather than getting you ready to fight or run

476
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
It makes you calm

477
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,176
Dr. Yehuda says it in certain people that parasympathetic response

478
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,784
Kenexa kind of go overboard and their blood pressure can drop

479
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Quickly too quickly

480
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,136
And they end up painting the most common

481
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Give me a list for this to happen in

482
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
In real life is

483
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Fainting at the sight of blood

484
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Some people just do that and it's

485
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
Not that comment about you

486
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
4% of the population

487
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Have is kind of a

488
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,616
And we don't exactly know why it happens there is

489
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,456
Summit Canyon de TI Dia of fainting when you see blood

490
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,528
Is it an Adaptive evolutionary response

491
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
That you know maybe back in the day when we were being chased by Predators it would have been a good idea to faint or dead

492
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Nahel skip you

493
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,560
He wants live meet and you're dead meat to eat that

494
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
I already.

495
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Another

496
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
A theory is an alternate evolutionary what is it

497
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,544
If your blood pressure drops like it does when you faint that kind of protects you a little bit because

498
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
You'll have less blood in your arms and legs

499
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
So if your arms legs get bitten by a lion say then you're less likely to bleed out

500
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
There's nothing juicy to suck on

501
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
If your blood is I'm not in your

502
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Winger your limb

503
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
Yeah who knows these are just stories but

504
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,512
Going back to the two or 4% thing we got to thinking

505
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
2 to 4% of our audience at night

506
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Would be

507
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
What we decide Molly was it would be 44 to 88

508
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
44 288c 2200

509
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
So we put out some emails look at the incident reports

510
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
And I think now we have identified

511
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,808
I need us we've heard of maybe 10 or 11

512
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
1011 it but I think

513
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,976
It based on some of the stories are coming in that the number might actually be much higher

514
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Example it just manifested itself physically in a way that I

515
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
Could not have imagined

516
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
I would be the case

517
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
This is Maria chaveco

518
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
Actually works down the street from us

519
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,360
For the company that makes Latino USA

520
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
I was sitting in the front

521
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
Against one of the walls but not right at the wall

522
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,832
She says she was listening to the story everything was fine at first but then

523
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136
She does as the beat kept going

524
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
She began to worry

525
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
What if it never stops what if someone never gets away from it

526
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
And then the drama and got more intense and it was

527
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Pono

528
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,984
Oh no and it was definitely the sense of being trapped that the thing that was giving her life

529
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,336
Which was absolutely necessary was also the thing that was

530
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Tormenting

531
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
She says that she was thinking about that

532
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
She just kind of got

533
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Short of breath

534
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
I looked at my husband

535
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
Put my hands up like

536
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Like I got to go

537
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
And he looked me he was like are you are right and I was like

538
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
I shook my head

539
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
And

540
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,584
And I and then I had to talk in my brain like okay

541
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
This is an intimate radio moment

542
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
You are right in the front area if you get up

543
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,312
6 people have to get up with you what are you doing you're ruining this for everybody

544
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Just Breathe

545
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:03,712
And it'll be fine and then the deeper I tried to breathe the more anxious I sort of got

546
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
And I have this fantasy of like

547
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,160
Standing up and doing like a ruler

548
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
But I was like that's

549
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Suck it up

550
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
And so

551
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,472
I thought I'm having trouble breathing just thinking about it I don't put no no no no I'm fine I'm fine

552
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
That's what my hunches

553
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
There might be a lot more than 10 because

554
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,104
Maybe a lot of people just pushed

555
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Through and didn't get up at 6

556
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,760
Still felt weird case one of the most interesting things we bumped into is that doctor you told us it's

557
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
It's very pause

558
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,392
At the fainting in the woods penis

559
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Really

560
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
In what sense

561
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Well

562
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
If you hear somebody's heart

563
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Beading

564
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
And you're aware that that's what you're hearing it might arouse of tremendous connection within you

565
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Of hearing the very source of their life

566
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Yeah I became her

567
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,128
I did I just I was there with her and

568
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,016
Will it be a lot to take in and you feel a little faint or emotional I just identified

569
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
So much with somebody being

570
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
Trapped in their own body I thought she couldn't escape

571
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
It was beating in my chest

572
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,304
The drums I felt were beating in my chest and in my

573
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
Crazy fantasy you know maybe they were beating at the same Rhythm one of the people that you emailed after the live show said that

574
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
He felt like his

575
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Heart was

576
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
Trying to match her beat

577
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,944
And he couldn't catch his breath I don't know I haven't I don't know it's never happened to me before

578
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,832
Highest Indian if you ever want to hear someone's heart beat again and she said oh yeah

579
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,904
In fact she said she's going to listen to the story as soon as it was podcast

580
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Which is now

581
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
Is that she's got all these questions like what

582
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
The Acoustics of the space

583
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
What's fact

584
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Issues with so many people or

585
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Videos of volume

586
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,192
It's pretty loud and will I feel the same when I hear it

587
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,776
You know with my headphones on or you know while I'm driving

588
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,872
Will I have that feeling so I had already decided that I was definitely going to listen to

589
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Will let you know what

590
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,256
Toyota brakes when it's so percussion you provided all the music so far

591
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,424
They just released an album called music for wood and strings written by Bryce dessner of the national this is what you're hearing

592
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
It's kind of an amazing piece

593
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
If you want to check it out go to so percussion.com will also linked to

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

601
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,776
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

602
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:14,176
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

603
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

604
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:22,880
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something

605
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

606
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,608
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

607
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

608
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score in math class

609
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,384
Is there ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

610
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
We're interested in the

611
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,320
Specific moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

612
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
If you have a story please share it with us

613
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,256
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

We'll see but we've got them for you at Radiolab.

623
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
We want to finish the night with a salute to a guy who's been on our program and part of our family pretty much from the beginning

624
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
I have known him

625
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776

00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,176
Early I'm going to Radiolab started I asked him if he'd help us out and send us a few story ideas he didn't send us a few he sent us

627
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
Bushel Tales of chemistry in medicine hallucinations music people so many extra

628
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Ordinary people that he knew

629
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Founder help

630
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Cuz I just doesn't run out

631
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Dr. Oliver Sacks

632
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Neurologist taco

633
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
Is a guy who notices

634
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
Everything is deeply interested in

635
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
Everything that happens around him into him and tonight we're bringing it back on tape

636
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,152
But alas maybe his final offering Frost as many of you know

637
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
Dr. Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver cancer

638
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,320
And you wrote about this in the New York Times he said he plans to spend the time that he has

639
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Laugh

640
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Writing

641
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
Be with friends not doing interviews but he did agree to share his thoughts

642
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Exclusively with

643
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Tonight

644
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Are you Galaxy

645
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Cuz he's one of our family

646
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,960
So as I've done for decades now I went over his house in Manhattan with my Mike and I sent

647
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
I just need to know what just

648
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
A month-and-a-half ago you were fine

649
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
And then

650
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
I see beginning of the year I was fine

651
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,344
On the 3rd of January I feel Sandoval queer

652
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
And I tossed some dark urine

653
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
I thought I said little girl bladder attack

654
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
Didn't pay that much attention

655
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
But thought I better get things checked

656
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
And then

657
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
Vxrail

658
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
Is expected only to show a couple of gallstones

659
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Chode

660
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
FAFSA

661
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
And my liver

662
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Alumadock

663
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
How to say he didn't know what his will and I would

664
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Need further tests

665
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
I

666
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
I knew what they were

667
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
I said it's

668
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,256
He's right the doctors eventually confirmed

669
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,864
A cancer that has been found in his eye 9 years ago had spread to his liver

670
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Were you

671
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Peyton

672
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Or

673
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Relieve orcas

674
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Sore

675
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
But you know I am

676
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
I think my first feeling was one of

677
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Overwhelming sad

678
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
They're also

679
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Strings

680
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
I will see

681
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
And I will do

682
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
One or two people listen to me in

683
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
Consoling me

684
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,608
But f*** it it's not like we all die

685
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
It's like you have four months

686
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,568
Has that has your property is your prognosis at this moment cuz I know you had an

687
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,712
Well if it gets revised it depends of course on how is the cancer response to treatment sand

688
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Or how quickly it spreads

689
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
This is so far

690
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,648
The metastasis from my eye only in my liver

691
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,696
I told they love live

692
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,352
I love liver as well and I'm one of the magical things I did was going to have liver and onions

693
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
Sudoku

694
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,264
I'm thinking bad liver looks better than mine far away

695
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
This is what he's like instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him he's thinking about loving liver and liver lovers

696
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,736
Looking for connections and one really doesn't stop

697
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
He just notices it case in point

698
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,368
A few months ago his doctor said to him We're going to run out a line

699
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
Up your liver and ineffective going to straight shave off or start some of the cancer cells first on one side than the other

700
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Go to see if I can give you a little more time

701
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
But they warned him

702
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
How's the metastasis

703
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Guy

704
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
They put on farias contestant Kevin

705
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
Send me exhaust you text your system badly

706
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
At one point shortly after the procedure

707
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
I started talking a little strangely

708
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,504
And I'm as I was talking I was inviting

709
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
You'll be the first person to see this

710
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,440
So he showed me a notebook where song it

711
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
To you

712
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
In just a moment you can see this sort of

713
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,632
Writing there on the left it's all he's writing a book actually children's book about the elementary table

714
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,472
But as he was writing if you if you look to the next page

715
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
If you can see that it gets a little bit

716
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
Wobbly the letters and then

717
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
And then there was some

718
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Crossing out there

719
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Yes I see them then why the dramatic lie

720
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
The Whiting

721
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Change it

722
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
It actually scares a large

723
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,440
Slash across it and then you get seems a little incoherent at the palace

724
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
Okay pure

725
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Atlanta's delirium

726
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Krypton made

727
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,728
All this happened to the course of 10 minutes

728
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:34,336
I'm writing at a constant speed I know pretty much how fast I write

729
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:40,736
And so I can time this out I can figure out exactly how long it took me to slip into delirium out of

730
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,856
Of this delirium

731
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Animal Medical West

732
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
I think this was a lovely illustration

733
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,768
How to put in a timeline of delirium

734
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Coming like that

735
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Unusual

736
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
You don't seem too worried at all when things become incoherent

737
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
You're not showing it to me as if interested

738
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
I was crazy here for a little bit

739
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,808
The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there

740
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
I went time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike and by the way I I should show you what he look like

741
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
Take back then when he was

742
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,280
Driving his bike is I think it's him

743
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
In New York

744
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Kind of

745
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,400
You know

746
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,264
In the sixties he was also a champion weightlifter they called him doctor Squad

747
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
And in this picture that you show you here

748
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
That's him raising six

749
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
100 lb

750
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
In order to win a trophy like this is that he was a champ and and you can see more pictures like these that cuz we have signed copy

751
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
Copies of Oliver's Newman we're out for sale in the lobby

752
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Pretty good book too by the way

753
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,952
In any case at this time

754
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
The 1960s in addition to being

755
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:01,120
Muscled out however was a serious recreational drug taker

756
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:06,496
And because he's Oliver he was extremely curious about his high as no matter how weird they were

757
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
1 time for example you took

758
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
20 pills that he shouldn't have

759
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
And then to my surprise

760
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
How does a spider on the wall

761
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Set hello

762
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
Have a voice like that she's also

763
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
Famous mathematician

764
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,512
It cost me a wild a technical question as to whether Russell had exploded

765
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
Frege's paradox

766
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
And we had this

767
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,264
Conversation

768
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Cuz you you trust your perception

769
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,664
Okay many years later when I mentioned this to an entomologist

770
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Cornell

771
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
Philosophical spider

772
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
Inotes

773
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Taking it all in talking spiders whatever

774
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
The generosity of his curiosity becomes profoundly moving and transformative when he's tree

775
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,960
Treating his patients I want to tell onestar here really quickly do to demonstrate what I mean

776
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,544
I never once had a patient when he called mrs. OC

777
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
She was

778
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
An old woman she was 88 years old living in a nursing home

779
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
And one night she was awake and Jarred awake by a loud

780
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
I wish

781
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,744
It was a song

782
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
And she thought about somebody left the radio on but when she looked

783
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
3D when the room is on your roommate

784
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,728
Soundasleep which was odd because the song was really loud

785
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,824
The doors after that

786
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
There's another song

787
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
And then another song

788
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:59,648
Which Associates may be my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are are coming to the fillings in my teeth I've heard that spot

789
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,512
But no her doctor told her this is something in your head you need to see

790
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
A neurologist

791
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
Which led her to dr. Sachs

792
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
That when he met mrs. OC he she could barely hear him the song sung by the female boys were coming and coming she was

793
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,152
Frightened and justifiably worried that she was going crazy but Oliver said no no I'm going to do some tests

794
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
And when he was done

795
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:28,576
He said he found a slight stroke or condition that triggered musical epilepsy 87 production of music

796
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Picking her brain

797
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
Normal doctor might say okay we got the diagnosis and he thought that the songs would probably faint it will pass are they worth

798
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
But Oliver did not stop

799
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
He doesn't stop

800
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,448
He kept talking to her

801
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,104
She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born her mother when she was

802
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,711
Only five she was sent to America

803
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
For the Love of beading

804
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Make a note

805
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,855
She had no conscious memory

806
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
The first five years of her life

807
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,463
New memories

808
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
It's black

809
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
We asked her about the songs

810
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
What are they like

811
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,567
MS Associated well I think they're lullabies

812
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
Can you sing them for me

813
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
She did

814
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
And then after checking them not sure who I'll ever figured out that these songs what happened to be popular

815
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Irish ballads

816
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
From the 1890s where mrs. OC was a little baby

817
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
And I gave him an idea

818
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
What he does next isn't science

819
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
It isn't in any traditional way medicine

820
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
He just told her the story

821
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
And it goes like

822
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
You don't have nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three

823
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,543
Well there was a theory wants not honored much today but it's sad that those earliest memories

824
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
Get locked away deep in our brains in a special safe

825
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
The weekend never open

826
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
So let's suppose mrs. OC

827
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
But you are struck by some crazy chance

828
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,575
Open the lock that none of us can break

829
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
And release those first memories

830
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
In you

831
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Just for a little while

832
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
Show that The Voice you're listening to

833
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,279
The homeboy

834
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
Maybe that is in the radio boy

835
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Let's play

836
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
It's your mother's voice

837
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
Pets your missing mother

838
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,383
Until with the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms

839
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
You get to be a baby again

840
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
Images of the Seas thought about that

841
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Okay it's

842
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Sort of fit

843
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
I'm an old woman

844
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
Old people's home

845
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,231
But I feel I'm a child in Ireland

846
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
I feel my mother's arms I see

847
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
Ikea voicing

848
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
United

849
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
Clinton's wrong

850
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,359
Shortly thereafter the songs began to fade the pauses widen

851
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,687
Mrs. OC he's been so frightened by this music in her head was now

852
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
Sorry to see the songs go

853
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
But it was Oliver

854
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
Who noticed how those songs that touched her

855
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,927
Who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does

856
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
He listens closely

857
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
He can hear another person's heart

858
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
And this is really the

859
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
Profound puzzles for me

860
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
About Oliver

861
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,007
Because reading the new what a biography you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life

862
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
In relationships the really matter

863
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
It turns out he didn't get a whole lot of affection

864
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
He was for a long time a lonely guy I'd say he was

865
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Very lonely

866
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
And he's talking about that now for the first time

867
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Let me talk about love for a minute

868
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,487
In this book you tell the story of your of your very first love

869
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
A fella by the name of Richard

870
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Selleck

871
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Can you tell me what

872
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
What happened with him

873
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,983
Yeah she was a load Scala

874
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
A poet

875
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Unhandsome

876
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Beautiful

877
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
Beyond belief

878
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Anais

879
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Fell for him

880
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
Although I didn't

881
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Say anything

882
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Because I was some

883
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
Very haunted by my mother

884
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Accusations

885
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
What is your mother

886
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Well

887
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
The Google couple of years back then my father

888
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
How to open a conversation I was about to go to office

889
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
And I saw the Father song

890
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Conversation

891
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
Any setup

892
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
You don't seem to have many girlfriends

893
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
And I said

894
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
No

895
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,151
Wishing the conversation would stop

896
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
He said I'm

897
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,015
Something wrong with girls on my I said know that

898
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
That's fine

899
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
Pepsi prefer boys

900
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
And I said well

901
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Yes I do

902
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
I said I've never done nothing

903
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
But I do

904
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
I knew that then

905
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
I knew that

906
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Probably since I was 12

907
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
And I said

908
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Don't tell Mama

909
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
She will be able to take

910
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
But my

911
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Father

912
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
Did tell my mother in the night

913
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
And the next morning she came down with him

914
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
I somehow want to say that face of Comber

915
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
Enraged me

916
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,879
And my other thing said

917
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Joanne abomination

918
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
I wish you would never been born

919
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,511
And then she has something to shut up

920
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
And said nothing for 3 days

921
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
And

922
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
The match was never mentioned the game and highlights

923
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Anthem

924
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
2 years later I found myself

925
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
The first time in my life

926
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Falling in Love

927
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
This was the gun guy Richard

928
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Holler at the time was in college

929
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,367
It was a very positive feeling why didn't know whether it was one which I did Express

930
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
But I did

931
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Say so with my heart my mouth

932
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
And Richard

933
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,935
Clipped me by the shoulders and he said I know

934
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
He said but I'm not that way

935
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
But I love you in my own way

936
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
And

937
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:15,455
I was glad I have said that imply versus being received in such a warm February

938
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
I thought you might be friends for the rest of our

939
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Lives

940
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,623
But then one day he came into me since he didn't bother by finding

941
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Alarm

942
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
In his groin and he was worried

943
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Could I have a look at it

944
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,815
And I looked at it and I felt it

945
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
And it was hard and tethered

946
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
I turned out to be a

947
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
Tiki malignant

948
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Form of lymphedema

949
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Sarcoma

950
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
Anthem

951
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,919
He never spoke to me again often

952
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
I don't know whether

953
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
Since I gained the first to recognize the ominous

954
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Import

955
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Harbinger of death

956
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Messenger of death

957
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Whatever

958
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
But you you were left with the

959
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
With that silence

960
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Yep

961
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Few years later

962
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Allergy medicine man they mellings younger the Sailor

963
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,447
He liked Oliver he was into weightlifting they became close friends

964
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
And they began living together

965
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,567
I adored him and was in love with him and unloved

966
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
Physical contact

967
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,711
I need workout need Russell and ride motorcycles kind of tightly in

968
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,551
You never talked about what might or might not be happening between them but one day

969
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
They were together and Alder was giving Mel a back massage with smell.off and asked him to do

970
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
I love doing that

971
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,535
And Oliver says sometimes he get a little

972
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
You know

973
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,167
Excited and gave no indication it was okay

974
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,751
But but but one day things went a bit too far

975
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
And I got swatted

976
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,103
I went over the bridge just before the Big Bang

977
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
Metal immediate resource

978
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Don't happen

979
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
How to shower

980
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
Adam said I

981
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,039
I can't stay with you anymore

982
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
And then I found that

983
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Very

984
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
Cool and upset

985
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
That made me feel

986
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,303
I don't want to have anything to do with

987
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
People

988
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
I must have fallen in love

989
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,423
Kenosha lights with anyone

990
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Again

991
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,031
And he didn't share his life with anyone for a long long

992
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
In fact

993
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
He told me a story about something that happened

994
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Maybe 8 years ago

995
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,039
I and I was just joining the faculty

996
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Columbiana

997
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
I was having this one

998
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
An interview

999
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
And fun park

1000
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,487
The interviewer said to me she said I have something other private Law School

1001
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Would you like macejka

1002
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Fuel system too lean

1003
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Can I said no

1004
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
Pb2

1005
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Or my affairs

1006
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
And I did say

1007
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
Thinking she was going to ask me about

1008
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
I said I haven't had any sex

1009
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,847
35 Euros

1010
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
I bet that's what she was going to ask me my Social Security

1011
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,743
Tell the truth is Oliver didn't do anything about it because

1012
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,327
He didn't think he could I be chosen Richard lost Richard

1013
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
Chosen mail lost mail

1014
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,911
What's the point he was thinking and then

1015
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,495
Find Uno's waiting her why these things happen to people

1016
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,311
But a man came along who for the first time

1017
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Chose

1018
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Oliver

1019
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,735
I admit bilious I need the number of people because I've been changed

1020
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
A manuscript

1021
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,319
The book and then

1022
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,879
An intimacy grew between us

1023
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,695
I don't think I quite realized how deep it

1024
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,023
Pause button with a particular episode

1025
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
In Christmas

1026
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
All Pro 9

1027
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Meineke

1028
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Kmart

1029
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
And in his suit

1030
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Serious

1031
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,031
Way she has a serious calf of leg

1032
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
She said I

1033
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,615
I have conceived a deep love for you

1034
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
I have conceived

1035
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,319
I got a few extra words I have conceived

1036
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
Tumblr forgot

1037
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,439
Okay was he scared to say I love you

1038
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:15,839
You know she likes the English language

1039
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Camping food

1040
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,191
More cautiously and yet most lonely

1041
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
I think that's a beautiful way of putting it

1042
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
And then I realized

1043
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
At that moment with his

1044
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,383
Saying that

1045
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
But I had conceived

1046
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
A deep love

1047
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,551
And I

1048
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,111
Good God it happened again

1049
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
And I'm in my 77th year

1050
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
Arlington

1051
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,191
And what next and things

1052
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Basically have gone

1053
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,567
Happily ever since

1054
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:05,247
And surprisingly guiltlessly

1055
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,903
Because then again I'm not dealing with or what I'm dealing with a food

1056
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,255
I'm dealing with an individual

1057
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
I'm not dealing with a.m.

1058
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
With a condition defined by medicine

1059
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Hello

1060
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:30,335
So Oliver still doesn't know how much time he has left for the moment as you can hear

1061
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,711
His mind is totally in pacu still riding he has two books in addition to the one you find in the lobby

1062
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
Beat that is writing in the children's book

1063
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,623
Bunch of New Yorkers stories in last few months and a New York Review of Books story

1064
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,951
He's got energy to spare so I want to do one last thing for we close

1065
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:51,071
And this comes from yet another conversation I had with him it's a story I know Oliver wood Heat

1066
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,375
Because he's not a capital I religious

1067

00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,751
Who definitely Embraces mystery and for a long time

1069
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
He's been mystified by a color called

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Indigo

1071
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Indigo

1072
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919

1073
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
Between blue and violet

1074
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,551
I know no two people seem to agree is to what

1075
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,087
Indigo was like

1076
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
And

1077
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
