When you

When you get off

17
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Talking to the dump

00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
When you get off Minecraft

I think it's a different word

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Homophone

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
Homophone

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Strawberry ready for this

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
What are you about to get me ready. So this

34
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Just to put a

35
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
Iframe adjust off top my head frame

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
So

37
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Last year

38
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
We decided

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
To do a thing where I

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
We went to the inbox

41
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
What's the Radiolab inbox

42
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
4 years

43
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
People had been sending us

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Questions they want dance

45
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Stupid questions if we are calling them collect

46
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Wait we say that love

47
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Sometimes they would say

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
Question I don't know it may seem too simple.

49
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Why

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Do and then some

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
Sure thing, is the sky blue

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
I think so do a lot of these kind of question to accumulate in the inbox

53
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
Last year we took a bunch of those Quest

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
And we try to answer them

55
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
And it was very fun everyone got to do one and one pic

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Question and ran after it

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
And there were some questions left over there was also

58
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Questions that we ourselves

59
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
They were here.

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
It's like filed away in

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
And so

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
We decided we were going to do this

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Except this time

64
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Broadneck constraints so there's not just

65
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
Questions that are sent to us but we questions we ourselves had questions that were given to us by

66
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Friends of the show

67
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Came into our heads and never gone away

68
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Here's the deal

69
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,464
If you were wondering for your life reading a book talking to a friend browsing a magazine

70
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
And some question came up

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
But you thought

72
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,936
I don't know and it never left your head take that question the one you

73
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
Still think about never answered

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
An answer it

75
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Exactly

76
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,664
Yes right we have four questions in this episode and then I'll be another episode with a few more questions in a couple of days

77
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Starting us off and we have the levels all right

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Yeah

79
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
You sound pretty sure Simon Adler

80
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
Okay I'm looking at my checkbook while we're doing this

81
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
What what's going on in the checkbook at the moment

82
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
August

83
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Checking

84
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
And close relative

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
You sound great

86
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Very good

87
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
Soap for my question a little while back I give my dad

88
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Jim Adler and Simon's father

89
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
And your first time being on the show

90
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
That's correct

91
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Been on before with

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,808
Ponderable questions I wanted to bring back on because

93
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Since his last

94
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
It's an honored

95
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
I'll be back a little over a year ago

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
You could kind of say he's become a new man

97
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
All thanks

98
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
To a phone call

99
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Okay

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
It was June 25

101
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Okay and it was a gorgeous day

102
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Sunny day

103
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Good temperatures

104
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
And

105
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
I had decided about 1

106
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
In the afternoon

107
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
To take a walk

108
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,688
And as he was strolling along cross the River from our house

109
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
I felt my phone

110
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Vibrate in my pocket

111
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
And

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
I looked at it and saw that he had a voice

113
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
And it said

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Hi this message is for Kim

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,375
Are Timothy on this is Carrie calling from UW hospital in the transplant Department

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,775
Summer calling because we have an organ offer to discuss with you it said something to the effect of

117
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
We have a long

118
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Available a couple of numbers that you can call reserved for you

119
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Call back

120
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Now that the transplant coordinator

121
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
On-call pay something like that

122
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Wow

123
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,719
This this is hard to believe thank you

124
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
If I can back up here

125
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,423
Go back 25 years back my dad was diagnosed with sarcoidosis

126
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
It's a relatively rare disease with no cure

127
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Better Century triggers the immune system

128
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
To attack the body

129
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,919
Typically it it targets and wreaks havoc on the lungs

130
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
Usually sarcoidosis goes away on its own after a few years

131
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Hoping would happen if I dad

132
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
But in his case the disease became chronic

133
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
It's a beer after your breathing became harder and harder

134
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Can't stop running a marathon runner at the time and suddenly just walking a mile became difficult

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
10 years back he

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:35,615
Started using oxygen at album get around and then five years ago things finally got so bad

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
That he was

138
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
Place on waitlist for a lunch

139
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
Inside that call was the transplant team

140
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Calling him to say that

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
After five years of waiting they had

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Awarded this long to me

143
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
If I was still on board

144
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,095
Assembly was almost like you're a sweepstakes winner

145
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
What did you feel like a sweepstakes winner or you would like

146
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Well

147
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Ice I had to ask

148
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
That

149
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,687
I always said that if one was made available I would take

150
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
And it's going to make a great story

151
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
When it's all said and

152
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
I unlock back I called and I said we're in

153
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
And Damn the Torpedoes Full Speed Ahead

154
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
And from there this years-long glacial Pace process

155
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Started moving

156
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Very fast

157
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
It was pretty much honey pack your bag

158
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
My folks hop in the car drove the three and a half hours south of the hospital in Madison Wisconsin

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
About 5:30

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,295
You know within 45 minutes I was basically immobilized

161
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Because I had things coming out of every orifice

162
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
And then just a couple hours after that very early that next morning the surgeon came in and said

163
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
It's time

164
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
They just told me to relax

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
What's the next thing you remember

166
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Well

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
I woke up

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,087
And my arms were strapped to the gurney

169
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
And I had a breathing tube down my throat

170
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
And

171
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Yeah you just got hit by a bus

172
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Operation

173
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
That was the beginning

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
Now sitting in my dad's hospital room

175
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Is he was coming to

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
I really realized for the

177
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
The first time

178
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Then

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
That this was

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Like this wasn't over

181
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
The phrase

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Is

183
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
You're just a

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,903
Exchanging one major set of problems

185
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
For another's

186
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Majors that a problem

187
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
The biggest being the threat of rejection

188
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
In fact about 50% of folks

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
To get a lung transplant

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Only live about 5 years

191
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
And you can always be on the wrong side of that

192
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm sure that that had sort of been

193
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Explain to us

194
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
But I am

195
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
I didn't really

196
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Imagine what that meant

197
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Until

198
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
We saw him lying there

199
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
Sister said they weren't they were all these sort of terrifying question

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Surrounding

201
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
All of us

202
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
In

203
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
My

204
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
I think we wanted to find a way to talk about all the

205
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Terrifying

206
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Oceans without

207
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Having to ask

208
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Disgusting

209
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
And so

210
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
The way we

211
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Decided to talk about this was

212
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
We inserted this

213
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Intellectual or legal

214
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
The question was

215
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Who had

216
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Ownership of

217
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
This long

218
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Throughout the

219
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
This entire process

220
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Because like I don't know if they're transporting a

221
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Suitcase full of

222
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
Hundred dollar bills like somebody has to be responsible for that suitcase every step of the

223
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,999
Oregon is essentially

224
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Valued at

225
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Much is a suit

226
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
K400

227
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Dollar bills

228
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
So who the heck was responsible for and who owned it who is liable for a teacher

229
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Wager

230
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
When

231
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Did I

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
They have complete

233
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Ownership

234
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
I was alone

235
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
That was that was the Ulta

236
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Wait so you and your

237
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Are you just you and your

238
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Your mom and

239
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,623
Brother talking about the sources like are you talked about this with your dad

240
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Started between Barbara and

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Barber you're my partner from there that the circle of conversation group

242
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
As

243
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Search as the week went on

244
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
And eventually my dad was roped into it in my dad

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
Lawyers that he had some thoughts on all this

246
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,407
Yeah it's awake but isn't it kind of a simple matter I mean I would imagine that when the longest in the donor

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
But you know anything about the donor

248
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
We we don't know it's all

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Kept quite confidential

250
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,903
Essentially there's a process through which my dad is

251
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
Send a thank you note

252
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
Start of into a black box that is the

253
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Nonprofit

254
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Organ donation

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Machinery

256
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,703
And that will be delivered to them and then if they would like to reach back out to him they can do

257
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
But up until this

258
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Okay so getting back to it so

259
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
I would think that when the longest in the donor's body

260
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
It is in that person's possession then it taken out and then if that's

261
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
Intermediate stages in the hospital

262
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Possession is a trend

263
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,671
And then when it goes into your Dad's Body he then immediately assumes owners

264
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Simple as that

265
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
What you think so

266
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Right okay

267
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,143
Nothing that really looks simple ever is very simple at least when lawyers get involved

268
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
This is Fred now I'm afraid Kate I'm a professor of law at Indiana University Maurer School of Law keep the guy

269
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
I ultimately called to try to tease out an answer here

270
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Because he's written a lot on the laws surrounding

271
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
He said the first thing you got it

272
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
First of all property is a really special thing in the law

273
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Code of laws

274
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
Hammurabi in by Daddy means many of the oldest written laws we have as humans

275
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
We're about

276
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
Acting property historically protecting property was in a very much at the heart of it

277
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Set up to settle disputes over ownership

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
An enemy take away from him

279
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
Assess damages the broker shall be free of obligation

280
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
And overtime the number of things the law protects has only grown you know intangible things like

281
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Intellectual property you know I can own a copy right now and so we have a respect for property that's

282
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Reflected in the law

283
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
That is really quite distinctive

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,543
Okay but having said all of that we don't really allow property rights in most body parts

285
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
And moreover the law doesn't let us call the human body

286
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Property

287
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
Obviously in this country there was a time when it did

288
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
But then you have the 13th Amendment which ended slavery and since then have a squeamishness it could

289
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
To be a reaction to the

290
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
Prohibition on slavery that we don't want to ever give the notion that one person can own a another person's body

291
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Austin princess

292
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
US law has gone very silent

293
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
On questions of ownership and by

294
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
And so as a consequence

295
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
When someone donates you in Oregon

296
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
Legally you have no ownership claim over

297
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Back working we're just not willing to

298
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
SEPTA call it proper

299
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Okay

300
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
I think I get that strange then however

301
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Is that

302
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Apparently

303
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,743
That same provision applies to your own by

304
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Yeah you don't have property interested in your body and so although you can donate them and you can leave them

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
When your will we don't really treat them like

306
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Property

307
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
Wait so you're born with along in your body

308
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
You don't own that thing that's been with you since birth

309
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Correct it is yours but you don't own it

310
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,319
What are we quibbling over the word property here or ownership cuz rental lawyers do we

311
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
We we don't come equivalent this is what we

312
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Making money doing is arguing over property

313
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
If

314
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
It's not property what what is it what's the what's the term at that point

315
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
I don't think we really have a term for that

316
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Now

317
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Near me

318
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,287
When I relayed this to my dad don't own your own

319
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Oregon

320
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Yeah

321
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
She was as

322
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Confused design

323
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
At the risk of a pond made

324
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Certainly carved out

325
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Interesting

326
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Concept

327
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,695
And it turns out the consequences of this legal carve-out are

328
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Spectacularly spray

329
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
Let's say you drew a little bit of blood out of your arm one evening

330
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
I don't know why and you

331
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
You put it in a vial in your refrigerator and that night

332
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
A burglar breaks into your

333
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Your home your apartment goes into the refrigerator

334
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
And steals app

335
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
That that

336
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Thief would not be charged

337
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
With that

338
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,503
For for stealing that but there might be criminal claims like breaking and entering

339
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,343
But I just don't think it's going to be a property claim there because they didn't actually

340
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Steel

341
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Something that was your possession

342
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Equally strange

343
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
This is come up a couple times where

344
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
His wife John Elway husband in this case a guy by the name of Richard Batista

345
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Donated kidney to his

346
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
My priority was to save her life operation

347
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Well

348
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
To save

349
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
True love

350
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
But then says his wife began having an affair about 2 years after the trans

351
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,551
The marriage falls apart

352
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
Enter divorce proceedings uibe so stunning demand husband Bautista

353
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Bat once the kidney

354
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Shut up

355
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
True story and of course

356
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Was thrown out by the judge

357
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
In part because of

358
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
But also because

359
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,287
In the judge never said this but he could have it like sorry bub you never owned your your kidney to begin with

360
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
Let alone after you donated it

361
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
To your wife

362
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,455
So I don't think you would ever find a situation where that would be treated as marital property

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,807
But ironically and this is just going to make it even more complicated

364
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Blood skin and corny is tend to be an exception in the way we think about this in the law meaning

365
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
That you can sell your blood or or your skin the law allows that don't ask why that's just the way it is

366
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
Even still in these cases

367
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
This cannot call it

368
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Property

369
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
I don't

370
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
Own it but I could sell it exactly

371
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
What did they eat when they took that blood

372
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
I would assume that they don't own it either well the purchaser

373
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,039
The folks who do buy it from you the blood bank the hospital that is that have collected it

374
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
They own

375
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,647
Here's the kicker

376
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
So if you then broke into the blood bank

377
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Steal back your own blood

378
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
You could be charged with

379
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Right we have cases on this

380
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Okay that's definite

381
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Marriott

382
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
All right

383
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Well

384
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
What I think is interesting here is

385
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Like I think we we first

386
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Started wondering this Quest

387
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
As a as a tangible way

388
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
2

389
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Think about this

390
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Barb

391
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
More abstract

392
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
Impossible to answer question which was like

393
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
When would we feel like

394
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
This long was really yours like when would we

395
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
Feel like we didn't have to be worrying

396
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Right

397
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
I don't know I guess that I'm not

398
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
I'm not fully there yet

399
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Oh

400
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Are you

401
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Well

402
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Three months ago I received it

403
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Call from

404
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Nearest it's been handling

405
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
All of our

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Transplant

407
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Fairs

408
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
And and

409
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
She just almost there

410
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
As an aside sets

411
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
I think you're going to

412
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Stick around a long time with the

413
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
It's long because it's going so well

414
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
And I I didn't know what

415
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
She was talking to

416
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
It first and then she went on to explain that

417
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
Autism mortality rate after 5 years yeah

418
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
50%

419
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
The nun

420
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
It's me

421
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
But I don't

422
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
I think you have to worry about that

423
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
I think you're going to be one of our 30 year candidate

424
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Well I never I never seen

425
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,743
Consider a 30-year planning anything I've always lived on it

426
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
Five year plan

427
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Because

428
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
When I was

429
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
45

430
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Given that

431
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Decline of

432
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Pulmonary function

433
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
I said

434
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
To myself I am going to be lucky

435
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
I'm going to be the luckiest man in the world if I could

436
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
60

437
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,527
In order to get 260 I had to get 250 and then 255

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,879
And then at age 60 when I got listed or thereabouts

439
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
You know then

440
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
On A Five-Year Plan where no longer came along

441
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
So they've always lived

442
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
In these five your gaps

443
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
And have been happy to reach

444
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Those

445
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,543
So anyway it was I was dumbfounded and it was pretty

446
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Awe-inspiring

447
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Here's always turn

448
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Right then and there I said that

449
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
This is it this is what this is all about

450
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
It's working

451
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
This long

452
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
And

453
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
It's mine

454
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
I'm really happy

455
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
And for us I am happy for us

456
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Aqi

457
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Pretty please myself

458
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Good

459
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Producer Simon Adler

460
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271

461
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
I'm listening to that I sent to Simon

462
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Don't want

463
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
What does

464
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
This story

465
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Doesn't have

466
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,423
Cowboy

467
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Merchant of Venice

468
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
I think

469
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Is it really

470
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
My birthday

471
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895

472
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Antonio

473
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Pound of Flesh

474
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Sure

475
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
And then he doesn't pay back

476
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Social activist

477
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
The court and says

478
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
I want

479
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Pound

480
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Flesh pound

481
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Pound a pound

482
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
I wanted to run away but I will kill this guy

483
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Lisa that's the deal he signed

484
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
Iona pound of Flesh from this man

485
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
I mean Tire play then turns

486
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
On a court case

487
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
No way

488
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
What will happen

489
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
He wins

490
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
He gets his pound of Flesh

491
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Well it's a

492
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Trick ending

493
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
He wins

494
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
And then the judge says of course

495
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
You can have the pound of Flesh

496
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
The contract did not include any blood

497
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
So

498
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
No blood

499
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
See if you can get the pound of flesh but if any blood of Antonio comes

500
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
Your way you have

501
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Violated the criminal laws event

502
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
You can have a pound of bloodless flesh there is no sex

503
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
Think so he's

504
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Hot

505
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Some twisted

506
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
I just hit this

507
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Looks like you've been productive this is

508
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Has been fought about face

509
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Really smart people before this

510
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,767
What is what's going to number the second big little question this one

511
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
So to you by our producer Becca breast

512
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Hello

00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Did I tell you anything about what I want

514
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,567
I am talking to you about my question comes from the sky Jason Pfeiffer

515
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Okay I'm recording now

516
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
Is that always how you test your mic

517
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
This is Jason

518
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
The hosts podcast I really like called pessimist archive

519
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,623
Is little too hard to explain right now but it's really great you should go check it out

520
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,976
Anyways I reached out to him I just sent him an email and I

521
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,096
And you know I'm a fan of your podcast you seem like a really interesting guy I imagine you have some

522
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Fairly interesting question so

523
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,984
What keeps you up at night what burning questions do you have that maybe I can help you answer

524
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
All right

525
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,080
So you won't get a shot your question

526
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Okay so here we go

527
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
So

528
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Okay so here's my question

529
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,088
How far by myself out cuz it's such a complicated question

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
Are we going to start

531
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
I do have a question

532
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Okay

533
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
So here's my question why question is

534
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
How far back in time

535
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Could I go

536
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
And say a word that

537
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,216
You are like an English word a word that means whatever it means to me in English

538
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
That

539
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
No I didn't do it yet

540
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,712
Hard Rihanna so hard I know I can't even write this in an email so that it was communicated to you

541
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
I don't know

542
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
Okay so here's my here's my question

543
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
If I could walk

544
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,696
Into Bill and Ted's time machine and go back as far as possible

545
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
Step out and say a word in English

546
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
What word could I say

547
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,704
That the person whose hearing they would understand exactly what it means because the same

548
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Sounded meaning

549
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Have been retained across time

550
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,152
What is the oldest word that I can say in English that the

551
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Possible person from

552
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,040
Totally different Ivan culture like they would think I'd say the word and they be like

553
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Yes I understand you don't know how they would respond cuz I don't know their language but they would they would know what I'm saying

554
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Know what I'm saying

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
How what is that word

556
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Does that make sense

557
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,376
Yeah I think that's it I think it's great

558
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,984
What an odd question what is the oldest English word

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
It hasn't changed

560
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
Yeah and I asked Jason do you have a guess

561
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Oh

562
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,664
He was like maybe something basic tree

563
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
Like something just Elemento

564
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Grass

565
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Dirt

566
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Water

567
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
That's

568
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Probably where it would go

569
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
So

570
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
I

571
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
Just started calling around hello

572
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
Sara Sara hello

573
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
1st percentile

574
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Westerra

575
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
Thomas and professor of linguistics at the University of Michigan and she told me I can get you six thousand years back

576
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
4000 BC

577
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
Which is when you have this language known as

578
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Proto-indo-european

579
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
Pro 200 European

580
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
FB

581
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,856
Ultimate ancestor of English and all its relatives are known as Indo-European languages

582
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
So proto-indo-european is like the great great great grandparent of Greek German

583
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,096
Dutch most languages in India all over the world

584
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,192
Colonization by the way

585
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
The Proto Indo Europeans

586
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
So we talking about like

587
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,920
Tribal Forest people from in the people in Eastern Europe near the Black

588
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:23,552
Sort of fisherman little bit of hunting

589
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
And

590
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,160
So how long was this against 6000 years

591
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
And I think my best guess

592
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
Forward that would have been understood way back then

593
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
Is

594
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
The word is

595
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
And why did she think that was the oldest one

596
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
So the way that you thinking about it was

597
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
Certain

598
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,080
Consonants like T&K or 6000 years changed a lot

599
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
But ass

600
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Didn't change very much

601
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Underground

602
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
But they're told me that the way you would have pronounced is

603
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Is

604
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
St

605
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
At the end that's not to say it's not the same I know I know it's not the same so I kept calling

606
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Around

607
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:09,888
Describe on another linguists and I work on language change and language documentation

608
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
My question and she was like okay

609
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
How about the word for me

610
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Me

611
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Yep

612
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
Simple it's Elemental and turned off that 6000 years ago me

613
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,344
I know I know

614
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,952
Next up was Robert Robert can you hear me Robert

615
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
Toronto

616
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,840
Yes I can hear you now

617
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
Sack you know completely hold things in

618
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Stock

619
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
Call them another guy you might just introducing yourself

620
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Chicago

621
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Love you

622
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
Words that really have not changed that much

623
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
So the English word

624
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
3

625
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,952
6 eat an apple into what would those like

626
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,584
Proto-indo-european pronunciation speed

627
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Estrellas

628
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
+ 6

629
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Is swac

630
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
Apple is horrible

631
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
Eat is Ed

632
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
No none of that

633
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
Yeah well maybe the answer is there is no word to survive so they're just going to get as close as they can

634
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,784
Answer your question exactly but I can get under the

635
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
Under the cloud that covers the subject switches

636
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,256
Super satisfying right I mean like why what I want isn't it as a very precise

637
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
You know

638
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
Literally the exact same word

639
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
And so I thought like well maybe I can't go back to 6

640
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
Thousand years I can go back

641
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
600

642
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,568
Something and so how's it going

643
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
I got in touch with this guy Andrew rate

644
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,760
Professor of English at the University of Louisville

645
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Period in England

646
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
Pretty much between 500

647
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
In 1066

648
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:13,280
Very modern now okay what's what's the word

649
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
Word must be an Old English word

650
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,216
So much of our language obviously comes from Old English words

651
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Percent or so

652
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
Come to us directly from molding

653
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
It has to be holding

654
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Thinking

655
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
What if

656
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,040
Not what if it were something all the way back with

657
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,880
Proto-indo-european

658
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,720
Cuz Andrew went about this a different way

659
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
Keith Wade Andrew was thinking about this

660
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Is he was looking for an English word

661
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Sounds

662
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,680
The same or really similar in a

663
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
Bunch of other Indo-European languages

664
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
Cuz if you could find that word that was shared among these languages

665
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,896
That it would it would mean that they were all holding on to

666
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Something

667
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
From Proto Indo European European languages together

668
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
More words for father

669
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Dough Latin

670
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Has popped air

671
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
Old English has father North Bossier

672
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
German boxer

673
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,656
And then you also realize that mother in German

674
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,984
Masters polish the same way

675
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,384
So he went to his dictionary of proto-indo-european and he's looked up father and mother and they're not quite the same

676
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Mother is

677
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,224
Something like mother and father is

678
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Something like

679
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,368
But we did find is at in the dictionary right under the words mother and father

680
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Ready to other words

681
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Mama

682
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
And Papa

683
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,024
Mama and Papa Mama and Papa

684
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Mama and Papa

685
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
So yeah if we almost almost certainly if we went back to Eastern

686
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
Millennium BCE and we said

687
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Mama

688
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Or Papa

689
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
They would have understood

690
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
That's just a little

691
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
Who

692
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
God are you raining on my mind

693
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Of course

694
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,208
Why do I think about myself of course it would be sure it's like babies

695
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
First words

696
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
The thing that did surprise me that I thought was really cool and talking to Andrew is that the words Mama and Papa

697
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
In virtually

698
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
Every

699
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Language

700
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
So obviously all the languages that come from Proto into your

701
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
Mama in Norwegian

702
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Mama in Italian

703
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Papa's

704
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,200
Or apus grandfather

705
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:44,832
But also the more sound patterns in Chinese

706
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,160
Amma and APPA like it's not just Indo-European language

707
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
The sound show up in

708
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,304
Swahili in Eskimo and Hebrew Arabic

709
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
The linguistic Universal

710
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
They just go right across the board

711
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,704
She just came up with an answer that's I get for everybody

712
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,776
Yeah you find me sounds in a vast majority of languages

713
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:09,664
And why is that because you said that no one's really quite sure but maybe the

714
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
The

715
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
M sound because it only involves the lips

716
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
The vocal cords

717
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Papa's

718
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
The sound

719
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
I was just to take away easy for babies

720
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
It's been gif

721
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Perhaps

722
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
The whip movie

723
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Involved in Fang

724
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Mama

725
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Similar to lip movement

726
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Involved in

727
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Latching onto a woman's breast

728
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
Ultimately we don't really know

729
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Why release the babies know what they're not telling

730
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
But you know what

731
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
The very fact

732
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,152
First words we learn to say as babies

733
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
The oldest word

734
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Potential really lovely thought

735
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Oh

736
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
Call json to tell him what I learned

737
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
That

738
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
Is that where they come from

739
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
Are we saying mama and papa because desert sounds babies can make yes the easiest sounds I can make ya exactly that's awesome

740
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
That's really awesome

741
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
You know what

742
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
What's a cool is that I

743
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,616
Was thinking at first about basics

744
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,944
Trees and stuff but this is this but actually that wasn't

745
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Basically

746
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
The most basic thing is the

747
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,112
First relationship that you can understand

748
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
And the first sound that you can make about it

749
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
That's the most basic cats

Becca Bressler

751
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
What's funny is that

752
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
Most the time I feel like dad comes first

753
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
For some reason

754
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
Shouldn't

755
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,552
Why no man it's always a great it's always like this classic moment

756
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
The fence with moms like

757
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
What

758
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,952
First

759
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,816
We said she was like okay you're going to go to him first

760
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,656
Not the person who birthed you and who is feeding you

761
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
I look to you for the cheapest price like he doesn't know what he's saying

762
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
Let's go to break

763
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688

Yes let's shall

765
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Let's

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

773
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
And I'm here because I need your help

774
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
This summer

775
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
And I request

776
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
For those of you who

777
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
You spend a lot of time with kids parents

778
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling

779
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Tiny moments of brilliance

780
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,256
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

781
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
It just means you bring back and say

782
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
Maybe it was the moment that I

783
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

784
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Or maybe the kid was a piano

785
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,896
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

786
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:25,760
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

787
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
We're interested in the

788
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Epic moments where

789
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,904
Kid does something super smart

790
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

791
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
If you have a story

792
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256

798
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Thank you so much

799
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
Hey ready 3-2-1 hey I'm Jared Polis Radiolab is what we're doing yes and we are in

800
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:10,304
The midst of big little question part three friends and family Edition and

801
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,704
Yeah we said at the beginning that we're going to give we're going to we're going to nod to the questions we can't get out of our heads

802
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
And it may be a little bit and

803
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Right

804
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
And if you said that last part

805
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
The beginning

806
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
And

807
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Did this next one satisfies both

808
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
Of those criteria it comes from producer Annie

809
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,784
We came and she delivered it

810
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
2 producer Matt kielty

811
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
Are you recording yourself right now

812
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
No yeah I don't know I guess

813
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Maybe we could start by

814
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
How would you feel if I

815
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Called you a neanderthal

816
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
I would feel

817
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Like a

818
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Dummy

819
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Dum dum yeah

820
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Feels like something you said to me

821
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Big dumb men

822
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
And then so if I see the word Neanderthal what do you visualize

823
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Like a bigger

824
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Had like a big block head

825
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
A really big barrel

826
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Chest

827
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
And what is that

828
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
What is the per

829
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Person doing

830
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Punching stuff

831
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,024
What country

832
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,632
Anything around I think the image that comes to mind is something Harrier

833
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Club

834
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Hunched over

835
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Prudish

836
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,032
This is Evelyn Jugo de IMAP

Blind in Harvard

838
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
Human evolutionary biology Department

839
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,712
Unlike most people you know researching a topic she's got a Google alert

840
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Set up for the word neanderthal

841
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
About half

842
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
The time it's an actual size story about neanderthals and the other half of the time

843
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
Absolutely Andrew Saul on trefoil using the word Neanderthal to me in

844
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Finance referred to her

845
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Eyes and I quote

846
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,264
A neanderthal make me angry

847
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
Evelyn says his image of Neanderthals is just

848
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Just not quite

849
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
It needs an update

850
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,296
Yes I remember you saying last we spoke on the phone kind of the way that we think about Android

851
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Did you say Saul or tall

852
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
I honestly can never decide what I say

853
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,584
I think so but I feel like a bit of a weiner when I say meander

854
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,448
I feel like such a

855
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
OK Google when do the wrong image

856
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Stuck in a brain

857
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,848
Yeah so it got that her brains about

858
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:37,248
100 years ago in France with this guy named Marshall on bull use a payload paleoanthropologist

859
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,344
And when he was in his lab in Paris

860
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
And he was brought

861
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
This

862
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,488
This at the time with most complete

863
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
NFL skeleton ever found

864
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,120
Which is very exciting and so we took a look at the skeleton and what he sees is

865
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Something small something

866
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Curled over

867
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Hunched

868
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Decrepit

869
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,896
Any interpreter set insert a famous drawing based off his interpretation turns out to look like this

870
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Hunched-over 8-man

871
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,528
That is where we get our ideas about one skeleton then

872
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
Became

873
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
What we now think of today

874
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
Colloquially as what Indian Palace

875
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
But

876
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,328
It turned out that this particular skeleton actually had regular arthritis

877
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
Skeleton

878
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Oh but you just thought that's the way it was

879
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Exactly yeah it's like an alien species coming and finding the

880
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
The skeleton they find that represents Humanities

881
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:42,784
85 year old woman in a wheelchair something like everybody looks like this

882
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,928
And it's so tell me a little bit about what do we know about neanderthals now what are the things that are

883
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
We are learning

884
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
How are they evolving in our mine

885
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,864
I would say that going from that brutish woolly mammoth

886
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Primitive Neanderthal picture

887
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Okay a lot of Sciences

888
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Today

889
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,568
Have more of a sense of esl as a different flavor of you

890
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Bring me to my question

891
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:15,040
Hey so so a few months back and I we were making this

892
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
Story about using help his leader

893
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,648
Speed hybrid polar bear grizzly bears

894
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
You were there

895
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,024
And while we were hanging out in studio

896
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
I thought that two different I was trying to explain to you just how far apart evolutionarily

897
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,824
These grizzly bears and polar bears are evolutionarily like hundreds of thousands of years ago

898
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,224
Pretty much the same time that we broke off from the Neanderthals and so be like us meeting a neanderthal

899
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
Odin the you know is the Crown Heights bar or something

900
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,392
Going home a person and creating

901
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:58,048
It's really specific it sounds like you had

902
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,376
Franklin Ave April 10th

903
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
Show me the kind of dumb joke it is very silly

904
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:14,176
The question kind of stuck around my mind at the Lutheran like wheat what would that be like as a funny image meeting NFL in a bar

905
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,784
Relate to each other what would we do we have anything, are we at all

906
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,880
Tools that you question like if you met of the installer bar what would it be like

907
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
Yeah like could we communicate

908
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
What would it sound like

909
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Ha

910
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
This is why I originally called Evelyn chicken

911
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Okay

912
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
Help me imagine

913
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,192
And we can be suspected of here so you're free to step out of here I like

914
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,592
Scientist hiding from your artists hat or whatever you want to do

915
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,944
I was even today I was even put that part and I will see I will

916
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
Okay

917
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
You want to tell me you would have said the same okay

918
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
So where are you

919
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
Okay let's just say I'm at

920
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
A

921
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Jazz

922
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Club

923
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,744
Cool the lights really dim

924
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
The music is kind of like that likes

925
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,144
Amy Rush on the symbols type of bags

926
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,032
Maybe it's raining outside or just finished raining and I'm shaking my umbrella

927
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,152
And I look around and I see you at service scattering of homo sapiens

928
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,784
Summer summer playing pool

929
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,856
Tell me why are we living in reality

930
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,720
Sometimes it's homo sapiens and sometimes your standard fellows or is this just how you be a special night

931
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
I'm looking around at all the people and interests

932
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,728
On this one guy

933
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Fairly robust

934
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
He's got red hair red hair red hair brown hair and most of it was on their head

935
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
So they didn't really have much more body hair than

936
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,368
The implication of that is that you must have had fire

937
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,256
Are you playing it cool or you or you just like gawking what are you doing how close are you

938
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,608
I don't like Sidle up to him and and then slip into the the stool next to him

939
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
You notice

940
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
His Highness

941
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
The back is

942
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Treating out

943
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Got a pretty big nose

944
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
Smallest chin

945
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Brown eyes

946
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Katie is working on

947
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Riding up

948
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,784
Medicinal plant

949
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
It's been a long day

950
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,208
Evelyn says that there's no evidence that neanderthals use plants

951
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
To make medicine

952
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
For more incredibly they also like

953
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
After their sick in their elderly

954
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,704
The good people I know you got to get home to care for his grandma

955
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,056
You're captivated you like this is something different but

956
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Familiar

957
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:56,735
You don't realize it's nobody guess that's just how short he is completely by

958
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,831
I'm like oh my gosh

959
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
We are aware in my question

960
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
We're just looking at each other

961
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,303
And I just wonder what's the next step

962
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
Any talk could neanderthals talk

963
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
This is one of the great debates about whether it is Alzheimer's

964
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
We don't technically know if they could

965
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,383
Talk but it's really hard to tell just by looking at their DNA and their skeletal remains

966
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
But

967
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
There's the check out all this stuff

968
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
Evelyn says that they had a variety of

969
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,671
They're able to hunt mammoths Robin ball game art yes like

970
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Geometric

971
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Keep getting

972
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,535
And furthermore the other things that there's

973
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,863
Evidence of dance on Saturday

974
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,191
And you think like with all those things

975
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,799
How could they have done it without communication they just make me think they had language

976
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Yeah

977
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
Yeah it makes me think that too

978
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Okay so if they could talk

979
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
What would that sound like

980
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,575
What would this guy at the bar what would his voice

981
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Oh goodness that some

982
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Hesperian

983
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
This is a human

984
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
This is a human throat

985
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
This is a neanderthal

986
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
BBC documentary

987
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
Made back in 2005 where they tried to answer the

988
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:23,519
The question so I imagine that they wouldn't have Shuffle sound it would be loud very loud

989
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,591
Very very loud vocal coach and she is

990
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:32,735
Third of interpreting all the things that they then knew about neanderthals bigger head bigger nasal cavity

991
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
Chest and then getting dressed

992
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Into an actor

993
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
So this voice is it create

994
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Bring it back

995
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
Into my barsi

996
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
And imagine my Asus neanderthal

997
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
I have your number

998
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,631
According to BBC his response would have sounded something like this

999
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
No

1000
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Speak

1001
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Now let's make

1002
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Make a sound

1003
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Huge

1004
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:10,367
Again is it that that was the voice that came up with base in the science

1005
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,511
But you know I got like 14 years of past in a probably decides his updated

1006
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
What is

1007
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,887
What is the better answer that question today what is a more up-to-date version of this voice

1008
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,703
Dr. Barney are you there

1009
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
So I called up dr. Anna Barney

1010
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,175
Institute of sound and vibration research in University of Southampton

1011
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
Does question partly by focusing on this

1012
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Tiny little u-shaped

1013
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
The tongue

1014
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
And anybody who reads

1015
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Murder mysteries will know that because it's the one that

1016
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
Tax when you strangle so sweet baby.

1017
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,607
Sodus bone is a very important little bone for me

1018
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Sounds

1019
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
A neanderthal skeleton

1020
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Habitue

1021
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
But it hasn't really been clearly

1022
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Exactly how they used it

1023
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
Did they use it in the same way we do

1024
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
So doctor Bernie's team using computer modeling they sort of did a bunch of things to figure out where the hyoid bone probably sad

1025
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
In the neck of a neanderthal

1026
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
Escape is a slightly different shape of vocal tract

1027
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,415
Turn human

1028
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
Digitally push something like

1029
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Rest through it

1030
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Puffs of wind

1031
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
What sounds were you going for

1032
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
We were interested in water

1033
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
Kodachrome sold out

1034
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:32,799
And then those are the ones if you can produce those then you've got the range of sounds that the mobile human can make income

1035
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,615
The primary colors of

1036
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
The basis of

1037
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,503
Speeches that right that's right yes you could think of some assessment and Atticus to this primary

1038
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,087
So the idea is if they could say these three vowels

1039
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
It would have been physically tape

1040
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Full of some kind of language

1041
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
Which structure is okay and what

1042
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,583
Did you find a note we found a very good match

1043
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
It sounds a bit

1044
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Stole compared

1045
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
2

1046
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
The most inhuman

1047
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
What does it sound like

1048
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
A bit more like

1049
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Their ass be

1050
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
Become Oz

1051
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
Yeah so they still screaming yelling like the thing in the BBC

1052
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,599
What would a saint about that she said based on what we know now there's no real evidence

1053
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,719
That account see why they wouldn't have the whole range of being able to whisper and being able to shout

1054
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,167
I feel like Neanderthal women

1055
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:36,287
Just like excluded from the depiction of true

1056
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
There were Neanderthals live in

1057
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,527
Wow okay maybe I should have maybe I should meet an ESL women across the bar

1058
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
That's my kind of story

1059
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Okay so let's return to our nyanners

1060
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
It's over this time

1061
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
Inside of a man

1062
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
All right

1063
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,583
It's 100 Fun character switch

1064
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:04,703
And like the BBC 14 years ago I bought a new voice actor

1065
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
Sandra Clark

1066
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
To be my Neanderthal how tall are you

1067
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Perfect

1068
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
Beforehand that actually Workshop it's a couple

1069
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Of

1070
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
In a bar appropriate phrases

1071
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,087
I guess you could say with Anna Barney the sounds

1072
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
Like what could we have this man

1073
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
I was thinking like

1074
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Hello you are beautiful or

1075
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,375
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven that kind of thing

1076
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,191
Buttchin kind of a different idea and you gave me this one

1077
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,055
So weird but it really does highlight that special vowels

1078
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Patience

1079
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
Nugget so I'm standing next to this

1080
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Women

1081
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
They just imagine the sister of the other

1082
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,855
She's got brown hair

1083
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
The same piercing brown eyes

1084
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
And I just say

1085
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Hey

1086
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
And she pauses for ammo

1087
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
And then she says

1088
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
The cart

1089
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Thought

1090
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
On the mall

1091
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
The cat sat on the map

1092
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,615
Pink sheep

1093
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:21,503
There's back there's vowels in it you got your vowels

1094
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
Kind of lean in you know it's mysterious

1095
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
So

1096
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Come here often

1097
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Yes

1098
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
I'm Annie

1099
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
That's right my name that's my name

1100
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
Can I have your number

1101
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Can I have yours

1102
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Yeah

1103
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
It's one two three

1104
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
Revere Aires

1105
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,431
I'm picking you up at school

1106
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
No face looks

1107
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
So it's not too dramatic this

1108
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Which I think is itself dramatic

1109
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,719
No I just think it's so totally amazing how similar their

1110
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,583
The more and more we learn about them the closer and closer they become to being

1111
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
Very close cousins

1112
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
The caught

1113
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Thought

1114
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,751
On the mall not only a close cousin or actually a part of us

1115
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
For a lot of things

1116
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,663
For a lot of us we have a 2% Neanderthal DNA

1117
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
Init

1118
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
When I spoke to another scientist

1119
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,391
Asking all these scientist what would it be like to meet and yes I want a bar

1120
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
She actually had this.

1121
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,191
All around today because if we each carry about 2%

1122
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
I'm leaving.

1123
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:50,335
Especially when you consider

1124
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
So actually a monkey

1125
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
She was living today

1126
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:59,551
We have that I'm guessing it's very right now but

1127
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
70%

1128
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
Beijing, Japan

1129
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Living today

1130
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,719
What is she saying if you take all the 2%

1131
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Very very

1132
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
Individual humans and Adam monkey get to 70

1133
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,863
What does 70% of a neanderthal walking Among Us

1134
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,655
The ghost of Neanderthal

1135
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,215
That is cool

1136
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
So when you say you know what would happen if you met in the answer my boss today is kind of Misfits of an ant

1137
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:28,223
Bowling balls

1138
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,607
Alright Andy call me

1139
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
The caught thought

1140
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:57,407
On the mall

1141
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
Pre-screening McEwen

1142
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:06,623
Oh boy so Indiana calls reading dr. Seuss

1143
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:13,023
Strangle

1144
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,607
I sentence you to reading the Cat in the Hat

1145
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,263
They will be like in the NFL present

1146
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,567
Truly good

1147
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
Shelby round things out

1148
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
One more

1149
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,175
One more big little questions yes we should

1150
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
Go to the Final Cut

1151
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
This

1152
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,783
Final question

1153
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,927
Yes it comes from our gang like the other ones but this one just is so

1154
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Wonderful

1155
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,303
Weird Siri quality this one so if this time it won't be I want to dedicate

1156
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
What's about to happen

1157
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,423
2 people who are living in New York when I was growing up named mr. and mrs. purple

1158
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
Are these people who just drove on a purple bicycle dress

1159
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,823
Can only purple and lavender tie dye clothing

1160
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Had purple colored hair

1161
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
Purple Panda

1162
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Panda makeup

1163
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
And they were just

1164
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
Very purple and they were always

1165
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,319
Here there New York and they became a kind of legendary

1166
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,367
Free prints free prints

1167
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
And I'm sorry

1168
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
Sicknesses purple

1169
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Right now

1170
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
Heaven

1171
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
But there

1172
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,071
Heaven might very well be perfectly described

1173
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Bible Church

1174
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
Interesting

1175
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Pinterest

1176
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,239
Okay so me let me set it up so this is this comes from producer Rachel Cusick

1177
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,567
Rachel in addition to making radio with us

1178
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
Formerly was a professional maker of food

1179
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
Xi'an

1180
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
She worked in a she worked in a restaurant for 2 years

1181
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
I would call her a professional cook

1182
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
Although Apparently that is

1183
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Maybe putting a

1184
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Strongly

1185
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
Queen Rachel but she's a food wizard

1186
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,743
Regularly every couple of weeks

1187
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
We'll bring in these like

1188
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,351
Food inventions that she makes

1189
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
In the wee hours of the night

1190
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,471
Like a hallucinogenic lees colored rainbow

1191
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
Shortbread cookie things

1192
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
Incredibly delicious

1193
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,359
But also incredibly weird

1194
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
That will set you up for what's about to happen

1195
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
For sure

1196
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,479
Yes so she ran into this question that

1197
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
I guess you could say

1198
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
Combines all of that

1199
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
And throws in a bit of science as well as science meets food meets journalism like intersection that I'll

1200
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
Yeah this is my wheelhouse

1201
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Customer begins with this guy

1202
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
How are you doing

1203
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,959
Hi how's it going with excellent but can I ask you to introduce yourself so I'm under Sandberg

1204
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:33,311
I'm a senior research fellow at the Oxford Martin school at

1205
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,103
University of Oxford

1206
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,455
So I guess to start I was wondering if you could tell me how you first

1207
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
Stumbled across this

1208
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,319
Set the scene for me where were you what were you doing well

1209
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
That was going back to my office in Oxford

1210
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Use on a bus

1211
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Coming back from a meeting

1212
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:58,655
It's summer it's warmer than the I'm tinkering with my laptop because the counter side is pretty boring

1213
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,823
So deserving around do they like Wi-Fi on buses

1214
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
So dedicated that

1215
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
He brings his own form of

1216
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
Anyhow

1217
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
Who's on the bus

1218
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,575
And she starts answering questions from this website called stack

1219
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,111
Exchange

1220
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,159
It's it's I think of it like Yahoo answers

1221
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,767
But for like science nerds where people post questions summer science related

1222
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
And then anyone can come in answer

1223
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
Who are these people are these all smart like atomizer and no I think it's kind of like teenagers who want help with homework and then there's

1224
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,263
They're just random Joe schmoes who like are taking a break

1225
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
Reddit and they're like let me

1226
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
Show you how I can

1227
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
China right now

1228
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,407
And then there's Anders

1229
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
Scrolling

1230
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:48,319
Baby looking out the window every now and then and then he like that a certain point on the ride

1231
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Cease

1232
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
Bizquest

1233
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,951
What if Earth turn into blueberries

1234
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
It was probably just like that like what if the Earth turned into blueberries

1235
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
More or less

1236
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,399
Golf courses

1237
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,495
Blueberries Robert I'm already compressed blueberries

1238
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
In other words

1239
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,359
Take this Earth We're living on replace that dirt and water and rock within Earth's

1240
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,407
Size ball pit of blueberries

1241
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
What would that look like

1242
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
What

1243
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
Why would someone

1244
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
That quiz

1245
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:25,951
I want to I want to take a moment right now because I think I would not ask that question

1246
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,167
Also the kind of person who just needs to be convinced why is this an amazing Quest

1247
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,519
Hardcore science is on this website next to sirius science

1248
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Questions

1249
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:45,407
But it's also like the most Fantastical form of that it's like let me work within this

1250
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Structured world

1251
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
Like a lot of physics

1252
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
Planetary science and see where we can

1253
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,111
I love what this question I'm a big fan of

1254
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
Taking some assumptions it where does it live

1255
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,231
So Ender says the moment he saw that question pop up

1256
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
I can totally see how one can answer is

1257
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
But as soon as enters got started

1258
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:10,495
That the people over at stack exchange the moderators close the question because

1259
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
Apparently they thought it was too stupid

1260
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,639
When the moderators on Stock Exchange that took down the question Michael's really angry

1261
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Why

1262
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:23,551
Wait tell me why you was doing this is a good question because it allows us to exercise

1263
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
He's not even a physical ability

1264
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
I'm an amateur

1265
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,279
He's just like look I'm not even in this world but like these formulas are out there for everyone to use this is like why we have laws

1266
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
The physics is so that we can imagine

1267
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
These new world

1268
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Tom Waits

1269
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
Angelby

1270
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,775
Anna

1271
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,079
That's actually why I wrote the paper

1272
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:50,943
Array technical paper about the physics of it how

1273
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,735
Behave what it would look like what it was

1274
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
You like

1275
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,623
Can you walk me through just so I have an image in my mind I'm on this blueberry Earth

1276
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
What's the first thing that I would notice

1277
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
What you would feel like

1278
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,095
All right this morning

1279
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Why is that

1280
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,519
Well results show that the density of afterlife in the temperature range between 303 and 353

1281
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,407
Ender says if you calculate the density of uncompressed blueberries are about 700 kilos

1282
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
A cubic meter

1283
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,831
They got plugged into another formula to calculate how much less Mass with blueberry or have

1284
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,647
I'm from / r

1285
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:38,047
R squared formula to calculate the surface gravity and it turns out that you get about the same crime

1286
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,679
16% of the gravity that you would have on regular

1287
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
So we can bounce

1288
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
Accepted so you would be able to bounce around surface of blueberries

1289
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
Blueberries

1290
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,623
Welliver squishable

1291
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:10,303
So Ender says will happen is that as you're bouncing on the surface of blueberries will radiate

1292
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
Pressure downwards into the center of the planet score

1293
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,543
Hooters at the center of the planet will start bursztynowa squishing

1294
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
1st and 1st and Bruce

1295
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,175
Until it more liquid than it was blueberries at the center

1296
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,015
And is that happened

1297
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
Planet starts to compress

1298
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:37,951
And normally when you pack a blueberry they're like little corners of are tucked in between each one but once that's being replaced with

1299
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,255
Liquid that is being squeezed and squeezed

1300
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,327
That air has to go somewhere and it gets pushed up

1301
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
About like a volcano

1302
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
Through the core up

1303
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
To the surface of blueberry

1304
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Who haven't been

1305
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Then

1306
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:58,943
Another gaesser start the total gravitational energy of the constant

1307
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Density sphere remembers Luna gravity so you going to get the cases

1308
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,743
Dairy farm small letter

1309
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:18,143
We tell me tell me how high up I never seen a geyser this is not a funeral at the Geyser in Yellowstone

1310
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
Kilometer of the rookie on the water boiling

1311
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,127
Meters of moving air a blueberry powder

1312
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,735
Just go to be tremendously dramatic

1313
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,807
These guys are they hot they must be hot

1314
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,743
One of those things where you might have noticed if you were pumping up your bike

1315
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:48,095
Prussic acid gets warmer Heat

1316
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:53,983
You're going to get boiling blueberry jam all over the place

1317
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:00,383
The geishas I think some of them are likely to notice it some of the blueberries into orbit

1318
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,783
Well, they're streaking across the sky shooting stars

1319
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Imagine

1320
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,367
And meanwhile geysers are exploding everywhere

1321
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:15,999
Because all this Jam is a shooting out from the center it has to go somewhere and when it drops back down to earth

1322
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,351
It just covers the earth in warm blueberry jam

1323
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
And so it's no longer like a surface of

1324
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,519
Full blueberries it's just like

1325
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:32,895
An exoplanet like an ocean planet of blueberry jam

1326
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
Yeah

1327
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Noland

1328
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
That's pretty cool to imagine

1329
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,655
Is it like an ocean like we would think the notion of kind of similar but

1330
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:00,287
It's going to be like a little bit more nothing like there's going to be massive waves

1331
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,895
But here on Earth at some point the wave Galaxy squishies down cuz I be like nah

1332
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,295
Gravity Falls Gravity so they can be actually much taller can you

1333
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,855
East Coast surfing on blueberry jam ocean waves

1334
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
I think you come

1335
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:21,535
This might be easy for us with not to use the surfing is that they going to be moving more slowly

1336
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,167
That kind of sounds like my ideal to learn how to surf is just to let go slowly in a jam wave

1337
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:32,543
Yep and if you fall and you just get to Lake Lane Jam

1338
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
Okay so

1339
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,687
Address Artemis Jam wave which by the way is now your amazing life

1340
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
University things

1341
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,783
First you noticed that the air is pretty

1342
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:49,439
About 10 times bigger than it is on regular Earth which means you go to have enormous clouds

1343
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:55,071
The scale height of the atmosphere

1344
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Disgruntled hazy

1345
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Disguises

1346
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,471
Blue purple white milky color

1347
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Swirls

1348
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,567
I think you would probably find that it's going to be relativity

1349
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,223
Another thing I noticed is that the days will be a little bit shorter because blueberry or the compressor

1350
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,087
We end up with a planet with .89 time angular momentum conservation gives

1351
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
So you're there you're surfing and then you look up

1352
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
The problem for the Moon is it's bound to Earth right now but only because the Earth

1353
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,959
Western States blueberries if the mass goes down a lot

1354
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,543
Keep hold of it I got a lot of other things that has to worry about

1355
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
Orbit around the Salton Sea

1356
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,895
Recede into the sky

1357
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,271
But now we have an interesting problem

1358
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,951
You better or if he's going into an orbit around the Sun and the Moon is also orbit

1359
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
Roughly in the same orbit

1360
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
But they're very close

1361
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,631
So from time to time you might just see the moon

1362
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:08,287
Swirl by at night time and then eventually according to the mass there will come a time

1363
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
Bangkok Get Closer Closer Closer

1364
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,271
No pairs of time it's pretty like living

1365
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
Sooner or later

1366
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:34,143
They will collide

1367
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
The blueberry Earth and the moon will collide

1368
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
Oh yes

1369
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,519
It's going to be a big splash

1370
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,407
Who's going to win my guess is that the Moondance office of Court on there

1371
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
Then and now Friday

1372
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,735
It says if we just like

1373
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,343
Absorbed the moon and put it into blueberry Earth in this mood and gets to live

1374
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
With in blueberries

1375
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Forever

1376
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
More or less yes

1377
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:02,047
Even imagine the moon splashing into it is probably go to sell blueberry jam at Roseville solar system

1378
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:08,447
Deleting too also two very hilarious to call of the craters on other planets

1379
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Innovative

1380
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,127
So the calculations have been describing

1381
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,687
You do them at when you do planetary science

1382
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
Is no

1383
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,295
Lifeline

1384
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,135
Will come

1385
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,927
Pure Imagination

1386
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
Our brains

1387
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,535
Developed it to handle the normal world around us

1388
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,399
But in some sense there was a overshoot we can imagine things but they're not here

1389
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
We can think about stuff at

1390
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,751
What to be here or could be here

1391
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
Door must not be here

1392
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,359
Supplemental imagination with science

1393
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,943
So we got ways of reasoning about strange situation

1394
01:04:54,271 --> 01:05:00,415
This is an expression of being Uomo imagining other worlds I think it's worth

1395
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,695
Really makes us human

1396
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:08,863
Thank you so much for coming in on a

1397
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,263
Saturday to Talk About Blueberries this is awesome

1398
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:28,063
Producer Rachel Cusick

1399
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,903
Also special thanks in this episode to Sandra Clark and Alexander glacier

1400
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:38,559
Weather, I'm Diamond I'm on team blueberry now and second. I'm just not like I'm antagonist anymore

1401
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Maybe I'm just lost my

1402
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
Joie de vivre

1403
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,495
You think you did if you did

1404
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
Succumb

1405
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,335
Some people get Chihuahua early

1406
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Some people getting y middle

1407
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Some people get Schwab

1408
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,431
Thrust upon them

1409
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
Shakespeare yeah of course

1410
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
Yeah but maybe maybe

1411
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,927
The distance one has to travel I can pick you pick you pick a person out like at 3:33

1412
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
On Any Given Tuesday

1413
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
And you say

1414
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,047
How far emotionally spirits

1415
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,095
Do you have to travel to get to Joy

1416
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,399
How far is that that that Journey

1417
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,983
My journey used to be like I'll just take one step to the left I'm there

1418
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:24,383
Now it's like I got to board a plane I got to take off I got to fly all the way across the world I got to land the plane in Tahiti

1419
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
And then then I'm enjoy

1420
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Yes you have you have

1421
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
Slid

1422
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
Further from the

1423
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,575
From the ideals and you wish

1424
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
B

1425
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,183
You should just troubling me but that's what she that's the advantage of a story like this

1426
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
This is a story that

1427
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Can

1428
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
Gently tug you

1429
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
The way

1430
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
Gravity.

1431
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
And then land you

1432
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
Totally Magic

1433
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191

Yeah

1438
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
But you know what I will say just be just as a closing thought

1439
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,479
Your 80 Hertz is really good right now

1440
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
Is it

1441
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,343
Yeah. You got a little bit of a little bit of a gravel

1442
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
Happening

1443
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,207
Under the gravel I hear some really good ATR

1444
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Well thank you gif

1445
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,815
