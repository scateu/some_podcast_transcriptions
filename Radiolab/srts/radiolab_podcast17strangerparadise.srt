Yeah it was

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
I was born in Pawtucket

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
So after growing up in Guadalupe and graduating Sully decided to to get off the island for a bit when overseas

45
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,752
Fees for working gaetana's is lowest

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544

00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
True

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Then I

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Came back to Guadeloupe 20 years ago

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
Establish myself in the family area

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
Actually I didn't buy it but I was in the family for a long time okay

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
So I decided just to give them

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
And then we ended up staying saulino

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,912
It wasn't planned that you would be eventually they

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Kind of fell in love with Farm we enjoyed so it's a it's a new a different way of living

56
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
60 acres of land

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Rolling Hills bordered by the ocean filled with their crops

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,760
Tomatoes sweet peppers pumpkins

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552

00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552

Golf ball size

75
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,120
Cool poured into the side of it

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
And in the watermelon itself had just been emptied out it's incredible it's like they

77
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Play football

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,944
Glittered with Halo water

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
This this is the worst attack we've had in about three years that I said it did it specially because you were coming

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
I'd like to ask this cuz I think it's time or what is doing

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Raccoons raccoons

82
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Raccoon

83
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Rec

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Yes those masked Bandits with the with the

85
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,031
Little tiny hands and adorable adorable at all

86
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
I don't know there's so not cute no knowing no horrible you have to give

87
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
Even if they are clever they were sneaking into Sully and Lois's field at night finding the big

88
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Biggest rapist

89
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Watermelon in the patch

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,535
Boring a tiny hole into it's creeping out the juicy innards digiscope adults and chowing down

91
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,119
It's a fiesta and Brazilian Louis this was a huge problem

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Yoobi stuff

93
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
You able to to lose a third of it

94
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
A third of the Watermelon Crop adjuster

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,663
Yes meaning could go up to 20% of Revenue yahshua

96
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Thousands of dollars

97
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Saw

98
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
We couldn't stand

99
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
This loss is too much

100
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
We have to do something

101
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
We have to fight

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
So what do they do with a 15 years ago at Sully and Louis declare war

103
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,375
Meaning what the start with we puts an electric fence around our field that will keep them away

104
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:32,031
Pretty quick in note to put the branch and walk on the branch can get into your feel any way they built the Florida Bridge

105
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
Walk over the branches

106
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
So then they're going to try something new

107
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
This time they're like we have to be there at 9 she sings black music at them

108
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,159
We'll run around reply to sad music at one point even us

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Stoop to just throwing rocks at the raccoons

110
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
He picked up a Rock on YouTube

111
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
I'm a good picture

112
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
But you can stay in the field all night long

113
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,959
So next thing I decide to try is okay let's put some traps out in

114
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
We tried to trap some

115
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
But there are smart

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
The big metal sword a tripwire

117
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
But the one day there was no trap

118
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,991
We found the trapper in the woods and it was all bent up

119
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
We did they run away with the truth

120
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
The raccoons were actually destroying that sometimes we just

121
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
I decided okay

122
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,071
Had to try the dogs guard dog put their dogs in the field

123
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,215
By the next day when we came it was it was it was it was

124
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
The raccoons killed one of your dog exactly

125
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,895
All of his intestines were outside so it was a jewel to the death

126
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
So you know what kind of animal dealing with

127
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,111
This confirmed every feeling I have about raccoons

128
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
They're not just clever they're fierce

129
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Good and bad in everyone of these are obviously not very nice raccoons and if I were

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Lewiston Sally's position eichorst

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
I wish you something I thought that if anybody would be on

132
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
I'm bored with

133
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
With some sort of eradication

134
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Campaign I

135
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
But when I floated this idea by them

136
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
If I was you I would want to kill those raccoon

137
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
They just kind of looked at me funny

138
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Killing them

139
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
It's a little love

140
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
A little harsh

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
Attacking your livelihood I'm trying to understand how you

142
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm stranger because I myself putting myself in your position I would find it strange to

143
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
It's just may be sentimental

144
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Treating you know

145
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
Wait what why environmental feeling

146
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
What does that mean

147
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Well

148
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Here's the thing

149
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,879
The people of Guadeloupe acknowledge that these raccoons

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Are super

151
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Destructive

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,767
They know that they are attacking not only watermelon Farms but

153
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
But goat farms

154
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,167
And chicken farms that they're going in tipping over trash cans in downtown quota Pete

155
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
But yet simultaneously

156
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
They adore them

157
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Michael Jackson love is so lovely

158
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Of course we love the raccoon they put them on their postcard we just think it's so cute driving down there mean

159
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Highways uuc billboard

00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
And on the way out of the zoo

Keychains of those

170
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,975
People people are raccoon crazy on this island

171
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
Why well it's it's really complicated it is it has to do with their history of the island it has to do with who

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
Who came to the island when and who gets to say what happens on the island is it has to do with it with power like who

173
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,639
Raccoon that steals all of these problems and ideas are are inside

174
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
The raccoons tails

00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
What is the hours for the Wildlife police

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
Spoke to my interpreter salary sign in

185
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,223
One day Miller was just hanging out in his office when a box turtle

186
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Guadalupe

187
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
And he opened it up and found very much dead raccoon

188
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Misshapen

189
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
Skin I like in a company's called This is a kristofer Helgen curator of mammals at the national museum of natural

190
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
Drunk History part of the Smithsonian

191
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
Douching actually has the same job that Miller had back in 1911

192
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Anyway

193
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,823
This raccoon that Miller had in front of him looks a lot like the North American raccoon

194
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
But it was small

195
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
And

196
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Different in

197
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Quite subtle ways

198
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
And so

199
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,831
We left large Miller baptized Olympian raccoon existing species

200
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Scientific name

201
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Brazilian Miner

202
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
Guadalupe and Recker

203
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,095
Putting a name on it and recognizing it is a new species implied a deep history

204
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Of

205
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,471
The presence of raccoons in Guadeloupe hundreds of thousands if not millions of years

206
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
Have it over these Millennia these raccoons have evolved into their own distinct species

207
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Found nowhere else

208
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
So is that

209
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
When do the Guadalupe is begin to love raccoons when they realize they had their own

210
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,367
No one and only yeah but it took awhile to catch on I mean

211
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
This discovery was with initially only being talked about in these

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Arcane academic scientific journals

213
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
It's not like this discovery was on the width on the front page of the guadalupian x or anyting

214
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
But then in the 1980s

215
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
Conservation really came into its own

216
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
Scientist started worrying about us

217
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
How about species disappearing from the planet

218
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Any particular

219
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
I started worrying about

220
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,759
This raccoon these raccoons and I were being recognized as

221
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Potentially endanger

222
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
F****** their only on these islands there

223
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Probably aren't that many of them

224
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Like we got a

225
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Hectic

226
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Sza

227
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,583
Sol de Guadeloupe is an overseas French Department France

228
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Decided to do just that

229
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,983
February 17th 1989 legislation was created to

230
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Detective raccoon

231
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Shortly after the passage of this law Guadalupe open

232
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Pittsburgh National Park

233
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,783
And the raccoon became the mascot

234
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
The symbol of the National Party

235
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Animal sympathy

236
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,535
And as the mascot of this new National Park became that symbol of

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Protected species

238
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
It was a celebrated

239
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
More like okay nice wheel of the raccoon

240
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
In more than just a symbol of the importance of

241
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
Protecting the natural environment of Guadalupe

242
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
Overtime the raccoon became in a way

243
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
A symbol of Guadalupe

244
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Itself

245
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,087
Who is it that it's really that simple for people like

246
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,671
You can definitely see it as the Bold evil in the US

247
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Aside from raccoons

248
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
You didn't really have

249
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,119
Hardly any other mammals that are native to these islands apart from bats

250
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
And so if the raccoon is the one furry Critter running around that everyone can point to and say this is something

251
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Special

252
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
No this is not the same as a raccoon you'll find anywhere else

253
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,455
That is an exciting thing is a powerful thing and

254
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
A point of pride

255
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
I mean we're not

256
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Suck it

257
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Did not and I

258
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Very good

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Meet you how are you

260
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815

261
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Age doesn't healthy

262
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
This is Nama Regis

263
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
You you were born here in Guadalupe

264
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
We yes

265
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Yes indeed

266
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
She's an older woman may be in her 70s wearing this

267
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Pink floral

268
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
That's her house was right on the highway with

269
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Westfield in

270
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
And that

271
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
She says is a

272
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
Is where the raccoons would hang

273
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,207
I presume there was a whole bunch of them just like chilling in the area because oldest

274
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Behind the house was

275
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Sugarcane

276
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
They actually came and fed them to sugar

277
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,215
Choo sale or open place you only work out there I love seeing that I mean it was always sometimes

278
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Pleasure in

279
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
Time in like seeing those raccoons out there to put cheetah

280
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
And at some point there was one that

281
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
We really became acquainted

282
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
At that point she scooter chair over and end picked up this black and white photo that was that was sitting on her dining room table

283
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
And inspect

284
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
When can I see the photo that you have here

285
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Crystal Lovato photo

286
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
EBay Chevy donut bun

287
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
Basically what's on the picture is

288
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Sophie

289
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
And I'm feeding her red

290
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
That I didn't to milk

291
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
Sophie was a pet raccoon

292
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
I had

293
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Back in the late 8th

294
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,847
And she talked about Sophie

295
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
If she were her child

296
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Baby baby make away green Fellowship

297
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
If you're making the gesture of like cradling of babies

298
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Sophie

299
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Can you come to us

300
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Sophia Sophia

301
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
She would run around and leg

302
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,167
Everytime I called her name and everything like she would just like Come Running

303
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Sophie I was really close to heaven like

304
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
When other people came to visit they could see that I had to

305
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
Is rare wild animal

306
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
With me

307
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Anyone playing

308
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
She got she got really quiet

309
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
In grass the photo type

310
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Sophie

311
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
You're holding it to your heart

312
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
SFO

313
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
When he died died I cried

314
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Friday's name

315
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
Who's really really painful time for me

316
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
Ascacibar Appleton Appleton

317
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
To have something of your own

318
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
I almost got the sense that having this raccoon

319
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
As its national animal was away for Guadalupe to distinguish itself from fridge

320
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:06,655
Guadalupe is always been pushing against friends trying to declare some sort of

321
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
A cultural or national Independence

322
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
In fact just a couple years before this

323
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
This law was passed

324
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
A group called The

325
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Guadalupe

326
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
This group that was fighting for independence from France

327
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,319
Look up a section of Guadeloupe airport studio in the government own TV station

328
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
Even a Chanel fashion perfume store

329
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
In central Paris

330
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Windows and doors

331
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Racks of hi-fi

332
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Clothing

333
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
And it fell to me

334
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Like in some small way

335
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,751
The raccoon had become a way for the guadalupian

336
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Dulce de France

337
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
This is an hour

338
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Not your

339
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
And because of that it also became a point of

340
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
Tension between France

341
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Guadalupe

342
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
Yeah what are you waiting for

343
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
The morning after I met up with na

344
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
I went to the police station

345
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
Good to see you

346
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
To talk to these police officers

347
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Do you mind saying your name for me

348
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
Read David David attorney Anthony Johnson

349
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Explain government

350
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
As well as a couple others

351
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,431
All of them but one were white and French they were stationed here in Guadalupe

352
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,015
And they they took us up into this sort of war room which was that

353
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
The second story of the

354
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
This Bungalow type building out in the middle of the junk

355
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
New China Buffet

356
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Genius

357
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
Everybody was sitting around this

358
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Makeshift boardroom table

359
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
And

360
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,167
Okay pretty quick after the meeting started they've been booted up this PowerPoint

361
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
How to get a PowerPoint up with a picture of a raccoon

362
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Display.

363
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
This image

364
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Of a raccoon

365
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
Crouch down in this chicken wire cage what is going on here

366
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
Well they're planning a raid to liberate this raccoon

367
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,183
In fact they had the location where it was being held mapped out with

368
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
With entry points designated

369
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
At the even had the license plate number of the man believed to be holding the raccoon and when why exactly doing this

370
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
Will because as Anthony grow yo the the leader of this whole operation

371
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Ming tombs

372
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:24,639
Espressi for the law passed in France back in 1989 declaring the Raccoon as a

373
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Protected species

374
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
It specifically outline

375
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
Killing raccoons transporting raccoons

376
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
And even

377
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Portability

378
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Having raccoons

379
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
For pleasure

380
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
You Can't Raise A Raccoon as your own

381
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Chick-fil-A peekadoodle

382
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
But you friends with the losses

383
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
They can't be held

384
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
And as a police officer in here I'm speaking as a police officer

385
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
I have to be here between 4th July

386
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
.

387
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
No question

388
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Zast

389
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
And so

390
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
What's the breathing was over

391
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,463
They headed outside strap their pistols to their belts through the rest of the gear in the back of his head

392
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
SUVs

393
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Intercom

394
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:18,911
Everyone is growing out where in three vehicles and 20 minutes later

395
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
We arrived

396
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,287
At the top of this hill peering down into this

397
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Lush

398
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Dense

399
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Jungle

400
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Driveway

401
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
We get halfway down the hill

402
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
And I

403
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
I'm here

404
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Clearing we spot this man

405
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
He doesn't see us

406
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Guy in a red shirt with a

407
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Camouflage hat on

408
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
He's got his hand behind his back

409
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
The cops tell us it's too dangerous you guys can't go any further

410
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,359
Sally and I ducked behind some trees

411
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
And then Simone and Anthony

412
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Wearing wireless microphone

413
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Rush into the clearing

414
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
To confront

415
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,647
Set up a little bit

416
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Lee Williams

417
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Ask him if he knew about the law

418
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Study did the guac Escondido

419
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:25,727
Even though I was like 30 yards away I could see that the guy just see

420
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
Confused

421
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Pretty harmless

422
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
All good here

423
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
He's cooperating

424
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Right away

425
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Wait key told them where the raccoon was

426
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
There is in this chicken wire cage behind this giant tree

427
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Cute little guy

428
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
This rough-looking raccoon

429
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Nicolette toolbox

430
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,815
Wire cutters raccoon and grabbing The Wirecutter like it. It was play time or dinner time

431
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,655
Cut open the cage reached into it these thick leather gloves

432
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,007
MMA grab it by the neck and

433
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Threw it into this

434
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Kind of dog

435
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Jerry Orbach

436
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
And

437
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Commission is

438
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
Cycle Gear

439
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Scenery can get

440
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
I got to see this whole thing sounds a little

441
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

442
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
And I'm here because I need your help

443
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,584
This summer

444
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
And I request

445
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,448
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

446
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,312
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

447
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Brilliant

448
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,688
Basically I want to hear about this

449
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
It just means you lean back and say

450
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Well

451
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
How do they do that

452
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 months

453
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Started reading back to you

454
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
Or maybe the kid was a piano

455
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,584
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

456
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Or maybe the kids in math

457
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
Music in the margin of their geometry

458
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
We're interested in the

459
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Specific moments where

460
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
A kid does something super smart

461
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

462
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
If you have a story please share it with us

463
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Go to radiolab.org

464
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Flash brilliance

465
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
And record a short audio message

466
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
Again that's radiolab.org

467
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Flash Brewing

468
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Thank you so much

469
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
I know

470
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
For this feature

471
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
Releasing a pet no greed

472
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,056
But we're going to go

473
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,384
Later that morning we went on the 2nd

474
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
What are we expecting from

475
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Furnace

476
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
Scenario in the seriousness

477
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
Clicked into place

478
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Korea difference

479
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Setting

480
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
We walked into this Courtyard surrounded by maybe 10 houses many of them made of sheet metal and do we know where the rack

481
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
A queen is supposed to be

482
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
I daren't

483
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Chipotle lettuce

484
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
Pile of trash thrown in this enormous white

485
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Cage there inside was it

486
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
Golden looking raccoon the amazing pool.

487
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Pablo on pookie

488
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
The dirt how is his all-round to Winter

489
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
See who is really in charge

490
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
But before the officers could do anything

491
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,600
Free IT Crowd started

492
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
No no no woman has just arrived

493
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Basically what's going on

494
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,400
Three or four people showed up head started poking out of Windows

495
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,984
And Sally overheard one of them saying

496
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Someone snitched

497
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
That there was a raccoon in the air

498
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
And I suddenly realized it when I

499
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
All of the officers were very on it

500
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Going to live

501
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Why can't we just just take the raccoon

502
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
For safety reasons

503
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Don't want to

504
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Sit here to

505
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
And

506
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
We got out of it

507
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Tell me what was going on in that second situation cuz I have a lot of it was over my head

508
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
I mean he's really understanding the context of the setting

509
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
I mean

510
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
This is not just a police I mean it's

511
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Why police

512
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Horses

513
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
Coming into and overwhelmingly black and poor neighborhood

514
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
That has a lot of

515
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Pino significance

516
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Discount

517
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Highway in fact

518
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,024
When I was talking to Nana about this the night before

519
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
I know know know she said that if police officers had ever come to try to take Sophie

520
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
I mean they would have had to

521
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,056
Take me in as well

522
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
I would have taken my my husband's gone and I would have

523
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
You know I would have shot

524
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
When we come back from break the tail thickens

525
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
We'll be right back

526
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728

This is Radiolab and we're back with reporter Simon Adler

534
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
The story of the

535
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Guadalupian raccoon witch

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
As we just heard for the people of Guadalupe

537
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
Is both the point of pride

538
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:55,200
We are in the back room

539
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,808
Explorer of the museum have to go to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History

540
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
Here in the US

541
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,696
With mammalogist Christopher help where we are now is What's called the type

Dead mammals

545
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,472
I have to say for such a grand play Fitz it's a little visually underwhelming basically just a bunch of locks White

546
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
But that said

547
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
The behind-the-scenes area

548
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Where are the real Treasures are store

549
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
Can we take a quick detour

550
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
So I can explain what he means by that

551
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Okay so scientist

552
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,392
Taxonomists their job is to name and differentiate species writing so how did they do that well

553
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
Let's let's talk about sharks

554
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
Because sharks are kind of cool animals Brighton

555
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,840
Imagine there's a shark species it's swimming around its having a great time and

556
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
At some point

557
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Half of the sharks in this shark population decide to leave

558
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
To go somewhere else

559
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
I don't know they go to deeper waters or to a different ocean

560
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Get cut off from the their previous shark family they don't see him for a long time and over thousands

561
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
Or maybe a million years they actually start evolving on their own as third of a new a new type of shark

562
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,904
Become different enough that they've become a new species

563
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
That's what the scientists come in and try to figure out

564
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
How do they make a determination basically it's a comparison game

565
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
They compare him to the old trucks do they look

566
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
The same are there

567
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Dorsal fins taller or shorter

568
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,568
They look at how they how they behave in the water how they move through the world is that different

569
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Now it is all even just do genetic

570
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
If they decide it is a new species of shark

571
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
At that point they do this sort of wacky thing that I had no idea about what they've decided that this

572
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
The shark is a new species scientist will go and kill one of the

573
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
They will stuff it

574
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Put it in a box

575
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,144
And then they will store it in a locked cabinet in a natural history museum

576
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Because

577
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Ever After

578
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
For hundreds of years

579
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
That specimen becomes

580
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Kind of a gold standard

581
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
The definition

582
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
Of that species

583
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
There's a difference

584
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Key

585
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Four types another

586
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
Every kind of

587
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Moth or might

588
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Smallest mammal in Ivory Oak

589
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Free

590
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
Every kind of zebra somewhere in the world

591
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
There is a museum cabinet

592
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
We're locked down there is a

593
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
Physical specimen of that organism

594
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
That's so it's like it literally is like the Natural Museum history of the world are like the library the card

595
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
Life life

596
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
In the room that are that Helgen took me into

597
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
I'm in the sixth floor of the

598
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Smithsonian

599
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
Cabinet upper cabinet after cabinet upper cabinet

600
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
Filled with these type specimen

601
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Including the Guadeloupe raccoon

602
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Type specimen

603
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
Be very specimen Miller inspected back in 1911

604
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
So here we go

605
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
Pelican bend down and open this one particular cap

606
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
I'm pulling out of

607
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Big metal drawer

608
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
And inside

609
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
This is it right here

610
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Here it is right in front of you

611
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,712
This sort of Ratty looking taxidermied raccoon

612
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
Is maybe not the most pretty

613
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,064
The ears are a little bit broken and bitten off

614
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
Some of the stuffing was coming out of the belly butt

615
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,256
That's probably how it arrived Helgen foresaw this raccoon back in 2000

616
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
One of the first things he did was

617
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
Start it over looked at it in this small maybe like a 18in long like that that just like Miller had reported

618
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,544
But then he popped open this little white box that had the skull

619
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
And

620
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
Take a look what do you see here

621
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Keep Collective fine white lines

622
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Crisscrossing the dough

623
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
These are open sutures

624
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
Which show that this girl still growing

625
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
In other words

626
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
It's not an adult

627
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,904
Who's the Helgen with a big D

628
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Deal

629
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,256
Because ever since being a kid he was suspicious of the guadalupian

630
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
It didn't it didn't add up to

631
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,168
I just had a suspicion of Anneliese Tribune raccoon didn't make sense

632
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
He said if you look at islands that usually don't have just one native mammal species walking around Guadalupe

633
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:10,688
I'm going to put it on this tray the fact that this thing was a kid

634
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
It meant that there was nothing special at least

635
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
About its size

636
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
End

637
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,392
No by the time I I laid my hands on this one and looked at the

638
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
The skin and skull I'd seen

639
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,536
So many raccoons in museum collections at 9 to their skulls and teeth really well

640
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
So when I saw this

641
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
And one of the first things I noticed this

642
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,264
There's just nothing that looked any different to me from the common raccoon in the North American raccoon and soap Haugen decided to do

643
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Some genetic work

644
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,616
She compared the DNA of these guadalupian raccoons against North America

645
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,432
Did the math we made the comparisons and

646
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Are clear answer came

647
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Not only are these

648
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,344
Not very different they are just simply North American right now

649
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
You mean Guadalupe in raccoons are the same ones that come in and and torment my garbage cans

650
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Common

651
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,240
Literally garden-variety raccoon that we have in our own backyard scientists and conservationists

652
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
It is a real turnabout you know it goes from being distinct special endemic

653
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
McKenna found nowhere else

654
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
To just the opposite

655
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
Invasive

656
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,880
Sewing Helgen started publishing papers on the Raccoon in 2002

657
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Conservationist

658
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,208
Worksite because raccoons

659
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,280
They can have real impacts they will do things like eat

660
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Sea turtles

661
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Bird's nest

662
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,936
Bird eggs including of some that are potentially endangered

663
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,264
Today they weren't they were hurting actual endangered

664
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,592
Yeah it's so now that now that they have

665
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,688
Proof now that they are certain that this raccoon doesn't belong here

666
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,040
Then they feel finally we're going to be able to go out and start doing something about this

667
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
Protect the actually special one

668
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,904
Get rid of this one sort of faker

669
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
But

670
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
Putting conservation aside

671
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,792
What you've got is is this

672
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
Native to the island national icon

673
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Animal

674
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
That has suddenly become

675
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
An interloper

676
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
Brought there within the last

677
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Got 200 years

678
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Probably

679
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Just on a boat

680
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,200
Will giving everything that you've told us about the colonial history

681
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
How did the Guadalupe Ian's react to this

682
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,880
Well well we went down in 2004 Pelican and his mentor

683
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
To Guadalupe

684
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
And

685
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,048
We talked to some people associated with the zoo and with the government management of the park

686
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
And it was just a very brief conversation

687
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
She made sure that they had heard the news

688
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Why is this

689
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,776
Raccoon that's found only in your country

690
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
It's not

691
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
What you thought it was and it doesn't belong here

692
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
And

693
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
I remember that

694
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,992
The message that came back to us was

695
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
Essentially thank you very much

696
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
But

697
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
We're going to we're going to hold on to a raccoon

698
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
Yep meaning according to Blanding chemo communication campaign

699
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Held on to make sure the population knew that there was a change inside of the government never really told

700
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
And when someone did say something like Gerard Berry

701
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:25,248
Long-time conservation

702
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,088
Music.

703
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
I was interviewed by a reporter and I told him what I knew for

704
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
And everyone was just saying you know Off With His Head

705
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
Head some of my friends were like how can you possibly say this you should not

706
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Have sended

707
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
This is this bad

708
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
And soap for over a decade now

709
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Nothing is changed

710
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
The laws haven't been amended

711
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
And

712
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Because the government

713
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
Cut this so hush-hush

714
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
Many people on these islands

715
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
Still don't know the truth

716
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,024
My understanding of the story is

717
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
For many many years

718
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
There is this

719
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
In fact I

720
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Guadalupe accidentally broke

721
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
The news

722
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Tanakh

723
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,800
Recently it was discovered that no in fact

724
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,640
It's it's the same species that lives in the United States

725
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Is that

726
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,296
The change your feelings about Sophie or about the the guadalupian raccoon in general

727
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
Marshall University

728
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,424
African find it in the United States

729
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Is it possible that maybe it was

730
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Brought to the United States

731
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
The scientists say that it was brought here

732
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
From the United States

733
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:03,296
Watch Yokai Yokai Watch

734
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,256
It is kind of sad for me to know that it's not in that me to Guadalupe I mean

735
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
I wish

736
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,816
It would have been so

737
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
To be honest

738
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
And then

739
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,752
I had to even less enviable task

740
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm informing not

741
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
That just this past

742
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Bu past

743
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Dysregulation

744
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,136
We recognize that we cannot act on all the time basically

745
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
A black list of invasive species

746
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
What's negative impacts concerned or european

747
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Union

748
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,912
The thing is of particularly in Germany the raccoon is terribly invasive

749
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,752
Directions to actually been called Nazi raccoons as they

750
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
Spread from Germany throughout the contest

751
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
And so

752
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
The raccoon made the list

753
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
And that means that

754
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
That member states like France and us

755
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,552
Very likely overseas agencies like Guadalupe

756
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
Will have to start managing

757
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Or even

758
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Erratic

759
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
From the folks I've spoken with

760
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
There's a good possibility that in the next year

761
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,656
The raccoon is going to change from being a protected species

762
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
To being a species that can be hunted

763
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Trapped

764
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
And killed

765
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Steven Jesse Boykins best computer chassis

766
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
No no no I hope I

767
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Opatija Tibet

768
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,320
Michelle Murphy Malaysia

769
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,648
It kills me some Method Man kills me

770
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
The stop that

771
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
You know

772
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
People could start hunting raccoons like

773
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
We have to protect the

774
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
No no no no no no no

775
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
It's not a specific specie

776
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Yeah okay

777
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
But

778
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
I just don't care

779
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Angelique Charlotte

780
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Owner of the Guadalupe

781
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,296
You don't care I don't care if it's just the raccoon

782
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
But it's kind of a name

783
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
Crafter isn't it a kind of trick

784
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,232
That's responsible of the person saying it was another specie

785
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,048
People making era he didn't do anything

786
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
You must respect her

787
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
The animal you know of

788
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
Even Sully Louis

789
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
The watermelon Farmers from the beginning of the story

790
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Said

791
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
At the end of the day if let's say

792
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
They say okay as of this date the raccoons are no longer whatever I don't see myself taking a rifle running today

793
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
The feeling just lying in wait

794
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Play shoot them no

795
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,112
It's just that we have a oshun

796
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
Type of Wildlife

797
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,720
No no snake nothing so it all

798
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
Is

799
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
The bigger ones bf1

800
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
So people adopted it as a national animal

801
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
That's it

802
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
It's one of those if you can't be with the one you love

803
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,032
Love the One You're With texted

804
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Have a good one

805
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
So

806
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
As a pragmatic person

807
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
I know it's anybody's fishing today I know it

808
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
But I know also I think he's cute

809
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
And I think I like it

810
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
So

811
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
What is the best balance to find

812
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
You see I don't know

813
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
An interesting that

814
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
We need a miracle of the bald eagle

815
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,224
A kind of Richard bird that steals other people's Nest Anderson generally of vulgar animal

816
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
Actually but

817
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
We never think of it that way

818
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
Because we've given it Majesty

819
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
Let me give it yo its Talons there you see you both

820
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Peace and War

821
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
It has been

822
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
We have dressed it in America

823
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Every time a nation chooses

824
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,960
To identify with some wild thing it mostly really about

825
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
People identify

826
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Now.

827
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
The animal

828
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,896
I totally agree but I see like this like there's that you have this fact right there is a fact.

829
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,224
That the raccoons didn't show up a million years ago or whatever

830
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
It was probably more like to hunt

831
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Your stats

832
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Most

833
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Probably a fact

834
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,136
But then there's the stuff on top of that which is like

835
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Are they not

836
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
Troll are they invasive

837
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,328
Do they belong here though still feel like fax those who like judgment so can like who gets to make those

838
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
The scientist

839
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't know I certainly didn't realize the extent that this was a deep-seated cultural battle in which I was entering

840
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,712
Again Christopher Helga it's just the same information you know different responses and

841
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
I think the one of the deep questions of that

842
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Of this story lives in that

843
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Which is like

844
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,464
You you came to a scientific truth

845
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
In

846
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
The question becomes should that scientific

847
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Truth

848
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
Win the day

849
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
I mean

850
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
As a scientist you know I would say yes

851
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
There is a conservation biologist I would say yes it's important to shows us that

852
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Taxonomy really matters this animal didn't belong and

853
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Really perhaps it should be

854
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Remote from the aisle

855
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
But

856
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
At the same time

857
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
It's really a question for Guadalupe

858
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
This is our Island

859
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,512
These are there animals running around on it and

860
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
I can be very challenging for

861
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Scientists like myself

862
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
2

863
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Come to terms

864
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
But

865
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
That's how the world works

866
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
One more thought before we before we go alright

867
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
Before Helgen officially sang

868
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
Or dethroned

869
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
Guadalupian raccoon

870
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,496
There's actually another guy with a similar

871
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Hunch

872
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,592
This Parisian mammalogist named ijm

873
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Pons

874
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
I did one of those papers he wrote that

875
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
Even if it can be proven

876
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,552
That the guadalupian raccoon is no different from the Northam

877
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Raccoon

878
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,160
Did the best answer might not be its reclassification

879
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Or eradication

880
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
But it's dead

881
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Is isolate

882
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
He wrote that it's quote

883
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
Insular distribution prevents Gene exchange with the mainland and is likely to Warrant different select

884
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:52,128
The pressures that should favor short-term genetic differentiation that may lead to a long-term speciation

885
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
Process we was that mean meaning if they were able to keep these North American raccoons on Guadalupe

886
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Isolated long enough

887
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
Maybe someday

888
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,927
They could be reclassified yet again

889
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
This time

890
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Ezreal

891
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
Guadalupe Inn

892
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,031
What's your response to that pawns said that but

893
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
And I like it

894
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
But

895
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
I'd say going to be waiting a long time

896
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
That's going to take over

897
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:52,287
Do you want to give super super things to Sally stand ye who was our translator and got Simon everywhere he needed to go

898
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
And make sure that it all worked out

899
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,711
Andrew Ali Pannell here in New York who helped us make sense of the holding before we left so so

900
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
You are huge that they are very manual

901

Kirchner a jabroni beating meal

904
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
And most especially

905
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,047
Thanks to Simon Adler who reported in produce the whole story

906
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:20,959
Real quick before we go about what cuz he know how we were arguing about whether the raccoon is a good

907
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
Featuring Immortal creature and I was looking for ammunition on the internet to find September

908
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,479
It's been a Blog called the truth about raccoons

909
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,295
Andesitic contains a paragraph

910
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
I wish I'm pretty sure is not true

911
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
Pecos and I quote raccoons are one of the only land mammals who can also walk on the bottom of river

912
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
Dad's holding their breath for up to an hour

913
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,655
They eat both live prey and carrion be consumed after

914
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,751
20 lb of raw meat at a time then go without food for a week

915
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,567
Their skeletal structure is found in no other animal

916
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,175
And that combined with their ferocity and complete lack of moral fiber

917
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
Make them perhaps

918
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
Are most dangerous

919
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Anime

920
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,319
I rest my case

921
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,439
That was no chick stuff to propagate

922
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,839
Message run hi my name is Callie singing

923
