1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
Hello this is Lynn

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
Someone on the other side of us

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,576
Hey

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
So a couple months ago a producer Lynn Levy did an interview with

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
Yeah her name is Margaret Lovett

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
This was Margaret's first time doing a radio interview magic voice

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
But this is definitely not her first time

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Talking into a microphone

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,240
Profound

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Two three four

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
R34 this is the orange Ma

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
Almost exactly 50 years ago recording was made on November 19 1964

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
At 2300 hours

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,440
Margaret was at the center of this amazing weird experiment

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
Yeah yeah

20
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Who were you at that time like what were you like well I I've always had a bit of if everybody's going left all going right

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,264
Cheap tri-college for awhile University for a year but she dropped out and I was

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
19 Somethin

23
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
And move to st. Thomas in the Caribbean

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,016
Got a job at this hotel did menus check people in and out and one day she hears about this strange research

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Facility on the other side of the island

26
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
I wonder what that is about and I asked a few people nice I don't know

27
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
They don't like people they are kept

28
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
And I was told not to go there so I went there

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
And that's

30
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
Sourdough starter

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
That's how I can start the show I'm chatting Ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab producer Lynn Levy brings us a couple

32
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
Full of Close Encounters

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,856
Cut alien like not out there

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Hello

35
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
What happened what she ended up becoming roommates with a dolphin one bedroom apartments

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
Sort of yeah she did end up living with a dolphin for for many months

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
In this

38
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
Buy me a

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,320
Kitchen area with

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
It was a little two burner stove or something

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,536
And a pot and a tea kettle but the thing that's a little bit weird about the apartment is that whole apartment was

42
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Filled with water

43
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,400
It completely film well I wasn't submerged but I was in water up

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Miss size

45
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
Is just flooded with water

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,336
Just about there she could share it with this dolphin die young male Peter

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
Peter was a 10ft long bottlenose dolphin young adolescent male and he lives there with

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
With Margaret and like he would you know he could swim under the desk and there's balcony

49
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
The balcony

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,560
The balcony was also flooded yeah it's really cool what was the idea of me to try and study the dolphin

51
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
To study the dolphin

52
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
And take a lot of

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Extensive notes

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Did you have waterproof paper

55
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
No I had a

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Typewriter

57
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
Board hanging from the ceiling they also had microphones

58
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
And specifically the tasks she was given

59
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Pacific Peter

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
To speak English

61
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
She was supposed to keep the dolphin English

62
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
Really well

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
I mean this was John Daly's

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Project

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Just for some context people get all like a little bit crazy these days about dolphins shirts with dolphins

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,104
Poses with dolphins in blacklight posters right so this all kind of

67
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
Sort of comes from the sky John Lilly

68
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,064
Who was a scientist or researcher starting in the forties total Right Stuff

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
Physics major kind of guy out of Caltech

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,768
Man's man according to Graham Burnett

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Epiphany

72
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,471
During the second world war at the time people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins

73
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
In general like it was not this idea that they were sort of

74
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
Extraordinary beings

75
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
They were just like

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Big dumb fish

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
No they were shot for sports

78
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
Regionally is doing this

79
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
Research about

80
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Brain map

81
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
And he ends up working with dolphins

82
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
And

83
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Bonded

84
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,183
The story that that he's told goes that he was

85
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
Experimenting on these dolphins and

86
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
As he's working with them you know kind of like

87
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Shoving

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Things into their brains they make

89
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Noises

90
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
As with anyone

91
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
And when he listens back to the noises

92
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
She's recorded

93
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
It sounds to him like the Dolphins are trying

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
To say something to him in not in a not a dolphin e-way

95
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
But in a human

96
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
Way like trying to speak

97
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Really

98
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
What did you say the dolphin was trying to say 2

99
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
I don't think that we know that

100
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,535
But it sounded to him enough like human

101
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
That he he thought like

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Something's going on here this is

103
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
According to Graham he said later that

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
It made him realize like we are not the only intelligent organisms

105
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Like we have company

106
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
That maybe humans are what happens when

107
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
High Intelligence involves in an animal that also has

108
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Has hands

109
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
And dolphins

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Or what happens when

111
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Comparably

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
If not

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
Still more extravagant

114
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Intelligence

115
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Evolves

116
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
And I want without him

117
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
What do hands get you hands basically got you an appetite for punching people in the head

118
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,287
It makes us to users but the distance between us

119
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
You're the hammer

120
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
That you use

121
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,455
2 watt knock open your coconut and the hammer that used to knock open the head

122
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
That other Cro-Magnon you were never that Keen on

123
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Is in fact

124
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Zilch there's no difference at all

125
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,951
By the time get to the sixties if you know like peace and love exciting to think

126
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
The dolphins and whales

127
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
Ibiza huge Brands but they don't like they're not after

128
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,959
Anything I'm not doing anything with enough Turner anybody that not building cities

129
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
They're just

130
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Like being

131
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,455
And keep in mind this is on the verge of the Vietnam War where you have all this anxiety about

132
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
Do the overpopulation Environmental

133
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Construction

134
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
What are they doing

135
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
So very quickly the Dolphins become like this

136
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
Vision how we made ourselves

137
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
So Def

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
Then we come to feel

139
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
We were tragically

140
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Stomach signs

141
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
So tell me was one of the first people to get swept up in all this

142
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,799
He quit his government job moves to the Caribbean and sets up this

143
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
Lab John Lilly's communication BC

144
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Search Institute

145
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
To try to talk to dolphin

146
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Which is where Margaret ended up and my feeling was this is everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were and it was

147
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Awesome stuff

148
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
Dolphins and then it was it was the Hot Topic

149
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
And yet every

150
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,743
Hey everybody at that building would get in their car and go home

151
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Yeah

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
What is that

153
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
So

154
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
She volunteered to stay

155
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Her bed was on this kind of wooden plat

156
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Farm in the middle of the apartment

157
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
I was maybe

158
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Two-and-a-half 3 inch

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Bob's

160
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
The water

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
And Peter was right there and Peter could

162
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
Flip me a little water and wake me up in any

163
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
And that was the whole point of it I mean if this wasn't just sleep all night and then

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Excuse me working today and then

165
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Sleep again all night and then do some work in the day I might as well go home so

166
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
I eventually I didn't really shave my head but I buzzed it

167
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
Whatever it's called now really close

168
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,935
Because any you know the hair getting wet thing in the middle of the night was very annoying

169
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Yeah of course I just got rid of hair

170
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,615
And and that was helpful and then when Peter with comments word some water or want to play or throw something at me

171
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,687
Then I could just roll off this elevator into the water and be with him

172
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Do whatever

173
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
She says he was fascinated by the things she

174
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
She brought with her

175
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Piece of

176
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Sloth

177
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
A tea bag

178
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Tea bag was a fascinating thing and I

179
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
PrankDial

180
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
20

181
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
And the tea bag would fall into the water

182
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
And he would come and get it

183
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
And

184
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Sonar it

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
What is creaking noise they make on there

186
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Sonar

187
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
And

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
Take the string oversby cancer

189
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Women around

190
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
They probably will

191
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Tea bag and then you throw it up

192
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Against the wall and it was stick

193
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,295
And then he squirt water on it and it would come back down into the water and

194
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Cuban playlist

195
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Eventually coursehero

196
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Would fight it is very short teeth

197
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
And that was a very exciting thing when the teabags finally broke open

198
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
It had babies

199
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Billions of

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
Tea leaves floating around and he was so nice of them all in one

201
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Count every single one of them

202
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
What did you think you would find out

203
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Now

204
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
You know I was not coming out at

205
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Cos formula science

206
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Point of view that that's not what I was bringing to the table

207
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
Yeah I just I just I did I had no idea I

208
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
I was

209
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
Programmed by by John to work on the speech

210
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
Aeio she had sort of declared that they could probably speech

211
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
Look when your

212
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
Trying to have a conversation with someone

213
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
One person speaks

214
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,559
And then you speak and and I listen and end people sort of normally do that back and forth

215
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
When you start with a dolphin making Airborne sounds once they get the idea that's a lot of raining at those are

216
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
Every so often they want to overwrite you

217
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
I am not

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
So you have to

219
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,695
Spend a lot of time getting it down to I'm talking now

220
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Speak now

221
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
And now it's your turn

222
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,119
I can see it now

223
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
Upset about something Hill over my face

224
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
Pater

225
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Come on Peter

226
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
1

227
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,527
233

228
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Start again

229
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
1

230
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
2

231
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
3 yes but he learned very quickly to listen to me

232
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,863
1 2 3 4

233
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
Babies

234
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,799
And not to pick up my instruction

235
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,175
I would say no no no Peter I don't want you to do that I want you to do

236
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
This

237
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
This

238
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
This

239
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
He would give me back this

240
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
This

241
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
This

242
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
Cartwheel off and saying no no no Polly want a cracker

243
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
They will beat the whole thing of whatever you say

244
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Peter Woods

245
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Would pick up what I wanted when he was

246
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Being a good

247
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
And he was a good student there seem to be

248
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
Which is one dolphin anyway can't speak for all of them and interest

249
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
In in what we were doing

250
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
She wanted to practice

251
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Does he wanted to get it right

252
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,295
Yeah there was a mirror and he would spend long periods of time by himself didn't want me

253
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
To be part of it

254
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
And he would practice whatever it was we have been doing

255
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
In the lesson that

256
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
Over and over and over and over

257
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
He wanted to get it right

258
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Wouldn't work at that

259
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,383
For no reason he's not getting fish I'm not interacting with one another

260
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Just once

261
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
I like doing homework like homework

262
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
And after a few months of this

263
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
1

264
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Peter did start to sound

265
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
Really different 1/2

266
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
1 2 3

267
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Better

268
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Getting better

269
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Really difficult for them

270
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,807
They just have a blowhole like they do not have the apparatus to relieve asses are almost impossible

271
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
I would feed him my name

272
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
And M is very hard he would eventually roll over almost into the water with the

273
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Blowhole to Muscle Up

274
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Hi the same really you're saying he would he would use the water as a way to help him make the sound

275
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
With that word

276
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
And

277
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
And I knew that was your name

278
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
I don't know

279
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
But nevertheless we were up

280
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Pretty good match

281
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
I know his mood his temperament

282
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
And he and he knew mine he knew when I was sick

283
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
And I would get sick

284
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
Pioneer in the water all the time you're bound to get a cold or something

285
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,079
He just loved my anatomy he wanted to know what my knees were doing

286
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,711
He would go behind my knee and sonar and look at it and feel it and push it

287
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
And find out which way it wouldn't wouldn't go he just

288
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
And I gave him the time

289
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Cuz I wasn't going home

290
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
To look at my knee

291
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
To look at my feet

292
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
He was enormously interested

293
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Oddly enough in the space

294
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Between

295
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
My fingers

296
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
Not the fingers so much

297
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
What's he would

298
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
I mean it

299
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
You don't speak to just barely sit there but he wanted

300
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Put in between each finger.

301
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
NC

302
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
What that was all

303
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
The same with the toes

304
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
You didn't have any spaces anywhere

305
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
You know he had solid flippers

306
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,487
But no space in between them do you think he was so interested in your fingers and toes because

307
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
He didn't have any

308
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Yes I do

309
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
Margaret and Peter ended up spending

310
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
About 9 months living together

311
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
But towards the end

312
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Things kind of started

313
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
To unravel

314
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
First of all

315
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Don't really results from this

316
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Experiment they never were able to publish any

317
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Scientific

318
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Papers

319
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
And

320
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
There were other problems Lily got

321
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Very involved in

322
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Drugs

323
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
Especially LSD he did bring it down

324
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
He did

325
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Give LSD

326
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
He says he did I believe him too

327
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
Two two of the dogs I would not let him give LSU to Peter I wouldn't

328
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Why would he give them LSD well

329
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,775
It's not a hundred percent clear but it seems like he was trying to find

330
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,335
A way to get the Dolphins to open up

331
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Connect

332
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Maybe to talk

333
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
In any case by 19

334
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
5566

335
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
His funding it started

336
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
To dry up

337
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
When people heard about

338
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Markets work

339
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
They tended to focus on like one particular

340
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
The story

341
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
You don't have to answer but a lot has been made of your

342
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
Sort of sexually engaging with Peter and I just want to ask if you don't seem like a shrinking violet I just want to ask is there anything you want to

343
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Say about that

344
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
What would I like to say about that I think

345
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
It is The Sensational side of it is

346
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Cheers what Margaret told me

347
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Peter was a young dolphin

348
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
He was horny and

349
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
He would hump her leg

350
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
What kind of

351
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
A dog might do

352
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Just getting in the way of their work

353
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
So eventually I just said the heck with it

354
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
And she use her hand to

355
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,047
You know and and it would quickly satisfy him and then we could go back to doing what we would do

356
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
And I I never really gave it another thought I never thought

357
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Don't let anybody know I never thought

358
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
That shouldn't be because of details like this

359
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Drugs

360
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
This experiment became a

361
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Extremely controversial

362
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Almost untouchable

363
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
People didn't want to be associated with Lily nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lily

364
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
It just got this like

365
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Aura of

366
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,255
Don't go there don't go there even people who wanted to do really rigorous

367
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
Work with human dolphin communication

368
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Had a tough time

369
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,167
Getting a fun day and that lasted for a long time

370
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
The thing is

371
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Even though there are

372
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
So many reasons to disa

373
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Approve of this experiment

374
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
When you talk to Margaret

375
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Champs

376
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
How much

377
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Want to be in that apartment

378
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
What's up

379
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,463
He would come over and when he was in what I call his sweet mode and Peter had a lot of very very sweet moods

380
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
He would sink to the bottom

381
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
And take my

382
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Foot

383
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
In his mouth

384
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
And he wasn't so narang and he wasn't looking at anything he was almost like a little kid, she just wants to hold your hand and

385
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
He would just sink to the bottom and closes eyes and just hang onto my foot

386
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
And then you have to come up and

387
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Breathe and then you go back down

388
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
NHS

389
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Grab my foot

390
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
And he would do this for a good while

391
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
I'll be back in a moment with another encounter

392
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
You have two new messages

393
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,959
Graham Burnett

394
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,847
Arrigo

395
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,479
The Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology

396
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
In the modern world

397
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Www.

398
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Borg Radiolab

399
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Produced by WNYC

400
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
And distributed by NPR

401
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
I think that's it

402
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
Hang up now thanks again

403
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
And this message

404
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,007
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

405
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
And I'm here because I need your help

406
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
This summer

407
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
And I request

408
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,991
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

409
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Aunts and uncles

410
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,879
Teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance

411
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Basically I want to hear about this

412
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
When a kid you know did something

413
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
It just means you lean back and say whoa

414
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
How do they do that

415
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Maybe it was the moment that

416
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

417
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
Or maybe the kid was a piano

418
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,127
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

419
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,735
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

420
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
We're interested in the

421
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Epic moments where

422
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
A kid does something super smart

423
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

424
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
If you have a story with us

425
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
Go to radiolab.org

426
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Flash brilliance

427
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Record a short audio message

428
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
And that's radiolab.org

429
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Brian

430
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Thank you so much

431
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich

432
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
This is Radiolab and today hello

433
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Or the dolphin might say

434
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Howard Johnson

435
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
I don't know I'm glad that you know what that is exactly kind of the question of this next segment mean to dream that a human being and

436
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
Talk to a dolphin or any animal really getting their heads

437
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Cross that Gap this is a dream that you must have had four since like forever Saint Francis of Assisi goes away by

438
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
No it's so far as dolphins are concerned

439
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
After the John Lilly situation

440
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:45,088
Researchers did get a little tepid

441
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
No

442
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
Along Came this one doctor Denise Herzing director of the wild dolphin project

443
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,888
Best decided to take John Lilly's experiment and flip it

444
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
Rather than have the Dolphins speak

445
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
English let's have the humans speak dolphin

446
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,848
Are the very least let's create a shared language were humans and dolphins can speak

447
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
Or at least whistle

448
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Finding

449
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Finding a place you

450
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Meet back to producer Lynn Levy

451
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Okay so for Denise

452
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
This dream of finding that meeting spot

453
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,488
It goes back to when she was a little girl when I was 12 years old I used to

454
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Page

455
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Through the inside

456
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:30,912
Wikipedia Britannica in the days when we had books and I would always stop at the whale and dolphin

457
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,008
Look at the Dolphins and go now I wonder

458
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,408
What their brains are like cuz they've evolved in the water we were 12 I was I was I was a total nerd in fact

459
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
I entered this

460
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
Contest in Minnesota like what would you do for the world

461
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Do something and I actually wrote I would

462
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,088
Build a human animal translator so weak

463
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
I can't figure out what's going on

464
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
Am I the animal so yeah I don't know I got the bug early and here I am a fantasy about what you might learn

465
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
No I was just curious

466
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,680
I don't know you look in their eyes there's definitely something behind there

467
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Don't know what it is

468
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
Fast forward many years

469
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
Denise got a bow and I went out to the Bahamas she was like if I'm going to study these dolphin I'm going to do it in the

470
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,016
That's where they lived so she track down a pot of wild dolphins

471
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Yep she just

472
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
Try to blend it I actually

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
Anchor the boat in one spot most of the time the spot in the Bermuda Triangle in the middle of cycle of the Dalton Highway

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,328
Where Dolphins come and go they could come by if they wanted to and if they didn't

475
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
They didn't

476
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
When they would come by

477
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
She and her team would just

478
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Flip into the water and behave ourselves to start a watch

479
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Pay attention to who which dolphin had a

480
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Cricket sandwich

481
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
And when they believe we'd get out and

482
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,224
That's really how we operated for the first 5 years and it worked 5 years

483
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Spent five years

484
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Just watching

485
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
Not doing anything else yes

486
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
Dentist take an enormous amount of patients sure I mean

487
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
Grabacin Pocus entradas

488
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
So they started just going about their own business

489
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,144
Like feeding mating nursing and tok

490
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
Or at least making a lot of noises

491
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Which team her team would record

492
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
Wow that's all dolphins looking kind of

493
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
Squeaking sound that they make

494
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Sounds like a whistle that are more kind of Distinction and they make sounds are like longer

495
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
Weirder and

496
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
If you have any sense that each of these sounds means something different

497
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Well

498
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,664
That's exactly what we don't know I could tell you what kind of sounds are correlated

499
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
Fighting in with meeting or discipline

500
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
Find a calf what we don't know is

501
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Are there detailed

502
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
Words and there's are more kind of encoding

503
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,976
Information but what they do know is that each Dolphins seems to have its own kind of signature with

504
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Just basically a name

505
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Every individual has

506
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Peter had a name nobody has ever asked me that

507
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Here's Margaret again

508
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
His name was

509
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Really it is almost saying Peter here

510
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
So I can call you Lynn by your whistle and you Robert by your whistle I could be a dolphin.

511
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
Slim

512
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Baidu

513
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,464
Not only that apparently Dolphins will use

514
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
The names of other Dolphins who aren't even around

515
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Nickel talk about each other behind their backs

516
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Yes maybe

517
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Well that means that

518
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
There

519
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Using representations

520
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,336
Things which aren't in front of them which is certainly the beginning of language

521
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,944
If that's what they're doing what they're doing then yeah that's kind of like

522
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
The edge of language

523
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
So you know

524
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
It gives us hope that there's

525
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Probably more information going on there than

526
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Arduino

527
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Now

528
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Finally

529
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
She has

530
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
That

531
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Device

532
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Which device can the magical you know human animal translator device

533
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
Place that she was dreaming of writing about when she was 12

534
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
She has this box that can generate dolphin noises

535
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
And it can recognize dolphin noises

536
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,224
And if it works the way that you know that she's dreaming it'll work

537
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
It could be the first like

538
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Real

539
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
Two-way back and forth conversation between a human

540
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
And a wild animal

541
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
So we're looking forward to

542
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,584
Summer and getting out and getting more data and really exercising the Box

543
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Getting ready so I beg my way

544
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,640
Everybody good seasick pills left

545
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
On July 8th from Florida

546
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
And headed for the Bahamas

547
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
To see the spot that she's been following with kind of forever most 30 years now

548
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
Photos called the RVs Donella Donella is the scientific name for the

549
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:20,448
Particular type of dolphin the spotted dolphin have you seen

550
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,848
Boat like a tiny boat but it's not a big boat and it was just absolute

551
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
Full human

552
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:39,648
And you got a captain first mate research assistant

553
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:46,048
Meijer's Les Mason Bethany aulier volunteers

554
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Images of men for a long time I couldn't even figure out where everybody sleeping cuz they both seem so small is like there is not room for all these people on this phone

555
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,848
Stop hot soldering iron next to fridge

556
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,688
His name is bad starter you don't have

557
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
Like any dolphin experience before this right

558
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,392
Oh hell no to invented Google Glass

559
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
And I'm out here and was hungry weather to do what

560
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
He's in charge of these

561
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
These boxes with the boxes fry cost 100K at this point

562
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
Wiz when he came down to visit my lab I was telling about the two-way work in the difficulty with underwater stuff and he said

563
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
Wearable computers shouldn't be hard

564
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
Four years later what is this machine look like if you'd like one of those fancy Chrome

565
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,720
Toasters except you wear it on your chest

566
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:53,120
Are they silver they are silvery they have a bunch of sort of knobs and buttons and speakers on them got pre-program

567
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Whistles in it

568
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
I can punch

569
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Chucky and a project

570
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Whistle Aid

571
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
It was the be

572
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
She's programmed in signature whistles of some of the Dolphins rat pellet Bijou

573
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
We made signature whistle

574
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Ourselves

575
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Oh

576
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
She can call their names and then go hard

577
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:20,256
That's what you think that is the idea yeah and and if they do call her name

578
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,608
This name that she's made for herself then the Box should be able to recognize it

579
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
And can tell her

580
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
That she's been called by name it'll actually

581
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Say into her ear in English

582
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,824
Denise this is real time I call it real time sound

583
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Ignition but it's real time

584
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Whistle

585
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Definition underwater

586
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
How does

587
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,576
If she's made up this name for herself how is it that they're going to know that that's her name

588
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:49,696
She gets into the water over and over and she says you know if equivalent of hi I'm Denise hi I'm Denise

589
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,560
Over and over and over and they learn it you know they developed this

590
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Start music

591
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Call her

592
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
Hope they call you

593
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
How do you release a decision

594
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Vegas the very least

595
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
You could call their names and see how they react

596
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
Right with you that would be a Eureka moment I thought

597
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Think if you hit

598
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:13,504
The Lolita button and Lolita suddenly

599
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
Turned and look right at you

600
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
You with a shotgun

601
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
What the heck

602
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Wow that's

603
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Even called me by my side

604
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Solo hasn't happened yet it hasn't happened

605
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Yet

606
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,656
And this is something I just did not appreciate for a while I was on the phone with

607
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:37,056
Why is this so hard like seems like it should be these people are so smart like this should be easy but they're just like constantly

608
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,456
Being defeated by the ocean basically which I the ocean is like a worthy foe but

609
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
It's like the first year to work

610
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
Everything broke the boxes just kept shutting down as soon as we get in the water

611
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,656
That's not good. What you want and last year that the box is working but then we couldn't find the Dolphins

612
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,496
The Dolphins just disappeared where did they go

613
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,384
They went a hundred miles away to another location they don't know why I kept up with my side of the other days

614
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,944
Your Dolphins stood you up

615
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
One of the reasons I was on the boat is it felt like everybody was thinking like

616
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
This is it this is the year we're going to go out there where

617
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
Find some dolphins and we're going to make some history

618
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
You ready

619
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
Now

620
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
Any minute now

621
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
Okay turns out it's not that easy to find these Dolphins they're not tagged you know they're wild dolphins so

622
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
So you just like you go to where you think they might be he stare at the water

623
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:03,328
And you wait

624
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
For the first three days pretty much I would we were just

625
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Driving around

626
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Game of Thrones

627
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
In circles like literally in circles

628
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
Yeah I feel like I had like a like a

629
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,808
5 our conversation about Game of Thrones I've never even seen an episode of Game of Thrones

630
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
Dolphins anywhere

631
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
No nothing else to do

632
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Again

633
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,544
Looks like a dolphin that looks like a dolphin

634
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
I just say that I would like

635
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,408
Everything looks like a dolphin to me right now

636
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
There are days like that

637
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
Often they are right there

638
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
All the sudden out on the water with one fin to Sims 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

639
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
There's so many of them in there so cool standing there watching them Denis turns to me

640
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,968
I don't know what do you recommend it

641
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,064
And I was not prepared her to say that and also holding recording equipment everything

642
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
And so I just I ended up to tell me to go in like in my clothes

643
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
I like my shorts and like a bra and I'd like ice all modesty aside like a throw

644
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,400
Decide they're like you can go in and

645
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Cheesecake

646
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Ergo

647
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Bully Ryback

648
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408

Hey I'm Jenna Cam'ron I'm Robert Kovac does Radiolab and today their shows called hello back to Lynn

660
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
I mean it

661
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
Poodle sensory shift the temperature change

662
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:43,328
Everything goes quiet it almost feels like this like classic through the looking

663
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728
Last moment where are you like you go through the Looking Glass in like everybody

664
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
He's walking on the ceiling and I jumped in and they were too pretty big dolphins coming

665
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:02,528
Wright Patman maybe two feet from my head

666
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
And staring at me and I was like

667
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
What did you do

668
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
And how far were they from you oh my God

669
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
Like what we see you and also there they make these sort of clicking

670
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
Zonare sounds are like talking to you or just talking about you

671
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
It is so darn me looking at me with their with sounds

672
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
It was vibrating they can see not just body shape they can see your bones they can see

673
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Cn2 you like you really feel

674
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
What that

675
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
It was heart-stopping

676
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Whois

677
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Oh

678
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,880
Put in now and I am happy

679
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,440
You know and everybody was like calm down

680
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Those weren't even the right dolphins

681
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
Well those are bottlenose dolphins Denise studies

682
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Spotted

683
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,776
The next day we set out again

684
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Go for a few hours Bethany does this Dolphin Dance

685
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,832
And got some

686
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,672
You sound right yeah right there yeah there we go

687
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
So then everybody's like you I was like all hands on deck situation it is like strapping

688
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:57,472
Headphones

689
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,568
It's like a fire drill now I'm putting on my box

690
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
Here's the problem I'm just testing

691
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Unlike

692
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,688
A captive dolphin wild dolphins

693
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
They have other things

694
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,736
They have

695
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,576
Betta fish to catch you kind of have to entice it into having a conversation

696
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
Otherwise it'll just swim away

697
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,672
How do you do that when you don't know what's language

698
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,584
Well turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves

699
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,472
Scarf scarf they sweep it up with their tail fin and then they let it go and it wasp

700
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Through the water and another dolphin comes up and sweep sit up with their Rostrum to the ideas use the scarf as kind of like a

701
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Bridge

702
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Denise

703
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
Another diver will get in the water with a scarf passing it back and forth

704
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,464
Human the human like hey look at this funny thing we're doing the game sometimes we'll take

705
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
Press the word for scarf

706
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,400
They just made up a whistle for scar

707
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,776
Ideally and this is the key the Dolphins will pick up the word and use it to ask

708
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
For the scarf

709
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
If and when they do that

710
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
Tiny bit of common ground that you can build on

711
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:18,880
Okay so you got

712
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:25,280
Yes we're waiting for them right we have just before they jump into nice walks another diver to the game plan

713
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
You're going to hold it and you're not going to give it to him

714
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:38,080
Stop it in like way better and just really get them with you moments later

715
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Good already

716
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
Any something followed by three other drivers

717
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
Corn water were you in the water the sun no actually to watch the whole thing from the deck and like you can see from the store

718
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
Surface 3 or 4

719
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Adolescent dolphins

720
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
Hey Denise is right up next one of them to the back of her head and her little snorkel

721
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Sure

722
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
They're kind of like twisting around each other I will say this

723
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
She is

724
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,040
Tremendously grateful in the water if she gets in the water and she's like totally at home

725
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
She might secretly be a dolphin sound like around and around

726
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
She goes on there

727
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
And what is happening under there

728
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
This is what it sounds like underwater

729
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,288
This is the actual sound from the scarf and stay record everything that

730
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Go down together

731
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
I'm in a lot of that is the Dolphins

732
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
Just doing whatever they're doing

733
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
But some of it it's me with the boss making this

734
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
Scarf whistle over and over like

735
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Scarf

736
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Got the scarf

737
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah

738
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,752
Garf cuz she's like trying to get a dolphin to say the word

739
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Right yeah

740
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Eventually she and the Dolphins surface and

741
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:26,624
One of the Dolphins is holding the star of red

742
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Then they all go back under

743
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Anthony's comes back up with it

744
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
That's real good

745
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
Wednesday

746
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
After about a minute she surfaces

747
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
Lincoln East has it now

748
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
She dies one more time

749
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,112
A minute later dolphin has the scar

750
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
I just went on and on and we're passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe

751
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
The dolphin has begun to ask for the scarf by name

752
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:14,240
Eventually nice cap

753
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,336
And we all just heard gather around like

754
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,664
Well pick up the scarf right away

755
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Play something that you whistle

756
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:29,344
Five piece of seaweed

757
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,464
Nothing that trigger the system but it looks like

758
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Exhausting

759
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
Didn't get anything

760
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
Well I mean nothing the Box recognized as a match

761
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
You know nothing that indicated the dolphin like learned a word

762
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
So what's the right there

763
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
But

764
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
There was this one thing that have

765
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
She said that when she

766
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Address

767
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
One of the dolphins

768
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Bias

769
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
The dolphin turned around and looked at her

770
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Intitle caca

771
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Pitbull dog

772
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
Really

773
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,543
Wow

774
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:26,943
Also there was this moment where that and Celeste were looking at the data later and they saw that

775
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Right after Denise meters

776
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
Signature whistle another dolphin made its signature Whistle Sweet

777
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
You mean like she said hi and it said hi back

778
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,999
Yeah that's amazing

779
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
Well maybe I mean

780
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
The thing is dolphins make their signature whistles

781
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
All the time

782
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Or it could be this

783
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Moemon

784
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
I mean she's a very rigorous scientist

785
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Like she wants

786
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
That to happen

787
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
Another 30 times

788
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
4eva

789
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm starting to take it

790
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Seriously

791
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
But still

792
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
It does make you think about the possibilities

793
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Do you want to ask

794
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,535
I don't know I want to ask everything so

795
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
Like what

796
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around how do you spend your day and do they think about

797
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Do they sing about

798
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,407
Think about the past I mean we know they have long-term memories you know

799
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
How did they remember their calves from 10 years ago

800
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Do they think about death

801
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,855
Anything you'd ask your friends right

802
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Everyone disliked

803
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
They even get there

804
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
Miami will sit goals to have a Converse

805
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
And you can't do it this way we are

806
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
The wild

807
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
Can touch them you got very favorite whistle 35 * 1

808
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:08,831
Are they ever actually going to have a conversation

809
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Margot witz

810
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
All the problems of that

811
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Experiments

812
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,743
Which she was actually getting somewhere with Peter

813
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,583
Like they're actually having a real Exchange in the moment perhaps but

814
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Thinking forward

815
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
I believe that

816
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,447
What you can accomplish by talking

817
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
They having a two-way conversation

818
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Just infinitely greater

819
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,383
And I totally agree but if it's taking her thirty-something years

820
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
To get

821
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
2

822
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
A maybe hello

823
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
Yeah I don't even know what you got to Hallelujah and

824
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
If all she has is a

825
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
What's the limit amount of time with

826
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Dolphins every summer

827
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,927
And 50 more times

828
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
51 years old

829
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
God's plans

830
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
17 degrees warmer by that point

831
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,863
Dolphins are in a ball migrated to some other spot it just feels like

832
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,471
Just get in the pool and hold little left but the dolphin hold your foot

833
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,079
She's already got the hello going for her maybe so that's like a start

834
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,663
And then gets in 50 years should we have move past hello to

835
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
The three words

836
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
How's your mackerel today

837
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
3 word sentence yes

838
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
I would put money on a three-word sentence in 50 years

839
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
Question is do we ever get to the point of

840
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Exploring.

841
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
Yeah yeah yeah I don't know

842
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
I have faith

843
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
That

844
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
If

845
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,519
Please continue with what she's doing

846
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,823
That will be able to talk about

847
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
Concrete things

848
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,711
Will be able to talk about seaweed and we'll be able to talk about

849
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Coral and we'll be able to have a

850
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,647
Scintillating conversation about scarves I do believe that is not nothing

851
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,487
