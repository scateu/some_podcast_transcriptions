The federal government tonight outlining and elaborate

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
Expensive and extraordinary assault on US democracy

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Use of a massive effort

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,216
Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 3 days you probably heard that

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Special counsel Robert Mueller

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
Guided

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,872
President Trump keeps accusing of being engaged in a Witch Hunt

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
He has handed down to indictments information Warfare

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Against the United States

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Create chaos

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Going so far as to America traveling

19
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,424
Throughout nine states that you get from the indictment

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Is it there was a sort of like

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,800
Shadowy network of Russian Nationals had infiltrated the country

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,920
It with the idea of sowing chaos in the run-up to the 2016 election

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
Very simply like who are these Russians

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
And who are these Americans that were manipulated how did it

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
How did it work

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
How do they feel about things

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Now

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
So what we decided to do for this part

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Just cuz we are curious

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
And just cuz you know

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Fun for a podcast

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Black Arts

33
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
You fast turnaround stuff on occasion

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
We decided to see what we can find

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Producer Simon Adler takes affirm

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Pay Charles are you there

00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm doing alright little sleepy better than that of

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
So not too long ago I got in touch with this a radio producer reporter based in Moscow by the name of

39
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Charles Main

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Yeah that be great I'm in a sort of my pajamas but yeah

41
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Find the song

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
It was like 3 in the morning New York time at but but anyways I'm the reason I got in touch with him was to

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
Have him help facilitate and interpret an interview with this guy

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
My name is

45
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
I am from Russia, Saint Petersburg

46
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm sorry I speak English oh no don't worry about it that's why you got Charles 4

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
I think of a child

48
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Okay great

49
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
It was like

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,448
Where are you from originally I'm just curious like a little bit about who you are

51
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Resume.

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,480
Vitaly bespalov is a kid from a small town in Siberia

53
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Small town near kha'zix

54
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
And he said from an early age it was clear that he

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Just really didn't fit in up there

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,512
Blue hair for a Time dressed like a goth

57
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
To be this kind of alternative character in Siberia is not an easy

58
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Anything let me know

59
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
Which of these stories about walking down the street

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
I get some kind of tough guys with short haircuts or condom faget

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
When he gets a chance to to get out he does he moves to st. Petersburg considered one of the most liberal cities in Russia

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
And he moved they're not looking for just any job but

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Specifically

64
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
To be a journalist

65
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
He really felt was his calling

66
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
Superheroes that refers to journalist as like supercar

67
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Batman

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
If we had the same Petersburg and he

69
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
Thinks he's all set up he's got

70
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
A job with a local website

71
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Editing for them

72
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Writing

73
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
But right away with Within

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
Short order I believe the story is their business dried up and so did the newspaper in

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
And suddenly it Batali's out of

76
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
What's next

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
And so it's kind of a crisis moment

78
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Muscle shirtless

79
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
He starts looking around and he's

80
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
As he describes he gets up every day start sending out all these resumes

81
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,127
Doing searches 2-speed find anybody to do anything that would let him

82
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
Use his writing skills just trying to find something to do with text

83
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
Until finally after almost a month of this

84
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
He comes across this one ad

85
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
That's

86
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
It's not really clear what their offering or

87
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
Who's offering it but it mentions that there's some

88
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Copy editing to be done some writing

89
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
And

90
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
The pay scale seems a lot higher its if they're promising double the money is at the most people are offered for

91
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
The working in journalism in Russia

92
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
And then right away he just stopped

93
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Weird but

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Of course he's in

95
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm how could he not be in so he

96
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Places to call

97
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Now it's worth noting everything that

98
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
Is about to happen vitally we weren't able to fact-check 100

99
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
But that being said it does lineup squarely with

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
What others have

101
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Reported

102
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Anyway

103
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
Fast forward a couple days he ends up having the interview and they offer him the job

104
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
I would she accept

105
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Or the whale

106
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Still not really knowing

107
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
What the heck it is he will be doing

108
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Exactly

109
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
It's just not really clear what

110
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
What it is

111
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Okay so tell me about that first day like

112
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
Popeyes

113
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Entering into the foyer of the building

114
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
The entrance

115
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
The building itself is cement for story

116
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,951
Tall and the security is is oddly strip

117
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,047
Like when he went up to them they required him to hand over a bunch of document

118
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
It's like his

119
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Passport

120
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
Just to get in that's his first term

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Mythical man and his boss shows up this woman named Anna she walks

122
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Halsey

123
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
He said the whole place had like the feel of a hospice

124
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Long corridors with little rooms

125
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Left and right

126
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
People behind

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Keyboards working at computers

128
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
And it's almost completely silent

129
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
Except for the tapping of fingers on

130
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Keys

131
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
Anyway eventually they they duck into a room on a shows his desk

132
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
This

133
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Is finally when you get two cents

134
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Of what exactly is going on

135
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
Anna sitting down says we're doing news about Ukraine

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
We just want you to write articles

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
20 articles a day you had to do sort of massage the text

138
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
4 but the thing is he didn't have to be brand new Arctic

139
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
But instead he was told since we take this article it's already been written

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Somebody else's article

141
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
And

142
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
Or add to it and then change the contents of 70% original

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,119
So what's important to know here is this was 2014

144
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
And complain with in the early days of War

145
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
The apocalyptic

146
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Scene in central Kiev tonight's morning Kiev again I woke to the sound of gunfire

147
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,807
A civil war that Russia wanted to influence the outcome

148
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
And to do so

149
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
They started experimenting with his new form of propaganda

150
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
That's right

151
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
What you saw was this Keno campaign it was going on two fronts

152
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
When on the one hand you had State media influencer program intermediate here broadcast from Russia

153
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Ukraine

154
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Spinning the narrative for those watching

155
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
But

156
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Then you have a certain amount of the population that

157
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Rastas in watch Dayton

158
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
And this is where you get into this effort

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,783
Chicago plug the holes in the story online

160
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,647
No no we have been hired to do

161
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
CO2 steel that storage

162
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
So

163
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Yo

164
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
They told him to

165
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Take an article that was

166
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:09,215
About Ukraine for example according to Vitaly there was an incident in which a group of

167
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,847
Pro-russian Rebels had taken over a school in Ukraine essentially holding the kids hostage

168
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,455
When the pro Ukrainian soldiers when they when they stormed the school

169
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Children die

170
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
This actually happened and was covered by

171
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Vibe Ukrainian media

172
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
But

173
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Arnavut Ali's boss

174
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Says your goal is to take this real news story and rewrite it leaving out the fact that there were

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Ever any

176
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Pro Russian troops there

177
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,359
Treating the impression that the pro Ukrainian troops had stormed the school in Massacre these children for

178
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
No reason at all

179
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Brazil worship

180
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,295
And so once he had to be written this article made these small changes

181
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Horse photography with create a website with a

182
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
The. UA ads

183
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Ukraine address

184
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,767
Site that look like a local online Ukrainian news

185
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
Ostensibly written by ukrainians

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
4 Ukrainian audience

187
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,727
So he's being asked to write about Ukraine as if he was writing from you

188
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Yeah exactly

189
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
Exactly the way he describes it while he's working on his newspapers

190
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
Evolving events in Ukraine pretending to be Ukrainian journalist

191
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Deciding blogs

192
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
They're written

193
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
Extensively by ukrainians and he

194
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
Pretty sure that bloggers upstairs in the next level up inside this building a nest

195
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Saint Petersburg

196
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
So it's a feedback loop

197
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
What end

198
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
So I'm presuming on day one

199
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
You shown up there

200
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
With these high-minded journalistic ideals

201
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
And you have to realize that you've gotten yourself into something

202
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
That

203
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
In no way lives up to

204
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
To those ID

205
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
How on Earth did that feel

206
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
Cancel

207
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Go to Bistro

208
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
Important moment where he's trying to decide what to do

209
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
He says himself that he had cut

210
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
2 thoughts which is

211
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
Iau get

212
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Out of there

213
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
And never come back

214
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
Orbi to go back and find out more what what's going on there

215
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
And it gets this idea that you know it

216
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Maybe I've got a scoop here maybe I can do in bed

217
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Navigation he sort of assign themselves

218
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
To become an undercover agent

219
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Exactly

220
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
Okay just to to zoom out here for a second

221
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:42,559
The job that Vitaly had taken was with an organization known as the internet

222
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,007
Shadowy Russian organization Shreveport so much about in the past 72 hours

223
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
Private company established in 2013

224
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Buy a Putin Ally name

225
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Along with being the bearer of a rather strange nickname of President Vladimir Putin

226
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
Also one of the Russian Nationals mentioned in the Mueller indictment in the early days when Vitaly was working there

227
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,375
It was his impression that there were roughly a couple hundred people working

228
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,703
At the internet research agency but at its peak

229
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
Organization grew to a to employ as many as a thousand people for the annual budget of millions of dollars

230
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Headed by a Management Group

231
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,735
And arranged into departments including graphics

232
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Search engine optimization

233
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Information technology and finance

234
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
Now as the Polly told us it was hard to know exactly what

235
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Happened in this place

236
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,863
Because everyone was so silent but over his time there he was able to make sense of some of it

237
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
The first floor was filled with people just like Vitaly

238
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Writing fake articles

239
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Fake sites

240
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,359
Second floor was known as the social media department and the folks were responsible for pumping out knee

241
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,735
Like Hillary Clinton is shaking hands with the devil people writing fake

242
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
The same blog that the tollywood pull quotes from

243
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,903
On the 4th floor seat find the YouTube and Facebook, controls

244
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Along with the cafeteria

245
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
What's the Bill of Rights

246
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
Are you 24/7 operation they never

247
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Never stop making

248
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
News never spotted stops

249
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Generating content

250
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
What and who are your co-workers

251
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
Lost quite a few people from other towns of Russia that moved to St Petersburg

252
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,271
They were some people he said we're frankly you know

253
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Activists in the opposition

254
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Are there alot of people there

255
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
You know like

256
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
You know they check in the checkout for work they just punch the clock

257
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
And yeah for them it was just like mopping a floor

258
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Where are you know

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Are taking out the trash did you feel some guilt

260
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Or

261
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
Misgivings about what you were doing

262
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
What about really stressed out

263
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Miss her. She was

264
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
You know on the one hand I suppose he's Gathering good

265
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Material for

266
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
What will hopefully be some

267
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Grand expose

268
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Alright

269
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
The other hand he just felt like he was just living this lie

270
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
Eventually after three and a half months

271
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Vitaly did quit

272
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
And if he tells it

273
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
He had enough

274
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
And just didn't feel like he could learn anything else

275
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
And so with his months of research

276
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,775
He went on to write an article in Russia that really didn't make a splash at all

277
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,847
In part because the internet research agency was

278
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
Already a pretty well-known organization in Russia at the

279
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
That time

280
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Essentially other journalists had just beaten him to the punch

281
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
But then

282
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
In the wake of the 2016 election with accusations of Russian meddling beginning to swirl

283
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Inside russian disinformation campaign

284
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,959
From twenty-six-year-old Vitaly best for the American Media took notice and

285
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
Vitaly got a call from NBC

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
This is the building

287
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Yes yes yes

288
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
The troll Factory eyebrow piercing

289
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,783
Pink sweater on of Vitaly answer questions for this brief evening new II

290
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Did you create

291
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Fake accounts

292
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
Yes he says

293
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
Do you believe that this operation was backed by the Kremlin

294
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
He said

295
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Still up and running

296
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
The Kremlin denies it

297
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
Suggesting reports the factory even existed

298
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
My feet face

299
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
NBC NBC The Bully

300
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,151
And from that moment on he really became the go-to guy if you wanted to

301
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Talk to somebody who had worked inside

302
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,831
Journalists from all over the world started reaching out to him with nothing to you asking for interviews

303
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Comments

304
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Israel International

305
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
None of the Russian

306
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
Until one day not long after all

307
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
So he gets a call from this National

308
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,143
Tell television channel saying basic in an hour

00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,543
We're going to run a story about you and we really want you to come on our talk show

310
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Annie said look I'm busy I'm working and I you know I can't do it

311
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
And so now they run

312
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm a donkey to the canal and Basin National Park

313
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,855
In the TV studio on the set that look like a cross between a

314
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,207
Family Feud and an evening news broadcast

315
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,583
The hosts just start taking Vitaly apart and flashing images of him on this

316
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
Giant screen behind them

317
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
P21 the garage of mine his online

318
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Hanging out

319
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Club making funny faces

320
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Camera

321
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,527
What's Napoleon march to buy Super Sub Shop

322
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Digging through his political views the fact that he's a supporter of the liberal opposition

323
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
C o n n n they just make him out to be this kind of free

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
And they're all laughing at him and

325
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
Yeah he said it's just it's just an absolute Publix login

326
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Being a total public

327
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,799
Wow when he got caught in his own

328
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Little misinformation

329
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Loop

330
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
There at the end

331
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Yeah yeah

332
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
That's right

333
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,631
Lepanto

334
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Yeah the way he describes it is that

335
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
You know in some ways

336
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
When he was there

337
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
They were just trying to figure out the mechanism

338
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
It was getting more sophisticated

339
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Educated

340
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
And as he's leaving

341
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
His time is ending at the internet research agency

342
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
She says

343
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
Just about this time he started seeing these posts

344
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Four vacancies

345
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
In other languages

346
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Including

347
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
English

348
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,327

Turning out

353
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
Well now 3 years later

354
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,247
We know a bit more about this

355
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
English

356
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Initiative

357
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
In 2014

358
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
The company established a translator project

359
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Focused on the United States

360
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,999
In July 2016

361
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
More than 80 employees

362
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Were assigned to the

363
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Translator project

364
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,727
And many of those employees apparently took some of the moves from their Ukraine infowar Playbook

365
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
In Houston

366
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775

00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
End-stage political rally

372
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
The defendants and their co-conspirators pretended

373
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
To be Grassroots active

374
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,231
In fact I spoke to one reporter who told me about this incident in Houston

375
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
When the

376
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
Two protests happening at the same time

377
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
The one side of the street a white nationalist protest

378
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
And on the other

379
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,471
A group of Americans for Muslims

380
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
Print out both Proto

381
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Covertly organized by Russians connected

382
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
2B internet research age

383
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
According to the indictment

384
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
The Americans did not know

385
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
They were communicating with Russia

386
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
It was this phrase

387
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
Out of all of the Ludacris Revelations of the indictment

388
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
That really got it

389
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
Who were these annoying Americans

390
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
How did they end up at the fake protest in

391
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,143
How do they think about it now

392
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,727
Show producer Eddie McEwen and I we started calling around

393
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
We found three people at the center of one of the more

394
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Famous

395
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Fake protest mentioned Indian.

396
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,503
The so-called Florida flash mob will hear all about that

397
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
After the break this is Radiolab will continue in a moment

398
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:15,071
Hi there this is Kirsten recording from Orlando Florida Radiolab is supported in part by the

More information about Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

401
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,943
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

402
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
And I'm here because I need your help

403
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,927
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

404
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Aunts and uncles teachers

405
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

406
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
Basically I want to hear about this

407
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
I kid you know did something

408
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
It just means you lean back and say

409
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Well

410
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,127
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

411
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Back to you

412
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
Or maybe the kid was a piano

413
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

414
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Or maybe the kids in math

415
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
Music in the margin of their geometry

416
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
We're interested in the

417
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Specific moments where

418
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
Kid does something super smart

419
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

420
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167

People from Hollywood browsing the film school right I don't know that they didn't give me that much

452
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,496
Information on the phone and thought Joshua's voice sounded

453
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Fake name is Johnny

459
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
Yanni the musician

460
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,608
Wait this is Yanni the like Orchestra New Age piano god guy

461
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,216
Yeah yeah but I think she's just guessing like there's no actual evidence looking Yanni to any of this

462
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
What was the organization they were working with

463
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
This was the March for Trump

464
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
Group and they were Grassroots organization started in the United States Texas and California

465
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
They ask you what did they say when they contacted you

466
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
Well they were they said they were wanting to do

467
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
At a Hollywood people wanted to hire

468
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
Reactor

469
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Want to play Trump

470
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Want to play Bill Clinton and one play Hillary

471
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Interesting

472
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,984
They basically told her that they want her to do this like performance arts theater protest outside

473
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
Now at the same time she was talking to these guys

474
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,920
On the other side of Palm Beach County

475
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:19,808
The name of Harry Miller

476
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
Someone in there but she also got contacts on Twitter and over the phone

477
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
There was a conversation about

478
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,792
The desire to put on a something like a flash mob or something

479
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,376
And supporting Donald Trump

480
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,264
I believe his name is Matt what did Matt say in his original sort of communication

481
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
This is it

482
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,640
Extremely paraphrase because I don't have a distinct memory of Oliver

483
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,504
And initially I was very suspect up and the reason I was so

484
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Is because

485
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
A headache

486
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
Strong accent

487
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
And at the time it was a lot of commotion about Muslims

488
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,120
I thought he was some who is one of some kind I was trying to set something up

489
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
What did his voice sound like

490
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,568
It wasn't like you articulate it was

491
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
It was broken

492
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
What in Turkey

493
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,456
He said he wanted a flash mob and what did he

494
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
What did he say he wanted you to do it I he was asking me about making a trailer with a jail type of thing

495
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,208
It's actually the guy with the accent told him I want you to Stage an event

496
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
We have a cage

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm going to need to build this cage

498
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,888
But you're going to have this Cajun at the event there will be a Hillary Clinton impersonator

499
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Bill Clinton impersonator

500
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
I want you to put them in the cage

501
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Like you're putting them in jail

502
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
And you should do this outside but lots of people can see you and they can chant lock her up lock her up and you should take lots of photos

503
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
Videos and you should send them to us

504
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,296
And I did eventually say yes because he had an elaborate wedding

505
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,160
But shiny told me his part of a big group of people

506
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Being patriotic

507
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,328
It's dismantled according to the FBI now

508
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,936
I can't get a bigger

509
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
How did they end up paying for it

510
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
They sent

511
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Me to 8

512
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Check cashing place

513
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
How much money was it

514
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
That found an estimate

515
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
And I written estimate around $505 for it

516
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,112
But it did come from out of the country I do do recall that

517
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
Can you describe what this

518
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Once the

519
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Construction was complete

520
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536

Big truck

524

Yeah and

525
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
I build a

526
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Chain link fence

527
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Three sides

528
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
And then one side with a gate

529
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Four Corners

530
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
I had the American flag

531
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Of course

532
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
And there was a lot of talk about

533
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
Who is going to go in the cage

534
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
And hate hate

535
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
No one would play Trump

536
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,888
Answers the two quote UCLA guys suggested that she play Hillary

537
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Angie Creed costume

538

Harry was told to show up August 20th 1 p.m. at the Cheesecake Factory

545
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
That's where this was going to go down

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
Kept asking about are you going to be there

00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
We were given a script

553
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,536
What were what were your lines do you remember

554
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Let me see

555
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,936
Well we were supposed to talk about

556
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,264
My computer tablet in my emails

557
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
And then I was supposed to

558
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
I'm telling jokes

559
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,736
She was there with her very good friend Greg who she convinced to be the Bill Clinton impersonator

560
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,600
I sure needed the money at the time so what did you do to get

561
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
Prepare to play the part of

562
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
A Bill Clinton

563
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
I had to shave

564
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
Do you normally have like a mustache

565
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
I shave once back in the 70s

566
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
Then I shaved again

567
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,472
With when Jerry Garcia died

568
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Am I saved

569
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
I had to play Bill Clinton

570
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,688
What you should do shaped like three times in your life that's bad hit how did it feel to

571
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Be in this cage

572
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,552
Along with Annan be like this

573
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Strange

574
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Actor in this

575
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Moving

576
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Play

577
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
It was hot

578
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
And I was in bed and it was August and it's Florida so it's like 94°

579
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
And

580
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
All I could think of was

581
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
I wanted

582
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Girl beer

583
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:34,432
I just wanted to be over so you didn't have very much fun

584
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
No just work

585
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
It was Annie having fun

586
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
Yeah I guess she was

587
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Bill was supposed to

588
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,256
Find a lady in that would be in at like standing around like a news lady and try to flirt with her

589
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
Hey pal don't look now but I

590
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Annie's bait shop

591
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Cage for a while

592
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,104
What you see in the Facebook live video is a few dozen people in the parking lot outside the cheesecakes

593
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
And they're just standing around the cage with Annie inside of it

594
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
Who is pretending to be sad about being lost

595
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,368
Issues with a grudge exasperated

596
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
We spent the day doing that

597
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Took a lot of pictures had a good time

598
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
Pictures of course ended up on social media and according to Harry

599
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
24-hour sale

600
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
You're aware that

601
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,896
Much of the much of the mainstream media at the moment is reporting that that this was a Russian

602
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,992
Like how did it make you feel that there's now that possibility that you were

603
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
I'm came here to talk to me about it

604
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,440
Okay when did when did you speak with the FBI

605
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Yeah how long ago

606
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
Last week what did they ask you

607
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Well

608
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
They discussed with me

609
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
Pretty much what you were discussing with me buddy

610
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
Not it's not in as much depth as you did

611
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,544
This video guy was kind of experience

612
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,176
Cute cuter than Christian Bale 2

613
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
Reach out to the FBI with no comment or are you concerned that you may be part like

614
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Like that you may have been

615
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
Used as a puppet by people

616
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
In St Petersburg

617
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
No I wasn't using the puppet

618
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
But would you have done it had they not reached out to you in the first place

619
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Well

620
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
I wanted to help Trump

621
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
But this is a situation where our own federal government is

622
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Is telling you

623
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
That that this is

624
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,056
Essentially becoming an interstate console

625
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Flexware Russia

626
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Intentionally

627
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
Manipulated

628
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
People

629
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Do you find that troubling

630
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Stupid Howard Miller

631
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
And me and his wife

632
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
Veterans

633
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
No we're not that

634
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,232
Stupid you know this whole thing is being investigated and I'm like known as the unwitting

635
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Real American

636
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,888
So she's referring to a word that Rod Rosenstein using a press conference meme now these indictments

637
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
Teacup puppies Russian

638
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
To communicate with unwitting

639
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
American

640
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Quitting

641
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
I'm the one whose idea was to put the date of Benghazi

642
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Prison games

643
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:22,112
And I'm not a Russian I'm an American and I decided that I didn't want to vote for Hillary

644
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,208
Yeah and I guess I'm not saying you're stupid at all like I think what's interesting here is

645
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
I don't think

646
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,816
You or Greg North or Harry Miller

647
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,936
I think that you all had really good intentions that you believed in this man and you wanted to go out and support him

648
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
And I think what gets complicated

649
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
Here now is we find out that

650
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Even though you supported this

651
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,384
And maybe in the end of the day you you helped him win

652
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
That there was some nefarious

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,040
Work going on behind the scenes that led you to do this and I

654
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
I would have complicated feelings

655
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
I'm just trying to figure out if you do or don't

656
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
No because I do not believe that it be the case for the people that I dealt with I do not think it was a Russian movement

657
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
I've done article up here in front of me

658
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
And in the indictment

659
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,776
Are they refer to Matt skiba who is I think that the Hollywood man that you talk to

660
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
They refer to him as

661
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
From Texas and he went to UCLA

662
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
He was going home

663
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah I'm I'm looking at a document right here saying that Matt skiba isn't invented person

664
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
Well maybe that's invented name

665
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
He was a young guy ass

666
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
He sounds like what he said he was maybe he did give me a

667
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Bogus name

668
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
But you don't believe he was working for Russia

669
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,288
Why don't know because if he lied about his name who knows

670
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
That's what he told me

671
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
He said his name was Matt

672
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
The email that I had

673
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Was this

674
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Josh

675
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
Josh Milton

676
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
I'll let you know that

677
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,696
Josh Milton they're saying is also a made-up

678
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Nobody

679
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
On my TV

680
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
I'm not usually wrong

681
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
Puckett O'Leary's I really do

682
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,776
Because obviously what happened from what I gathered from this

683
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,128
If I was the one dealing with the Russians

684
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
How about that one

685
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
What do what do you think about that how does it make you feel

686
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
I don't think I'm stupid but I don't see a real motive here and how this could change

687
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Heather claiming it disrupted the

688
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
The election

689
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
I don't know how that could be by really again had they not contact me I never my whole life

690
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,272
Been up there

691
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,672
Harry says he understands that book invisible men the other end of the phone seem to want but you create a visual stunts

692
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,512
One that they can take on the road they wanted me to go to New York

693
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,816
They didn't want you to bring the key to New York

694
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,496
And the whole thing to him was it just didn't matter if it were Russians or not

695
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
But the answering Craig

696
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
The guy who played Bill Clinton

697
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
He thinks about the whole thing very differently

698
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
And I known

699
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
That I was working for

700
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Directions

701
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
I would have asked for a lot more money

702
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
But

703
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
I have never felt good

704
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
About the same because

705
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
I might have had a little bit

706
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Of influence

707
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
Donald Trump

708
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Being elected

709
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,080
And I think that was a mistake for America

710
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
And he doesn't feel like

711
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
But I do

712
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
Cities is the feeling almost assertive guilt

713
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm not I don't feel guilty

714
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
I was being paid to do a job and I did

715
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
Goblins at the job

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
To the best of my ability

717
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
And people told me that I did the job well

718
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,752
How does it feel to know that you were sort of used

719
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Nobody likes to be used

720
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
Irritating to me feels like a bit of a mild word

721
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
For how I might feel

722
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
Well

723
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
I don't know I'm thinking that this might be played on the radio so I can't really use the words that I would like to

724
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
UPS to ship

725
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,032
When it sounds like you and Ann have very different interpretations of whether Russia was involved or not

726
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
The second between your relation

727
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,456
You know I love money yes I do

728
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Are very mature

729
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Do we see eye-to-eye on everything

730
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
Now we don't

731
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
We all do crazy things

732
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,232
For love you can dress up like Bill Clinton shave our beards and

733
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,072
Go in a prison cage so I don't crave your attention that but

734
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
I feel

735
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Astute

736
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
As an American

737
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Not

738
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
By the Russians

739
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
But

740
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Bye

741
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
My phone miracle

742
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
The Russians

743
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Can't come here and vote

744
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
We voted the way we wanted to vote

745
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,368
I don't know if I'm making me something that sounds a little bit like you're saying that

746
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672
What's frustrating is the fact

747
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
That

748
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
It wasn't actually Russia that

749
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Started the fire

750
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,584
Fire they were just blowing on it and maybe making it a little worse

751
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
But the truly disheartening thing is

752
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Accident

753
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
The fire was ignited here

754
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Without

755
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,568
Yeah that's exactly what I'm trying to say

756
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
That mean

757
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
I can't

758
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
