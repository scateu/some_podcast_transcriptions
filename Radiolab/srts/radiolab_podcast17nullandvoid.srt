3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,984
Threats of violence might not be appropriate for

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
Sensitive listeners Young

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Are you awake

6

Listening to Radiolab

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,368
Radio WNYC

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
Now for some reason

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,072
The speakerphone doesn't ever want to go off

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
Can you guys call me right back and I won't put it on

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,448
Okay sorry about that

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,248
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this Radiolab and today

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
Today we have a story about something that

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,416
You might not know that you have but you definitely do have an answer to the crazy

15
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208
Maybe even scary

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Secret

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,816
Crazy scary secret hello

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
Power hey sorry

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,424
It comes to us from a producer's Tracy hunt

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
The story for us got started with this woman Laura

21
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,480
I am a freelance internet marketer she's from Colorado and in the mid-90s

22
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
Something happened to Laura that hadn't happened to anyone in

23
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Centuries

24
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
It's over it's over

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
When to take a second 1996

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
The day you got your jury summons that very first one that was the day of jury duty I had to I had totally forgotten about

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
The jury summons until the day of

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
And I picked it up

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
And I read the back of the summons and it said

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,336
Something about 6 months in jail if you don't show up

31
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
And so I didn't have a ride to the

32
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
The courthouse

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
And so I called the

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Court

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
And ask them if I really had to show up since I didn't have a ride and they're like yeah yeah you have to show up then I said well

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
I'll have to hitchhike then

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
And if something happens to me I said to them my blood is on your hands I wanted to make them

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
I feel guilty about making me show up but that didn't work she said I had to show up anyway that whenever

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,872
The point is Lori did get the current in Gilpin County in Colorado and when she got there she walked into the seats

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
I think there's about 40 jurors in the pool of jurors and Thursday fill up the box with 12

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
Soldiers and then they

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,952
Ask them questions about themselves but were you hoping to get booted off oh yeah I was hoping to get food

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Of course

44
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
Any any good red-blooded American was hoping to hot crazy in the jury selection I was I was one

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,168
The last ones to be selected

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
So the next day Laura and eleven other jurors

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
Showed up to hear the case and the case was for this nineteen-year-old girl and she was charged

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
With possession of methamphetamine

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,784
What happened was that she was up in Central City which is a gambling town

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
And that day she was driving in her van with a boyfriend and eventually the two of them drove this casino or boyfriend jumped out

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,304
Out of the van he went to the casino and then she kept driving and then the police pulled her over

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
They just for whatever reason pull her over pulled over for

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
But she got out and put her purse on the hood of the car and then

54
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
Made a lunging movement towards it

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
Which they said give them probable cause to search your purse cuz now they're thinking o the table

56
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
Answer the police open up her purse and they start kind of rifling through it I wish they found this one ounce of meth m

57
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Amphetamine

58
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
And so one of the questions before the jury was

59
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
Is this young woman guilty of possession of methamphetamine

60
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

61
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
So at the end of the trial

62
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
Laura and the other eleven jurors got up and went to the

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
The Jury Room to deliberate

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Until we talked about a lot of things one of the things I remember we talked about was whether or not the police were

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,736
We're lying about you know her lunging towards her purse and things like that

66
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
There is also the fact that she did have this mess

67
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
But it was unclear whether it was actually hers or not because according to the girl when her boyfriend got out of the van

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,095
Can you put something in her purse she said without her knowledge this girl saying the meth might be his but it's

69
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Definitely not hers

70
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
I mean to me that

71
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
The whole thing that's

72
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,799
Element number one of the possession charges that they have to knowingly

73
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
Is that soap for Laura if she said she didn't know she had it

74
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
And

75
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Could be her boyfriends and she's not guilty

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
It it seemed to her that it was just like

77
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
Pretty big hole in the prosecution's

78
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
I mean to me I just couldn't get beyond that

79
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
It's a law return to the other jurors and I said to him I was like well isn't that enough Reasonable Doubt for you to

80
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
A quitter and they were all

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
Like no she had it in her first she knew it was there it's almost 5 we need to go to Victory and go home

82
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
But Laura wouldn't budge

83
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
She just couldn't get herself the go along and so

84
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
She held out

85
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
And that night when she went home

86
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
She just kept turning this case

87
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Over and over in her mind

88
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
And she started wondering

89
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
What's the girl was looking at

90
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
As far as

91
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Sentence right but that's not technically what adder

92
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Supposed to do

93
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
In this case and generally the judge had told them you know like I'm the one that gets to decide the sentence

94
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,151
You just have to find out whether she's guilty or not guilty

95
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,247
But I was worried about some sentence you know you have is 20 rager

96
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
You have somebody's Liberty in your hand

97
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
It's a loris at dad on her computer she got online

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
And she found this criminal statute and to her understanding this girl was looking at 2 to 6 years

99
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
Like what that is just feels so out of

100
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,007
Lamp that doesn't feel right also it's a felony charge you know you can't erase that

101
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
So the second day of deliberations you know we just went back and forth where the police line yes we think the police are lying

102
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
Is that Reasonable Doubt no it's not reasonable.

103
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
After all my arguments about Reasonable Doubt we're exhausted

104
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
That's one Law return to the other jurors and try this

105
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Completely different tact

106
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
She looked it up and she was like look

107
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
Even if you think she's guilty we didn't have to convictor for any reason that we could let her go

108
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
The even if she broke a lot we can say

109
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
We don't agree with the law

110
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
You know we we are here

111
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,407
We're here to be the conscience of the community that's what I told them

112
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
You don't have to convictor

113
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
But wait. Seems like I

114
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
And I would imagine some people might be like what are you talking about of course we do we're supposed to just

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
Say whether she broke the law or not that's what a jury does

116
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Fred

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Right well that's where everything broke down

118
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,887
Because as it turns out when I started making this argument

119
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
A whole series of events

120
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Set into motion

121
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,823
One of the jurors apparently they wrote a note saying Laura's inherit she's talking about sentences

122
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
She's saying that she's only going to quit this girl got sent to the judge

123
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,783
And apparently the judge exploded

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
And call this all back in and declared a mistrial

125
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Sheriff showed up at my house with a summons for contempt of court

126
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
And suddenly Laura Story caught fire

127
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
First juror in 400 years that was actually punished for their verdict prosecuted

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
6 years

129
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Point is when Laura told those other jurors they could essentially ignore the law that they could disregard the facts if they disagree

130
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Read with a lot of she had tiptoed

131
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
This very bizarre

132
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Pull up some kind of people see as a trapdoor to an

133
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,103
Anarchy and on other side people see it as like

134
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
When is the

135
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,991
Foundational bedrocks of what it means to be in a democracy

136
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
It is something called jury nullification

137
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Jury nullification

138
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,791
Actually the first time I heard about jury nullification I Googled it

139
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,399
And the first thing that came up with this YouTube video that was like a little

140
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Explainer thing with an animation

141
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
And I think it was like the

142
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
First thing is sad on the

143
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Front undercut

144
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
Frozen screen of the YouTube video has

145
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
You can get arrested for talking about this

146
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Really

147
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
And I was like

148
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
Oh okay I'm hitting play on that let's go you can get arrested

149
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
You're talking about

150
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
Get well that ends up being a

151
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Sort of

152
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
It also did not

153
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
Which is what makes it a loophole

154
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Thank you

155
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Yeah just this way

156
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
Anyway as we dug into it we figured you know we are going to need some help

157
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
But understanding this thing

158
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
So I was thinking that would start with a little bit.

159
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
What's your notification is

160
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Yeah

161
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
So we call the favorite legal expert

162
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
Elie mystal an editor of above the law and the legal editor of more perfect on WNYC

163
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,599
What perfect what is that that sounds amazing what is that it will it will

164
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
You know what it's not worth much

165
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
Anyway

166
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Elite season 2

167
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,375
Anyway when we were talking to Ellie the first thing that we asked him what do you know what just give us

168
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
The pure uncut version

169
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
So pure aspect of jury nullification would be

170
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
Let's see I am the defendant I am accused of stealing a car

171
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
I absolutely stole that car everybody saw

172
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
They had me dead to rights all you have to have me on video

173
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
My mama said

174
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
No Reasonable Doubt

175
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,023
But I stole the car because my kid was sick and I needed to get to the hospital

176
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Take him to the hospital

177
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
I had no other option

178
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
It's why I smashed the windows to somebody else

179
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Car hot wired it

180
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Put Mike in the back I drove to the hospital

181
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
Save to save my save my kids

182
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
Now I'm up for child from the

183
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
The guy who has the Audi

184
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Rochester

185
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
The guy who asked me out

186
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
It's like he stole my car

187
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Which is true

188
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Imagery says yeah

189
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Now we're just going to

190
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,159
The jury would nullify that clear

191
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
Bat clear illegality

192
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Clear crime that I committed so it's like

193
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Yes he took the car but

194
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
The law by the way it's written doesn't

195
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Account for the fact

196
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
That in this particular case

197
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
That's okay with us

198
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
So that's

199
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
That that's kind of

200
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Sure

201
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Version

202
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
And that's kind of the most

203
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Kind of Happy clappy

204
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
It's a very happy version

205
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
I could have stolen Justin Bieber's car

206
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
I probably couldn't get convicted in a court

207
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
For that

208
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
The nobody likes him nobody likes him

209
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,487
So they could be saying the laws not nuanced enough they could be saying the punishment is

210
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Off they could be saying

211
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
In this case the

212
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
Victims are deserved it

213
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Or they could be saying

214
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
We disagree with this

215
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Right away

216
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
It's something I understand is like

217
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
It's so here we have a situation where Laura says she doesn't do with

218
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Descendants

219
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
What does she or any of the other jurors have like

220
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
A'right

221
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
To do this is there is there like something written in the Constitution

222
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,623
It says they can do that no there's nothing in the Constitution that

223
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
The direct

224
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Explicitly says

225
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
Yes you have the right to completely ignore the law and let off whenever you want to

226
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
That's not a constitutional right

227
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Okay

228
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Crying because Ellie says a jury is told to do what they think is

229
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,031
Best if they think their best is nullifying

230
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
Aloha

231
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
That's also not exactly illegal

232
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,223
Which disc get back to Laura first second is why the court never actually charged

233
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Perfectdry notification

234
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,391
Instead they found her guilty for not answering questions directly during the jury question process

235
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
Eventually that conviction was overturned on appeal because

236
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,303
In general the things that are said in a jury room are protected

237
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Their private so it's not

238
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Right it's not a crime

239
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
What it is is a power

240
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,871
And so I think of it kind of like

241
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Wolverine

242
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Power

243
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Is Keaton

244
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
She can be patched

245
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Deal

246
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
Adamantium claws

247
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
That's just a

248
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Back of Wolverine's wife

249
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
He has the ability to do that

250
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
It's his power

251
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Now

252
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
Is it alright for him to have claws shooting out of it and no

253
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
Absolutely not is it illegal for him to have claws shooting out of

254
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Well

255
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Not really

256
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
It's illegal for him to use them in certain ways

257
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
Rights to Wolverine comes into your house

258
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
And scratches you on the face that's assault we have a law against

259
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Wolverine has the power

260
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
To just

261
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Walk around as he is

262
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
With these claws in his hands

263
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Built into the nature of his being

264
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
Real quick to the people who care about

265
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Superhero Powers we know that Wolverine's Powers apps

266
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
United heal

267
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
But at least point

268
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Don't hold

269
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Wait a second

270
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
The tree like it

271
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Claws

272
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
To the jury has this

273
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Claw

274
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Whatever

275
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
But these simple point is

276
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
That

277
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Jury nullification is as fundamental to juries

278
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
As having

279
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Klaus is the Wolverine

280
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
That's just

281
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
A fact of their existence

282
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
But they still get in trouble if they use it

283
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Lorded but then how did we end up in this weird

284
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Place where you can

285
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,543
Do it you don't have the right to do it but you can do it but if you do it

286
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Or even

287
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Talk about it you might get in trouble

288
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
That question because it gives me a chance to update Matt are you back there can you queue some like English jaunty

289
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
1700s type music

290
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Coming right up

291
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
All right now we're in the mood

292
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Fluorite

293
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Explain yeah so I ended up finding this guy Jeffrey Abramson of Law & government the University of Texas at

294
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Johnston told me you don't have to do with the sort of battle over who has the power to decide

295
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
What the law is

296
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
And he says the opening shots of that battle go all the way back to William Penn trial in 16:7

297
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Any which is really the birth of religious liberty

298
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
I guess we can also use some sounds of horses

299
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Cobblestone streets and

300
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Sister Sister

301
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
So much better thank you okay so it's 1670 London England we've got a guy William Penn

302
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
I'm with a young man he was a Quaker

303
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
And one day he walking through the Streets of London hold a prayer meeting and Grace Church meeting Chapel

304
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Welcome to the chapel door

305
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
But

306
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
Define deadlock by the authorities

307
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,879
And the reason the doors were locked up because there was actually this century-old law on the books it made it a crime to

308
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Essentially to be a Quaker

309
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
But what pain does

310
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Hey

311
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
That

312
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,399
Okay one both of you two

313
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Pain starts

314
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Calling everybody together in the street and as more people start to gather

315
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
Wrong like three or four hundred people show up

316
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Come on come on so it's already seized the occasion to

317
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Arrest him for breach of the Peace

318
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
And eventually

319
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
And get thrown in jail and he gets a jury trial

320
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,727
This follows that William

321
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,359
Of London now the government became he was pretty much just charging pin for being a Quaker

322
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
But the authorities

323
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
Thought they could go underneath the table and just

324
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Prosecute him for what was

325
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Common law crime of breach of the Peace

326
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,415
Are you guilty as you stand indicted in matter and form as for said or not guilty

327
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
I plead not guilty

328
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Matter and form

329
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,047
The case is pretty open-and-shut I mean

330
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,399
Gathered hundreds of people in the middle of the street according to law and the evidence he is guilty

331
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
But

332
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
His

333
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Defense is

334
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
Show me what law in England makes it a crime

335
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
To worship God in my own way

336
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
Stop the dream went out to the Jury Room

337
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,551
The jurors come back several times and say we cannot agree

338
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,927
What was their hang up well don't know how inside the heads of those people you can get but it seems like they just

339
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Didn't feel like

340
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
Locking him up for that was the right thing to do even though it's technically against the law

341
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
And so the judge says to the jurors I am telling you

342
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
That is

343
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
The evidence shows

344
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
The 10 preach

345
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
What's wrong

346
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
On a public thoroughfare

347
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
And he clearly did I have to find him guilty of the crime of breach of the Peace

348
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
And then the judge lock them up in the Jury Room

349
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
Without food tobacco or rest facilities for a quote

350
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Considerable amount of time

351
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
And quote and then finally they come back

352
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Hancock

353
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Quit vim

354
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
The judge accepts the acquittal

355
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
And then orders that yours too

356
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,263
Jail for perjury with the whole jury in jail I got locked up

357
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Not cool

358
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
So that guy end up filing a

359
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,687
An appeal it went to the highest courts in the realm all the way to the king's court in the Chief Justice

360
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Rule that it

361
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
Henceforth would be illegal

362
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
To prosecute jurors for a not guilty verdict

363
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
So this becomes the start of jury nullification

364
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
And

365
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
I really was was

366
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
The birth of

367
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Bubble this

368
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,679
Connected space called The Jury Room

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
That

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Can't

371
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Punish anybody for what they do in the Jury Room

372
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
So that notion crosses

373
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,479
The Atlantic Ocean and becomes a part of the American tradition of law so that when the colonies are coming up

374
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,551
They have trial by jury and they have juries and

375
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,903
Smartdeblur writing things about how the jury is the place where the people get to

376
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Decide

377
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
What happens when we die

378
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Forecast.

379
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,303
Punish them for what they do and so you get people like

380
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,679
Adams and Jefferson making Grand arguments about the role of the jury

381
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,263
And actually Jeffrey says one of the things that we get from injury is

382
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Freedom of the press

383
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,103
In the 1700's this newspaper guy New York

384
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Supposedly

385
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Libel the king or the crown

386
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Into the jury in that case it was

387
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Pretty clear that you did

388
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,319
But they decide that the law itself is unjust

389
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
And boom there you go bring the Preston

390
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
This ideas her baked into our nation's beginning of trusting Ordinary People to do the work

391
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Injustice themselves

392
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Ordinary People

393
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
White Manna

394
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
But then

395
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
In the mid 1800

396
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
That's hard to change because of two things

397
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,407
One more laws are being written and it just more complex and complicated and it is harder for people understand

398
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Number two

399
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:36,831
The legal world is becoming way more professional more more people are getting legal training even judges who before didn't have

400
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
Necessarily have legal training to become a judge

401
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
They're getting legal training

402
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:45,023
And so it so now judges are seen as the experts in the law

403
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,607
And then what happens is that you seem or just would have take

404
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Bath

405
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:54,495
The power to decide what the lot is from the jury in the United States Supreme Court

406
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
In a decision in 1895

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
I know

408
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Responsibility for

409
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Deciding

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
Whether to enforce the law question number

411
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
1

412
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
Or what the law

413
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
Properly interpreted was

414
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Number two

415
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
And from this you get the sort of

416
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:17,535
Judge's instructions that are given to the jury and we still have this sort of instruction today

417
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury the case is now upon you

418
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
It is your job to find the fact

419
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,495
But it is my job to instruct you on the law

420
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
Now it didn't it wasn't exactly that jury nullification bikini legal and more like just the court kind of

421
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Pushed it

422
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
Down made it at start of unspoken thing

423
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
And over the next hundred years or so

424
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
It does I mean certainly there

425
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
Times when jurors refused convicted

426
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Famous cases are like during prohibition and then some arguments during the Civil Rights movement in the in the Vietnam War

427
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Or but really

428
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,495
The explicit idea of jury nullification the idea that this is really

429
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
A role for the jury

430
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Stays mostly Underground

431
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Until

432
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Claws come out

433
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,855
That's after the break

434
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
This is Albert in State College

435
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Sylvania

440

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

441
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
And I'm here because I need your help

442
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
And I request

443
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
For those of you who

444
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
We spend a lot of time with kids parents

445
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,408
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

446
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
Tiny moments of brilliance

447
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,808
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

448
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
It just means you lean back and say

449
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Well

450
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
How do they do that

451
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Maybe it was the moment that I

452
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

453
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
To you

454
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

455
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,448
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

456
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,312
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
We're interested in the

458
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Epic moments where

459
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
Kid does something super smart

460
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
It doesn't have anything to do with it

461
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
If you have a story

462
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
T-shirt with

463
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
Go to radiolab.org

Flash brilliance

465
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
Record a short audio message

466
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Again that's radiolab.org

467
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Slash brilliant

468
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Thank you so much

Jad Robert Radiolab

470
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,736
So we're talk about jury nullification the power of juries to perhaps ignore the law

471
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Tracy hunt and Soren wheeler

472
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Reported

473
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
And

474
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
You guys are saying it was underground for a while

475
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,512
The 92nd

476
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
It was a perfect storm of

477
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
Two events both of them California

478
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,592
Have the Rodney King trial where you have this video tape we've all seen the pictures of Los Angeles police officers

479
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Beating a man that had just pulled over

480
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
In this video you see Rodney King he's on the ground and police are surrounding him and there

481
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
Kicking him and beating him with the ponds repeatedly most reasonable of service that there was severe please

482
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Hospitality again

483
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
An unarmed black man

484
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
For Los Angeles police office

485
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,168
Charged independently the trial was supposed to be held in Los Angeles but

486
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
Because of concerns about media exposure

487
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,824
Neighboring Ventura County where the jury is almost all white

488
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
And after a month-long trial

489
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
And weeks

490
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
Jury deliberations

491
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,784
Majority in the Rodney King case has delivered its verdict you can't

492
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,624
An acquittal de equip the officers

493
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Of the four police officers seen on video tape beating with the King a year ago he is guilty of using excessive force table

494
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,168
Woman found not guilty and of course it happened in La after that

495
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
5 days of right

496
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:48,128
Bottles various things going at cars School Bus 60 people were killed

497
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,272
You can see a white plume of smoke and it's not a billion dollars worth of damages

498
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
I'm in this area I must say

499
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
I'm scared

500
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
We all saw what happened

501
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
And and it looks very much

502
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
Two African Americans in Los Angeles

503
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,352
Betty's white people in Simi Valley California

504
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,168
Race rather than evidence to acquit

505
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
I'm 43 years old

506
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,800
I have witnessed this for 43 years of my life

507
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Injustice

508
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
I cannot even compare to you the hurt

509
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,064
So according to Jeffrey that was round one and then just three years later

510
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
What car you get round to believe that this is the police Simpsons

511
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
White Ford Bronco there you see the police car

512
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,264
OJ Simpson in connection with the brutal slaying of his ex-wife Nicole in 25 year old Ron Goldie Reese

513
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Is blood a massive DNA evidence

514
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
Up to and inside the house in his bedroom and yet a predominantly black jury

515
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Boxing title action find a defendant or Owens All James Simpson not guilty of a crime of murder

516
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
You heard the verdict can we can we ask you reaction so well

517
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
How many black people table a white jury to ignore the law in the Rodney King case

518
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664
Many white people felt a largely black cherry

519
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
Done the same thing in acquitting OJ

520
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,344
He's guilty

521
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,160
According to Jeffrey these two cases

522
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
Together they sparked a national conversation

523
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
About Journal

524
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
The day after

525
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
The OJ Simpson

526
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,680
Furtick The Wall Street Journal writing the first page story

527
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Essentially

528
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
Arguing that in

529
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Inner cities throughout the

530
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Country

531
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
Black jurors were

532
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
Remarkably

533
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Acquittal

534
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
Another words according to the article there was a spike

535
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,040
In acquittals among black jurors in cases where the

536
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Defendant was also black

537
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
And the most likely explanation

538
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Is

539
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Kind of jury revolt

540
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,024
No Jeffrey actually argues that this idea of a jury Revolt was

541
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Stated in Part B

542
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Because

543
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
He said you can never really know if it's yours actually

544
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Hawaii

545
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
But sometimes

546
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,776
Will prosecutors would persuade a jury Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

547
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
But the drawers would still

548
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Find immaculate

549
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Georgetown law professor

550
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
Paul Butler who was

551
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
The prosecutor in DC the time says

552
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
That's exactly what

553
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Did that feel wrong

554
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,392
Only because

555
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
You know like

556
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,744
Every prosecutor I wanted another notch in my belt

557
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
So yeah it took me off but the reason they were doing this is because they didn't want to send another young black

558
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Black men to jail

559
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,008
Which Paul says was mostly what his job was

560
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,848
If you go to Criminal Court in DC you would think that white people

561
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Don't commit crimes

562
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
They're just out early absence

563
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
From the criminal court

564
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,808
Obviously that's not a reflection of the real world

565
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
And over the years day today

566
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,184
Locking up black people it takes a psychic toll

567
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
Paul says he started

568
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,304
Ask himself should I go to law school to put black people in prison

569
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
And for me

570
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
The answer became no

571
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,752
Well now a black law professor is urging black juries to use nullification

572
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,848
In their fight for racial Justice that let me smell only understand

573
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
What these African-American troops were doing in DC letting cases of non-violent crimes

574
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
20 Dwarfs

575
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,368
Did you let a guilty defendant off isn't that the same as really taking the Law into your own hands

576
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,696
Did absolutely is the same as taking the Law in your own hands

577
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Political protest

578
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Tilia MN

579
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
That one sort of seems to grow directly out of the racial

580
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,640
Mix of things that we're going on in both Rodney King and in the OJ case

581
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,272
As this was all bubbling up there is a group called the fully informed yours Association that started actually

582
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
In this tiny

583
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Butt hole of a town in Montana

584
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,256
With these like super libertarian

585
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Allowed

586
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Say that

587
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
And they started this

588
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,960
Group that was app that was basically advocating for jury nullification writing up pamphlets

589
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,872
Yeah sending out things eventually the internet comes along and attention to jury nullification just can't go through

590
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
There's claims that jurors in Atlanta in the mid-1990s started

591
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
Quitting sports like bookmaker

592
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
People defendants on a regular basis

593
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
Even though like in the past those cases it serves her missing a slam dunks and in the post-trial interviews jurors were saying that they

594
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Basalt

595
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,864
The reason was a Sigh No moral difference between betting on sports and playing like the Georgia Lottery

596
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
By the time you get medical marijuana initiatives around 1996

597
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
All sudden

598
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,360
It's become much more difficult for prosecutors to convince Teresa convicted in marijuana cases

599
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
So prosecutors are deciding not even to file

600
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Charges in those cases

601
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
It comes up in gun right cases during that time so you have like this

602
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Spasm of Interest

603
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
Largely because of these

604
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,160
Two kind of race-related Trials and then suddenly you have

605
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
It's kind of

606
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Spreading

607
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Serving all safe places near

608
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Brochure butchered rewrites

609
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,864
And in fact today what you're seeing is this kind of

610
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,704
Rising activism

611
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
Around getting the word out about jury nullification

612
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
What is happening at courthouses all across the United States in Philadelphia and Florida

613
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Name and who you are what you

614
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
What You Do lyrics Easton

615
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,416
A reporter to Denver to talk to this guy

616
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
My name is Mark

617
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,560
Teyana Taylor you spell that last name ianni

618
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
C e l l i

619
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
I am with an activist

620
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,960
For jury nullification

621
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:10,592
3 days a week old cold very hot rain or shine Mike would show up at the courthouse

622
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,688
And he's in other people

623
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
And they would just

624
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
Standard steps of the Court

625
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
And hand out these

626
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Pamphlet that basically say

627
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
Is your right as a juror to vote

628
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,488
Not guilty it's a bad law designed by bad politician

629
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
You know you have the right to vote

630
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Conscience to represent the conscious

631
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
The community had the right to judge the law

632
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,056
Right that's perfectly legal and that's how you get rid of bad law

633
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
None of these people various sorts

634
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Looks like they are very sore

635
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:51,040
You'll get the kind of guns rights people you get the Libertarians out west of occupy Denver

636
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
Like occupiers like Mark and you might get some like a racial Justice people who think they're not too many brown people in jail

637
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,512
Big tents

638
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,632
Is he a prosecutor he's got the LL Bean tote bag

639
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
Twin Rivers.

640
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,568
But then the thing is here as we get to the getting in trouble for it guys like Mark we got arrested here

641
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
Who handle this

642
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
And what's in front of courthouses

643
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
They sometimes get arrested

644
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,992
We will distribute the information and they came down

645
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,600
When they got seven of these right here from the fully informed jury Association

646
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
And we were handing them out to everybody

647
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,304
I get arrested for 7 class 5 felony is looking at 21 years in prison

648
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
Under what grounds

649
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
Almost always

650
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
Never says no once again

651
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Json is A Canticle cuz obviously

652
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,568
Not until they get usually get arrested for

653
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
For jury tampering

654
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
But then these cases of go and go get it

655
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Appealed and eventually

656
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,016
I don't think we found a case where this isn't true every single case

657
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,600
The brought the charges against thrown out because

658
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Free speech

659
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
We are now in a

660
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
1st Amendment

661
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Free speech

662
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
War

663
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
OK Google can you hear me

664
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
This is Julian haikal and he became kind of a jury nullification activist hero of sorts when he was arrested

665
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
Today in 2010 at the federal district court hearing

666
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Well I made 9 appearances at this courthouse and was arrested five times and he was about 78 years old

667
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,904
At this point he was just handing out flyers

668
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Yeah yeah you have like a deck

669
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
They're like a table set-up or are you not an information

670
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
And I just

671
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
As I got at bacova I I just

672
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,824
Pass out this one-page flyer people come up to you when they see Jerry information like are there.

673
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
More of the runaway

674
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
And he said show up at court houses like

675
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
Oliver place like a new jersey yet in Pennsylvania and like in Philadelphia and in Florida actually when we talked

676
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,696
He was in Orlando staying with his friend Mark and they were heading down to the local courthouse

677
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
The following Monday to urge people to know if I lost it on agree with basically because they see notification is a kind of a check on

678
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
On times when the government or a law goes

679
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Interview

680
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,240
Too far we have many cases like this that have shown it

681
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,336
When the slaves when the slaves were escaping from the south and going up north

682
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
People were running them up into Canada

683
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,760
And they were told that they had to return them after all the slaves were property

684
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
What that were guilty I was theft

685
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,136
When they didn't return these slaves probably the most

686
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Famous

687
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Example of jury nullification cases

688
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Square northern Jersey

689
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Even though they knew someone had harbored a slave and was

690
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
For guilty

691
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
They would just

692
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Refuse to commit

693
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,448
They don't do it that's how that's actually the most important

694
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,776
Jury nullification case that this country probably ever had

695
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
Is a just left us life I just heard about the Canada

696
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Violating the law out now

697
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
That's the point of having a jury

698
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
In fact Thomas Jefferson made the statement

699
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,856
The only thing that will save this country is the jury

700
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
The only thing

701
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,024
Hey by the way if you need to stop and take a drink of water don't

702
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
Don't hesitate to stop and cry a little

703
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Anyway let's go

704
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
You don't mind if I cry while we talk about this

705
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Just touches me pretty much

706
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
I mean what is it

707
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
Of course I don't mind if you cry I'm guess I'm curious what

708
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
What is it that's hitting you

709
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
In that way emotionally

710
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,880
I'm sorry I think about these cases that I just can't believe what's happening this country

711
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,720
I can't believe how corrupt this country has become

712
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
And you're seeing that corruption in people being locked away put away for things they shouldn't be put away for it

713
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Web for drugs

714
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
Do you know that

715
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
We now are the number one prison state in the world we have the highest percentage of prisoners in any country in the world

716
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
That's the United States of America

717
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,808
And of course 40% of the people are in there for a drug violation

718
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,928
Why does the government have any right to tell you what you can do with your body

719
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
It's the same thing for prostitution

720
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,072
Why should the government be able to tell you whether you can have sex

721
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
Or what you can't have sex

722
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,192
Or why you can smoke a cigarette or why you can't smoke a cigarette

723
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,776
Now I understand why the government tells you you can't shoot somebody else

724
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Give me that make sense

725
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
But if you want to shoot yourself

726
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Guess you're busy

727
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
Anyway and I'll tell you something

728
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
We're going to the car it's even though

729
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,344
To pass out this literature on Monday in Orlando that's why I'm down here

730
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
And

731
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,512
Then contact with a judge and he's been in contact with me yet he's informed me that if I show up I'll be arrested

732
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,352
What application are they probably have 50 or a hundred people

733
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Omaha

734
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
I hope along with me

735
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,288
Do you think I mean is that what you're doing at the courthouse are you going to be passing out the the jury pamphlet

736
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
That's exactly right

737
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
And the

738
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Judge has promised us that will be arrested

739
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,320
He said he's asking all my people to come with guns and shoot the cops to come after

740
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,392
You're not serious about that are you

741
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
I am serious

742
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Why me too baby. That would be the thing that you just said you understand why the government

743
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Stop someone for Jimmy.

744
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,656
Crosses a line. Comes a time when you got to stop

745
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,496
And I think that time as much as December 5th

746
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
It's got to be ended

747
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
You got to start killing the

748
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
The police and the guards and hopefully the judges

749
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Until they learn how to behave

750
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
That's not Justice either

751
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
The point is we've tried now for years

752
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
It doesn't seem to sink into them that is their job

753
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,952
To uphold a lot

754
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
Not to keep throwing people in prison

755
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
470 years I've been doing this

756
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
And this is the first time it ever occurred to me

757
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
That I would ever have to do such a thing

758
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
But

759
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
I can't help it

760
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,544
I have a hard time to reason why I should be arrested and taken away

761
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
After going to try and do it

762
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
I want them killed

763
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
But you realize couple

764
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
I have a hard time believing that you believe that that

765
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Desserts

766
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
Killing a quart

767
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Clarku

768
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
Has a family

769
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,792
They've been warned that I've sent them the letter I told him anybody that comes within 15 ft to me that's an officer of the Court

770
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,352
Where are the party of the Court

771
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
That there.

772
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
Be removed one way or the other

773
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
I've come to the conclusion that it has to be ended

774
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,616
Well I think that if you're in a position that ended on December 5th

775
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
I think that if you're in a

776
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Position of

777
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,600
Considering doing what you've just said you were considering doing

778
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,976
That that's that this to do anything it's only if they do so

779
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Well

780
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,584
Okay no matter what we have to do it's not going to happen again

781
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,936
Julian I'm going to interrupt you there in just say you know I think

782
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
I think we're probably best off just ending the conversation

783
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,616
Letting our microphone person go home and letting me in

784
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
It's not only my opinion.

785
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
My attention

786
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Yeah we hear you we got it

787
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
Okay thank you very much for having me

788
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Okay thank you

789
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Bye-bye

790
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Holy

791
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,560
Do you have to take stickers number

792
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
What happened

793
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
After that interview

794
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
Are the talented and

795
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
Esso after we hung up

796
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
We thought we had an obligation to

797
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,280
Call law enforcement down there because he

798
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,608
It sounded very much like he was making a direct threat with a time and a place

799
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
Until that Monday

800
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
He and his friend Mark

801
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
Did show up neither of them are armed

802
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
Need a hammer Market

803
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Been wanting to show

804
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,384
No it was just that nobody else showed up

805
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
And

806
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
The police say that

807
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Somebody who works at the court

808
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,808
And she told him that he had to leave that he was trespassing

809
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
He refused to leave

810
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
A police officer didn't also came

811
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
He was

812
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
Shouting things about

813
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,328
Shooting police officers at one point apparently he attempted to hit

814
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
But the court worker

815
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
But yeah

816
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
She didn't and

817
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
He was charged with threatening public workers

818
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Assault

819
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
And

820
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Trespassing

821
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
So what happened

822
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
So the charge for

823
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Threatening public workers

824
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
That was

825
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
Drop the prosecutors drop that charge

826
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,368
But he is still facing two misdemeanor charges of assault and trespassing

827
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Did

828
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
It when you're sitting there in that interview did that change

829
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
In any way you are

830
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Feelings

831
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
One way or the other about

832
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
Jury nullification

833
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
Cuz I kind of feel like it did for me little bit

834
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,216
My answer be really short

835
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
No

836
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Okay

837
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
Wino

838
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
I think he's just sort of

839
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Sounds like a

840
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
Angry frustrated

841
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Person

842
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
He's angry about

843
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
People not letting him

844
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,648
Talk about what he wants to talk about in front of a courthouse

845
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,328
I guess not I mean I did hear

846
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
When I was talking to him

847
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Lemon party

848
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
Because I was I've been thinking about jury nullification

849
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
What started the most heroic

850
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
Term just like this

851
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Chance to

852
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Stand up against an unjust law

853
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,271
This conversation just made me realize they can also it also like

854
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Can I guess

855
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Posted up with this really

856
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
Deeply anti-government

857
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Idea

858
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
You know like you talk to these people and you here

859
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,815
Arguments that sound like Burn It Down

860
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
That's the end of my problem

861
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Burn it down instinct

862
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
That's my would always serve at a distance

863
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
It felt this much much

864
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Closer

865
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Yeah that's kind of my head when I hear that tape

866
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,991
That's the strain and that's the kind of thinking that you bump into a lot

867
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
That I find

868
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
One of the most frightening things

869
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
I find it more frightening than almost any

870
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
What but what

871
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,511
That idea that like we the people should should be should be triumphant over everything

872
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
Like that if I find that to be a really scary

873
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
Ideas pops up I think like Tracy has a checks and balance kind of thing like of his system

874
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,079
We have a legislative branch passes laws so yeah the laws are

875
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
What are you looking to see you tour

876
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
Or circumstance

877
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Change

878
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,575
Are you find out a consequence of the law if you know people in One race are constantly going to jail during race on it or getting electrocuted

879
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
And then you get these

880
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:12,511
You get these ordinary people walking into these participation points and you know what

881
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Doesn't feel right

882
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
It's just wrong

883
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
And that's like

884
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,655
If you don't have that then the legislators don't get that little creek

885
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
In their little bubble

886
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,311
Totally hear you I mean I've never advocate for going along with a bad law

887
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
I think you are

888
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
Yeah right with that loss

889
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
But there's something

890
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,991
Potentially corrosive about saying to a person

891
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
You can judge

892
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Just negate the law

893
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
Think about all them times when white juries in the South refused

894
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
To convict

895
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
People of

896
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Horrible thing

897
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
You know it

898
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
It's like that

899
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,911
I mean that's that's absolutely jury nullification and that's like that is that is the history of life

900
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Like post-reconstruction

901
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
South you know

902
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,287
Yeah but you can make those same arguments on the other side

903
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,871
Think about what yours did during the Civil Rights Movement

904
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,223
This is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor speaking at NYU in

905
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
10 mm

906
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
If it weren't for jury nullification

907
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,367
We would have many civil rights

908
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,719
Individuals who would be convicted felons or otherwise

909
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,279
Four things that today we think

910
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Are protected by

911
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
The First Amendment

912
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
There is a place

913
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
I think

914
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,263
Forgery notification finding the balance of that

915
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,103
And the role that a judge should or should not play

916
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,407
Our forefathers did not believe

917
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,991
The tree is necessarily always got it right

918
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
But it was I think what they believe is that

919
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,111
The jury getting wrong

920
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Was better than the Crown getting it

921
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,143
It goes at some fundamental level 2

922
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
How we want as a people to be governor

923
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,335
Do we want to be governed by experts we want to be governed by each other

924
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
What power do we want

925
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
Each of us to have over the other one

926
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,247
This is what this question really comes down

927
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,599
This is once again I'll install legal editor at the WIC show more

928
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,439
The older I get the more comfortable I become with the idea

929
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Of

930
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
An unelected

931
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
White man

932
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
Sitting in judicial robes

933
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Deciding

934
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
As opposed to

935
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
12 random

936
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Jerk-off from the

937
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,567
And I say that knowing full well that that is a horribly elitist

938
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Terrible for that reason

939
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Listen to the

940
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,783
We have it so puts hand in concentrate power in

941
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
2

942
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Mostly white hands

943
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,439
It cost to get into the system

944
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
When

945
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,791
We're saying that one of the only benefits of jury nullification

946
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
Is to be a check on the side

947
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,167
If you look at it only from the perspective

948
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Then

949
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Jury nullification

950
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Seems like

951
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
A great way to protest

952
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,967
But I'm kind of I've I've started to look at things more From perspective

953
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
Which victims are getting Justice in which victims are

954
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
I'm not

955
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
What I see is

956
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Juries nullifying

957
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Cases

958
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
When the victim is of color

959
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Or when the victim is a woman

960
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
I try bringing rape case

961
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Try bringing a date rape

962
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Try it

963
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
It's really hard

964
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
And what reasons why sweetheart is the jury

965
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Is the jury sitting there is talk about

966
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,663
She was asking for it talk about what was she wearing talk about

967
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,503
How why was he out that late any damn way right

968
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Jury

969
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,343
Doing that to the woman as much as any as any other

970
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Part of the system

971
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
So when I think about it from the perspective of the victim

972
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
And how is

973
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
What are the Avenues of Justice

974
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
For the Vic

975
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,631
If you're a person of color if you're a minority if you're an other

976
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
I feel like the jury makes it very hard for you as the victim to get

977
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,031
I feel better about the judge not

978
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,103
Hearing if the people that you shot happened to be white or blue

979
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
A jury cares

980
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,295
If you can't connect the cop when you know we did it when you saw him doing you can't convict

981
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,855
The cop who shot Walter Scott you can't convict

982
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,647
Can't even indict the cop

983
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
Who choked Eric Garner to death in broad daylight

984
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
That

985
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
Tatsumi

986
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,815
Requires a much more dress

987
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Stick wreath

988
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
That's how we do things in this

989
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
Anthony the

990
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
First people to go

991
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
Have to be these

992
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Gdb

993
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
I find that really persuade

994
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
I don't

995
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
And a nice

996
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,295
You know maybe that's because I served on a bunch of juries I've been on them

997
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,855
6 now and

998
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,975
Time and again been amazed at one time I was in a murder case

999
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Some men have been accused of stabbing a woman

1000
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,351
22 * she died on the staircase

1001
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
And

1002
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,727
The four women in any New York they just picked a person who speaks first becomes the

1003
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
The four the four person

1004
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
She came

1005
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
And she sat down to look

1006
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
How many of you noticed like the

1007
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Defendant's lawyer was asleep a lot of

1008
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,223
Every hand when I seen this

1009
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
Here's what I want you to do

1010
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Let's

1011
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,111
Let's go back over everything that we know

1012
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Essentially retry the case

1013
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
We we we actually

1014
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
We went we went

1015
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,631
Together to every bit of it looking for some damned out somewhere

1016
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:44,031
We staged the stabbing we went back over the distances where the pack with the guy have gotten from here to there and data

1017
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
I'm out of time I live in the neighborhood I don't think you can maybe you can maybe can't

1018
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
We basically

1019
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,759
Did the job of the court all over again ourselves and when we were done

1020
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
So Calif

1021
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Vote now

1022
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,927
And when it became clear to the four women that we were going to connect

1023
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Cuz she was counting the votes in

1024
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
And finally the 12th vote

1025
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
To convey

1026
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
She

1027
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Just shorter than her

1028
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Her chair so

1029
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
When she got off at your sexy

1030
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
What's smaller than when you're sitting right

1031
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
She asked us all the hold hands

1032
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,847
We just spent five days we've been sequestered in a hole

1033
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Hotel

1034
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Each of us have

1035
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Policeman guarding us because we was

1036
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Violence

1037
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:28,063
So we all standing on TV she has to hold hands and then she looks up at the

1038
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Ceiling

1039
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,623
It's one of those ordinary rooms

1040
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
And she's addresses

1041
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
The

1042
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Cu

1043
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
One who's killed

1044
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
And she says

1045
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
She says we have spent the last few days

1046
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,143
Trying to do something that is just

1047
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
And we know you were there you died

1048
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
His hands or didn't

1049
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
We decided that you did

1050
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
And we hope

1051
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
And we pray

1052
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
Physicist

1053
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
It works

1054
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
When you are getting just

1055
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
She said God bless

1056
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Bless America

1057
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
That's amazing

1058
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:09,535
Even though I think you're you're expressing that kind of faith in democracy that it's

1059
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
I think it's in shorts

1060
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071

Earlier this year and we just want to say what a pleasure it was

1074
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Talk to her and Hell

1075
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
