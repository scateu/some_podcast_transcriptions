1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radiolab wnyc

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
You ready yes

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,624
Feeling feeling I'm old work I'm feeling full of valuable in that Spirit on Jedi

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,256
Which is Radiolab different stories to try to put a dollar value mouganis okay

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
$1000000 $7

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
Kendo

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Fun things

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168
It seemed priceless

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,728
Priceless priceless

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
Okay so start bring on the pressure

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
To tell it to

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,992
Sorry we can start the show with a story from our producer Molly Webster

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
So we might actually want to rename Ali Wong sister

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,672
Because she said she recently got herself into some serious numero sizing

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,768
Actually didn't start as a wonky thing it starts at 2 with some medical journal

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
So that was that was interesting because it was some of the most

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
Poetic writing I've seen out of doctors

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Ever

22
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
One Journal article said like what would one more month mean to a 37 year old mother who has

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
For children

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,064
Or what would one more month mean if you are a 67 year-old who's about to go traveling around the world

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
People were just kind of like drifting these questions out there

26
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
All these questions seem to circle around

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
The seemingly simple story of the pricing of a drug

28
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Cancer

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
And the story

30
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,960
If you really want to tell it from the beginning it begins with this guy named Leonard

31
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Leonard saltz I'm a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center witches here New York

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
It's one of the largest cancer centers in the country we have

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
17 doctors here who

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Curry College

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Just for colon cancer

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Very large number

37
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
It's a huge Hospital

38
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
And one of the things Leonard's been noticing in the last

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Decade

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:11,584
Is cancer drug prices have just gone through the roof I mean we have drugs out there that are many hundreds of dollars

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Really yeah just wait

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Let's see where's the start it starts

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
It's June in 2012

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,824
Leonard saltz is at a conference and at this conference is

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Is a pharmaceutical company called Santa Fe

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
And they

47
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Give a presentation about a new drug that they

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
A drug called zaltrap and zell trap

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Is a drug that

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Without getting into the science too much

51
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Target

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
The blood supply to the tumor

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
Cut off the blood supply which means a tumor

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
That's that's the

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Scientific iPod

56
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,424
The new drug is presented and they like present the data and they showed

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
That the

58
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Survival difference

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
Between the people who got soundtrack in the people

60
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
Was 1.4 month

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
42 days

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,152
In other words if you take this drug

63
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
You could get

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
42 more days of life

65
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
On average

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:05,856
Which means you could get three more days you could get no days you could get 42 or you could live another 3 years

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
242 days

68
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
Don't please I could show you some graphs have been put up at meetings that show

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Survival curves

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Calculate it out

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
To two decimal places in terms of months

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm look at the

73
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
100 of a month

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
A hundred a month that's a little over 7 hours

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Free

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Amusing acted why would you why would you

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
It's pseudo precision

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Pseudobursa

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
Anyways after the conference

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,880
The FDA approves the drug and basically once the FDA approves a drug

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,000
Public insurance has to take it and then the private insurance companies just follow suit

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Which means

83
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
You get prescribed the drug and people pay

84
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
What is the drug cost

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
That's the thing it cause

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
Roughly 3004

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Three-month course

88
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Soap

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
Stew Leonard's like wow that is expensive

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,224
And there was already another drug on the market did the same thing and it cost half as much

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,832
To put that in context this is just one drug that's $11,000 a month

92
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
A normal cancer patient might take dozens of drugs there are anti-nausea medicines that are sometimes used to that

93
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,863
Getting in the range of 90 to $100 a tablet you take a tablet once a day for 3 days

94
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,263
One needs growth factors to help support the white blood cell count which is sometimes need and chemo those can be five

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
$1,000 every two to three weeks if you need antibiotics to treat infections those aren't cheap and and then you need a pharmacist

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
Prepare their labor-intensive need tubing and equipment and needles to give it and he trained nurses to administer if you need to talk

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
To take care of the patient and don't forget there's a cost for a CAT scan or MRI and and then of course someone's got to pay for the realest

98
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
State the heat in the lights

99
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
None of those prices are figured into it

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
I'm just giving you

101
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
The

102
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Cost of the truck

103
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
So Leonard calls up one of his colleagues

104
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
My name is Peter ba

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,663
I'm a physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Peter the number cruncher of the group he does the statistical analysis

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
I don't know what the cost of care

107
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
And then grabbed him and ran him through

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,623
And we walked through the out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Medicare beneficiaries

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
If they don't have additional insurance

111
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:24,607
20 cents of every dollar they pay out-of-pocket have hit him because he realize for Medicare patients

112
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,423
They be paying something like $2,000

113
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Out-of-pocket every month

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
For justice truck 2200 if I remember the number correctly

115
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
For a lot of Medicare patients

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
All of their money

117
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Nevermind other drugs

118
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
That

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
When I thought we should go public with it

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
Memorial Sloan-Kettering they decide to boycott

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
This truck

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Now

123
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Is that

124
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
I mean I'm just stopping you because

125
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,655
When you guys made that decision was that that feels like a big deal it did feel like a big deal and it felt like a big enough deal that

126
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
We decided to write

127
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
The op-ed piece in the New York Times

128
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
They write an op-ed in the times that basically says look this is crazy $11,000 a month for a drug that made

129
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
Baby gives you 42 more days of life is that worth it

130
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
Little less than a month after the op-ed piece came out

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,623
The company that makes eltropy went to individual doctor's office

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Sent representatives and said

133
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
We are offering a 50% discount

134
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Because

135
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Price in half just like that

136
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
Yep Nationwide or like just in this area

137
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
It was sort of in

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
We reached out to Santa Fe to talk about the prices out rap and they decline to comment

139
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,943
In a statement that they released when this holes out that thing happened

140
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
They said that

141
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
They incur so many costs

142
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,855
For researching and developing and bringing a drug to Market

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
But that is what the pricing is

144
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
Leonard doesn't disagree we need these companies

145
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
They're the ones developing the truck

146
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,607
Which aren't easy to develop I mean Leonard gave us just one example

147
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
If we talk about colon care

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
He says four years there was only one drug on the market

149
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Called 5-fu

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,567
5-fu was patented in August of 1957

151
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
It was from 1957

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Until 1996

153
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
That a second drug came along

154
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
That's how long it takes to develop a good

155
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
Drug or that interim that were over 70 drugs that were tried and failed

156
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,743
Didn't like I don't get enough credit cuz that just astounded me it's very very hard

157
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,119
And that according to Leonard is one of the reasons why prices are just going to keep going up

158
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
But

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Sooner or later this system

160
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Is going to fall apart

161
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
And it would point

162
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
The society say

163
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
There isn't an infinite number of dollars

164
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
We can commit to our Healthcare System

165
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
It's funny because I have an interesting reaction to the word Society

166
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Salveson I thought likewise

167
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,183
Not not like a dino crazy death panel white but

168
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
I thought y

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,559
Why is society involved in my conversation

170
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
With my doctor about

171
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
If I want to take this drug that may give me

172
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Another month and a half of life

173
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Why is society involved

174
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Cuz you're not paying

175
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Unless

176
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
You have

177
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
Hidden resources I'm aware of probably couldn't afford

178
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
10 to $15,000 a month

179
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Someone else

180
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Obviously he says it's your insurance

181
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,439
Say you're part of a policy that has 1000 members

182
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Let's say that the premium

183
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
For that

184
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Is

185
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
$100

186
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
So we had $100

187
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Thousand people

188
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
We got to come down and out

189
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Okay can we now have $100,000

190
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
To take care of that thousand people

191
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,151
Whatever Matt time if now one person

192
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Comes up with a healthcare cost let's say it's for a month

193
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
That is

194
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
$100,000 in that month

195
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Everybody else is in trouble

196
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
So

197
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
They write this op-ed

198
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Saying my prices are too high in the drugs are not

199
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,399
Decorate and sort of the next like notable wave is

200
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
There was this there's this journal called

201
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,823
Blood which is really big to anybody that works in a community that Hamlet called blood

202
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
How did we not know about this we make the blood show

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,295
Just kept it in here Journal called blood which is basically like

204
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,647
The journal for anybody that works in a field that has to do with blood

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
What happens is like

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
100 doctors get together and they

207
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Cosine and editorial

208
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Which basically says

209
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,935
I totally agree with everything you guys are saying but we haven't even bigger issue

210
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
You know was out rap you're talkin about an expensive drug

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Maybe doesn't really do that much

212
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
It's kind of easy even though I had never been done before

213
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
To say we're not going to use this

214
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
What all of these

215
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Doctors in the blood editorial or saying

216
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
What do you do when you have a really

217
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Expensive drug

218
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
It's really really good

219
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
I could drag you actually want

220
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
It is that like a like a one day in the future we will face is going to question now today

221
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
The most important new medicine approved this year everyone I talked to pointed me to this new drug sovaldi

222
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:25,151
Known as the sovaldi

223
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
Sovaldi came on the market last

224
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
December 5th December 2013

225
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
That's correct

226
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
This is Bruce small I'm the editor of Commonwealth magazine

227
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
He's written about sovaldi and here's the basic story right

228
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
It is a drug that treats

229
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Hepatitis

230
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
Which is caused by a virus and the disease itself

231
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Goes to work on your liver

232
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
It inflames it

233
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,311
It's cars that can cause liver cancer cirrhosis that can be fatal

234
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,431
And for the longest time the treatments that they had just really weren't that great or they just had

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Ratchet side of

236
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
But along comes to Vault

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
And it's one pill 12 weeks

238
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
To take it with some other antiviral meds it is a super simple treatment option

239
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
And the side effects are very minimal

240
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Like this it was like kind of

241
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Like the savior

242
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
And so a lot of doctors start

243
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
Describe it in the first half

244
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
2004

245
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
14

246
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
70000

247
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
The country in the United

248
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
And it had a 95%

249
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Rate of

250
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Sure

251
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
In other words

252
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Cow

253
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
That's very big

254
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
In fitting with our story this drug

255
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Cost $1,000

256
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
The pill

257
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,511
For like one one pill that I take one a day

258
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:54,751
Which as you can imagine and angered a lot of people with hep C in total it costs

259
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
$84,000

260
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
And if you think about the fact that in

261
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:04,735
2014 we know at least 70000 people got this drug you're starting to talk about

262
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
Serious money I just want to say that I

263
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,207
I just X doubt 70000 * 84000

264
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
And I got something with seven zeros in it

265
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
588 and then there's seven zeros which is like

266
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Abbott 5 billion dollars

267
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Yes

268
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
The big question is how States will pay

269
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
For what could be upwards of until we have a situation where

270
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
States are basically having to ration is currently are requiring

271
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Some liver damage

272
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,879
Before you can take the drug similar restrictions are happening in other states

273
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
Florida happening in Oregon Illinois

274
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
And then there's Arizona out of the entire state

275
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
Public insurance only approves 180 people for treat

276
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
Adjust 180 just 180

277
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
Now when I talk to a representative of the company that makes the drug

278
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Greg Alton jacket vice president for

279
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Corporate and medical Affairs for Gilead Sciences

280
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
He says you got to keep in mind

281
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
This is not a chronic care situation this is a sure actually curing a person of a disease we're talkin

282
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
In about

283
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
12 weeks of therapy

284
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
Period that's it and you're done and you cared so

285
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
So he says

286
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,863
This is a one-time deal was like one time $84,000

287
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,703
And then you're done think about all the years you live without having an illness

288
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,311
Then you'll see 20 year. The savings that will accrue to the system

289
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
By having a patient cured of hepatitis C

290
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
He also said it's important to understand

291
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,247
That every hepatitis C suffer is not going to hit

292
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
System

293
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
At the same time so all of the

294
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Cost

295
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Is spread out right

296
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
Wichita totally true but I think there's like the bigger picture here

297
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,815
I Am Bruce pointed out to it's sort of like a precursor of what could

298
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Come because

299
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
These companies

300
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Are developing drugs all the time what if

301
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,031
If you could get a drug but it was very expensive to treat diabetes

302
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
And then you're talking tens of millions of

303
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Enormous segment of the population

304
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
Even if just a fraction of them want a drug that's $1,000 per day

305
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
It's practically our entire us budget what do you do in that case

306
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
A drug comes along like that

307
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
And throws everything out of whack

308
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
This is the part where I really sort of got hooked in where it's like

309
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
How do you answer this question is it that

310
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,239
You know at a certain point you just draw a line and you say

311
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Beyond this point

312
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
We're not paying

313
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
But beyond what

314
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Exactly I think that's the hard part

315
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,503
How good does a treatment have to be

316
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
For you to say this is worth the price that it's been said I don't think we have rejected out of hand foot I got into this

317
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,023
In the case of soundtrack they said alright 42 days that much money we're not going to do it

318
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
But would it have been different if it was 50 days

319
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
100

320
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,263
Is that enough I'm sure you want to be talking in years but I guess the question is like what would be a mall is there a magic line for you

321
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
If I

322
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
This is it

323
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,479
I can't personally determinate for everybody

324
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
I wouldn't presume to try

325
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
But

326
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Ultimately as a society

327
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Going to have to reach

328
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
An understanding of what that cut point is

329
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Because we can't afford not to

330
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,911
And the question is sort of bubbles out of this conversation is what is one more year or one more month or what

331
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
One more day of life worse

332
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Are we going to pay $1,000 for an extra day of life

333
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,895
But what about $100,000 reduction of life people like to say yeah so what's the value of a human life

334
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,967
The answer is boy that's a complicated question

335
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
They're really important one

336
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Because

337
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Nobody thinks it's infinitely

338
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
He said that

339
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
And I was like okay

340
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Sub-Zero and it's not instant

341
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
Is there an answer like in the middle and so

342
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
I started looking around

343
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
I guess I was wondering if anyone actually thought about this

344
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,799
Since I started looking around what I realized was at the World Health Organization

345
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Actually

346
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
I mean I guess they almost have a number but it's a number per country they have the recommendation that that country spend

347
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,111
Can I get gobbledygook eat but just bear with me the country spend one two three times

348
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
The GDP

349
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Per capita which is like

350
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
The gross domestic product per individual

351
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Go to take the entire

352
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:39,167
Fat ball of money that is in a country and divided / individual / the individuals and then you spend one two three

353
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Times that on

354
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
When were Goodyear

355
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Movies that be for us

356
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,359
Search for the us if that's about fifty to a hundred fifty thousand

357
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Interesting

358
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Is that does that have any any teeth

359
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,831
That recommendation really doesn't have any teeth but it has teeth in the sense that

360
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
Doctors in the US

361
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,463
Going to start using this who number to evaluate

362
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Medical Treatments

363
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
For Cardiology

364
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
They said they were going to do this in a paper and it was kind of very quiet very subtle

365
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
But in other countries

366
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
This conversation

367
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
Is very loud actually it happens at the government level

368
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
They're also passing out surveys with her asking

369
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Citizens what is your limit on how much

370
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
You want to spend on one more good year of life

371
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
And they did not hear

372
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Far as I know no

373
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Because

374
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Because the last time we tried to talk about cost in medicine it ended up in the hole death

375
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Death panels or so-called death panels thing

376
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
I don't know I just wondered right into the mess of it hey Times Square if I actually tried to go out

377
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
A very basic way

378
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
How would people respond

379
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:00,063
Excuse me can I ask you a question what is a year of life worth

380
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
But a question it was really surprised at how

381
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Seriously people took the question

382
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
What is a year of life worth

383
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
That was the first thing I noticed

384
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Then the next thing was

385
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
No one to answer the question until I had answered like a million questions of there

386
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Where do I get that year do I get it at the beginning and middle or the end how would I spend that you have life

387
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Goodyear's life depends is like a pie in the sky kind of answer they wanted to know would they be emotionally happy

388
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
Loan with friends or family where did they get the money they borrow the money they have to pay the money back where they dying was it in

389
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
Emergency or other people also trying to get money at the same time because then there'd be like a rush on the money in America

390
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
So interesting

391
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Did you actually ever end up getting

392
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Numbers

393
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
I did get numbers but they were

394
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
10 - $15,000

395
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
Stop 13th $7 all over the place

396
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
$44,000

397
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,975
Interesting one woman said 10 million million dollars for a year

398
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
Irresponsible you asking me about my personal choice not about a public

399
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,703
Why do you have any way of parsing office

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
No

401
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,335
I really honestly don't like I think my biggest takeaway was like no one punched me

402
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
Switch

403
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
Which makes me feel as if people are ready

404
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Not ready but willing

405
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
But I also realize that

406
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
I kept talking about things and

407
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
I just want to

408
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
To be in the room with page

409
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Play Patience in the room with me because it was like we're all having this conversation that

410
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
Eventually we'll all be patients I guess but

411
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
We're also

412
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
Having this conversation around

413
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,031
Like a group of people that weren't ever present like they're not a conferences or not in

414
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Research articles

415
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
And so that was when I started talking to Paige

416
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Wow

417
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
I guess what is 42 days

418
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,831
What is 42 days mean in the sense of

419
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Is that something that you pay 50

420
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
$1,000

421
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
If you were

422
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
I mean of course you would

423
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
It's like I haven't even asked the question but I don't know I know I think it's a good question I think

424
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
Ethically it would be to the good of patients

425
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
And doctors

426
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,823
To have this conversation this is Susan

427
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Susan gubar Rider of

428
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
The living with cancer blog

429
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
Did the New York Times back in 2008 Susan went to the doctor

430
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
She hasn't been feeling well for a while they thought it was some sort of foul issue but then the doctor walked into the room and said she had

431
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Advanced stage ovarian cancer

432
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,791
Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at ale

433
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Stage and

434
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
It's it's basically

435
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Incurable

436
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
It can be handled it can be managed at

437
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
Can be kept at Bay and

438
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
Longer periods of time now we hope

439
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,175
But you're given a diagnosis of 3 to 5 years

440
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
That is

441
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,807
You go from having unlimited time in your mind to

442
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Three to five years in like a docker

443
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
Yeah it's it's it's a big shock

444
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
You said Ventura Zone

445
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Well you're not quite aware of what

446
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
You doing

447
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
That day the day she was diagnosed she was told

448
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Pack a bag get in the car and drive to Indianapolis

449
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
You need surgery now

450
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,456
So I went to the next day to Indianapolis and the day after that I had to do bulking surgery which takes out the

451
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
The ovaries and the

452
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,600
Uterus in the Fallopian tubes in the spleen and sometimes the cervix

453
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,952
Sometimes the appendix in holy times the bowel and are you serious

454
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Yeah it's called the mother of all surgery

455
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
And then just like that

456
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
Shooting multiple rounds

457
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
Chemo chemicals that are used

458
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
They destroy all quick-growing cell

459
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
So for example you have no hair

460
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
No eyebrows no eyelashes that you know

461
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,432
You also can I got terrible sores in my mouth

462
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,808
I have no idea why but I know this happens to other people but yeah the other thing is this extreme

463
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
Fatigue

464
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
And Susan who writes for a living couldn't even read

465
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,488
I would look at a page and think that I turned a page

466
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
Chemotherapy it really is toxic

467
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
To the spirit

468
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
To the heart to the mind

469
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
Just the normal aspects of Life feel polluted

470
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Have you ever had to think about

471
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Cost

472
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
I was never

473
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
Formed of the cost of

474
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Any drug

475
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Or any

476
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Procedure I was

477
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,440
Which really makes me think about how Mass

478
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
These costs are would you

479
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,864
Want to be thinking about cost while you're going through it or is it better to just

480
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Stay here your treatment options

481
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Visa statistical outcomes

482
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Like

483
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Pick one

484
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
And then we'll deal with it on the other

485
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
I think there's an

486
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Kind of

487
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:16,736
Unspoken agreement among everyone that the insurance company or Medicare is going to pay

488
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
And if it's the government that means our grandchildren

489
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Are going to end up paying

490
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
For all of this

491
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Money so yes I guess to answer your question I think it would be healthier to know what

492
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Distance Quest on the other hand I have to say is

493
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Patient

494
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,656
I was so traumatized I'm not sure I could have taken that information in

495
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
I was thinking about your what what is worth

496
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
What's it worth

497
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
A title and I was thinking that

498
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
The American individualistic

499
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Optimistic

500
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
Response would be well whatever it takes

501
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Whatever it takes

502
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
Life is worth it whatever it takes

503
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
But whatever it takes

504
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Will not cure my cancer

505
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
So I think this question changes

506
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
When you have incurable

507
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,448
It becomes a different question which is one is enough

508
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Enough

509
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
She said that when is enough enough

510
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,456
I was just I don't know that we are ready to say there's one magic

511
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
Thrown back to this conversation that I had with Leonard saltz where he was saying that we have to look at everything in terms

512
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
Of value

513
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,232
You need to think deeply about the kind of life you want to live

514
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
It's not just about

515
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
How many days

516
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
It's about what kind of

517
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
Daiso if you told me

518
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
But there was something that gave 72

519
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,520
Day survival benefit but it makes people feel nauseous for most of the time

520
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,128
Is that worth it when were trying to draw this line as a society

521
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Before we figure out what we're willing to

522
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Pee-Wee have

523
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Think about what

524
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
We are

525
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Paying for

526
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah I don't think we know what we're Susan

527
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,952
He has six years ago she decided that she was going to get chemotherapy be

528
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Because

529
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
In part it would be more time with her daughter

530
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Yeah

531
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
And suddenly

532
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
It's worth it

533
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Yeah

534
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
But I think we changed by the treatment to

535
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
For now Susan's cancer is

536
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Basically under control

537
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
Because she's on this new drug

538
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
422 years and now months

539
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
And I am counting has been alive without a recurrence without the key

540
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Cancer growing

541
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,184
By taking these pills everyday

542
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,328
I take them at home they're not infused in the hospital through my veins

543
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
They're just pills

544
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
And it's made last

545
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Few years

546
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Remarkably

547
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Normal light

548
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
The new Norm

549
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
But when these drugs stop working in

550
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
I've been told they will stop

551
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Working

552
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
I'm not sure I would want to go back to chemotherapy

553
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,976
But I suspect I don't know until I get there

554
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688

And I'm here because I need your help

571
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,128
This summer

572
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
And I request

573
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

574
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:38,880
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments child brilliant

575
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,232
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

576
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
It just means you lean back and say whoa

577
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
How do they do that

578
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
Maybe it was the moment that I

579
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,216
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

580
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,520
Or maybe the kid was a piano

581
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,128
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

582
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,736
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

583
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
We're interested in the

584
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Epic moments where

585
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,672
Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

586
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232

594
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
This is a totally different take

595
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Matt kielty

596
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560

Slightly different story about worth

598
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
Story

599
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
It rather than being about how much we value our own lives

600
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
About how much we value someone else

601
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Mince tarts

602
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
BuzzFeed writer Gregory Johnson

Well wedding wedding drone strike is that

605
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,624

December 12th 2013

608
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Early that morning

609
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
In small village group of guys

610
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Roughly

611
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,728
50 to 60 people in a soon-to-be married man

612
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264

His name is Abdullah Muhammad LTZ

618
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,344
We had spoke to him through an interpreter in Yemen

619
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Do to me

620
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
It was his neighbor

621
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,024
Who is the groom to be married that day

622
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
The bright Cellars

They got the bride and just a few of her Bridal attendants a few females and they start driving back to

627
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Grimm's Village

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
The actual wedding ceremony

629
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Melt

630
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Do said that ever since they left that morning

631
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Lunch

632
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
All day long

633
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
They heard this

634
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
Humming the sort of metallic worrying this

635
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Metallic thumping overhead no one of the conflict

636
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
See it but

637
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Anywhere

638
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
Address

639
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Sound sound

640
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Hearing all the day

641
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,848
Nothing new for people in rural parts of Yemen by this point they don't think anything of it common to hear those sounds

642
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah it's usually held there

643
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
So

644
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Try me

645
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
Basically if you can imagine it there

646
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
Serta winding through these Waters these desert mountains

647
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Places

648
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
The road

649
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,208
He said they're all strung out on this

650
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Ride it out little dirt track

651
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,840
11 cars single file

652
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Up near the top of the

653
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
Cliff where they'll slow down and started the

654
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Bunched together

655
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Apparently

656
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Model cars that got in a flat

657
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104

Got back in their car

660
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Right at that moment

661
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
The sound

662
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Somehow

663
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
And then the missiles * 4

664
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,816
In quick succession the shrapnel is just flying everywhere

665
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
In a blink

666
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Dover

667
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
People are trying to figure out what has happened all the screaming

668
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
There's fires that are burning

669
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
Anne Abdullah

Two boys and one girl

686
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848

00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
You got a fast car

689
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
End

690
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
Stumble back for the 4th

691
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Define the Sun

692
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Just next to the car

693
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Victorious

694
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
He died

695
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Oh yeah

696
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
No he didn't

697
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
I'm just you looked at

698
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Passed away

699
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
So

700
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
It turns out that there are 12 dead

701
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,064
And typically what happens in Yemen is that as soon as someone is killed their very very very shortly thereafter

702
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
What happens here is something different

703
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
The people in the Convoy

704
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Take the bodies

705
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Of the Dead

706
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
And they take them back to read the

707
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
This big town near where the Drone strike occurred

708
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
There's a video I have

709
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,264
It's what you're hearing Ricci cement take these 12 dead bodies

710
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,592
And a line them up in the street on this

711
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,176
Bright blue tarp and they sort of a wrap them in these cheap blank

712
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,552
And so there's this huge crowd that just gathers around 2

713
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
Stare at these dead bodies who are laid out in the

714
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,256
And at a certain point this very tiny very very leathery old yemeni who sort of

715
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Holding onto the back of a

716
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
Pick up with one arm stands over the Dead

717
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,472
Sort of swing over the bodies and just lecturing the crowd on what happened he's

718
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
Screaming at them and so

719
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
You can hear his voice

720
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
Talk to Bill horse

721
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,296
Any screening in American drone killed these it was a massacre

722
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
People are on their way to a wedding

723
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Why did this happen

724
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Why were they kill

725
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Why did they target this

726
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
This Convoy

727
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Well according to the US

728
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
Did received Intel that

729
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
On that day in this Convoy

730
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Al Qaeda operative

731
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,784
Name Sookie or badani apparently have been plenty of attacks

732
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Mexican to us

733
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
That's why they took the shot

734
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
And in fact they say that he was wounded in this

735
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
In this wedding Convoy

736
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Strike

737
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
And do we have any reason

738
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
2

739
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Believe that

740
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
I have no reason to believe it

741
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
Greg spent weeks in Yemen.

742
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
Two survivors of the Drone strike talk to people who are there no one knows the

743
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
The sky

744
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,104
Brakes at the guy isn't really a member of either the tribes that were involved in the wedding

745
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
And so to him

746
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,688
It makes no sense that he would be there

747
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
To him this was

748
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Terrible mistake

749
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,624
But what really got me interested in Craig's reporting

750
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,488
Which can be done buzzfeed.com highly recommended question of like

751
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
What

752
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
The US did next

753
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
The question is like

754
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,192
What do you do in this case how do you repair something like this

755
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,776
We have two totally different cultures with two different traditions

756
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
How do you find a way

757
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,128
To try to make this right

758
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
I mean historically

759
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,040
Do soldiers have an obligation to repair

760
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
No

761
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
There's no obligation

762
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,440
But what happened is we've actually

763
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
He created an obligation for ourselves

764
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,888
Americans have yeah yeah this has a really long history of History that's illegal

765
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Legally yeah yeah a legal history

766
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,776
And they're said there's a great law professor at Yale

767
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
His last name is

768
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Is Witt

769
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
John Wick

770
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
That's me

771
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
We ended up tracking down John Witt

772
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,064
Talk about how the US first started to try to right the wrongs

773
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
In war so what is the

774
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Foundation

775
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Story of Aldi

776
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
That start

777
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Will General

778
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Pershing World War

779
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
1917

780
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
Caldwell

781
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Great War ramps up

782
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
So we start shipping young men

783
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Minions Malta

784
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
Physically France was a man

785
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Name John Jay

786
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Commander of

787
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
American forces on the Western Front

788
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Mr Man

789
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,088
Pencil mustache bit of a Maverick single person is your nickname

790
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Blackjack

791
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
And when he first arrives in France with the troops

792
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,536
Beginner bike at Pershing she's got this problem which is what he has Jeeps

793
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Ship to France

794
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Man by armor

795
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
World War 1

796
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
The first war in which

797
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
The US

798
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
Shipping a lot of automobile

799
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
More than a hundred thousand

800
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,080
For the soldiers to drive cars trucks

801
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,176
Cheap Jeeps are really great they got his men from one place to another Perry

802
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
Yenta

803
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,552
I also run into French Farmers chickens

804
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Cows

805
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Children sometimes just

806
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Farmers themselves

807
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,000
These random collisions over there no roads I'm going to bet there was some of ever

808
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,608
Sometimes it was probably just ordinary car accidents in sometimes No Doubt

809
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
A little French wine was in

810
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
This is precious problem

811
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Eastern Runner

812
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Overseas

813
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
And it wasn't any good

814
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
For him to have

815
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Grumpy civilians at his rear

816
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
And tell her she has an idea

817
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
Which actually bars in the bread

818
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
And that is

819
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
He will use

820
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Money

821
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Right or wrong

822
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
Once we go to the Congress and begs for a statue

823
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
And Congress blige's really quickly there's no sign the controversial thing but if it's genuinely new thing because For the First Time

824
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
In history of War

825
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
As far as we could tell

826
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
United State

827
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Compensating individual

828
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
Usually the state state hear you have state

829
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Individuals

830
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Inside the US government starts

831
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
Systematically pain money

832
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
For the loss of a non-american life

833
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
In war how much

834
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,016
No actually surprisingly hard to find documentation mentioning

835
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
Pacific mounts

836
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
But whatever

837
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
Teen support Christian biography

838
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
Swift and prompt

839
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Settlement claims

840
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Had a great effect

841
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
On the people

842
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Seem to work very well

843
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Genesis

844
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Semi CID here that like

845
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,544
What we would do with the Drone strike victims we talked about that

846
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Pay the money

847
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
What's actually it's a

848
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
To be trickier than

849
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
Because the thing that person got

850
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
In World War 1

851
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
And that is

852
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
That

853
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
There's a combat exclusion

854
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,928
Kids just walked in that's Gregory Johnson and what he means is that this law

855
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Basically what it said is that will pay your claims

856
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,304
If it didn't happen on the field of battle and it wasn't a combat

857
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Situation

858
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
What's combat

859
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
And it was on the field of battle than

860
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Tough luck

861
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
Just War so if u.s. soldiers were driving to a fight

862
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
And they

863
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
Ran their car into

864
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
To somebody

865
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
And they damage that car killed that person

866
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
Those people would not be able

867
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
How to get compensation whereas if the u.s. soldiers

868
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Driving to a bar

869
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,600
And got in an accident they would be able

870
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
But

871
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Covenants

872
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,744
Once we get into these counterinsurgency wars

873
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Civilians are suddenly

874
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
In the middle of The Fray

875
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Chargers have been made that troops killed as many as 567 South Vietnamese civilians

876
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
This is the story of Modern Warfare

877
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,760
President

878
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:54,368
Mothers and children by the time you get to Afghanistan and Iraq

879
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
So there's no difference really between Battlefield

880
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
My people live

881
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,792
And so the line between what's combat-related what's not combat-related

882
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
It starts to get

883
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Blurry

884
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,496
And so in 2003 and Iraq what happened was there were actually people lining up

885
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
You know there were

886
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,640
Civilian military operation centers people started lining up outside of the saying

887
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
My family has been harmed I want help

888
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
How many people do you remember if I had to guess who is

889
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
Maybe around 80 people are so

890
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
That's a ton of people

891
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Yeah

892
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,696
That's John Tracy he was a military lawyer in Iraq in two

893
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
3

894
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
And for him

895
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,328
Molly Keenan and managing director of Center for civilians in conflict

896
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
So when they came with a complaint with

897
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,520
So what is it like you ran over my chicken or you knocked out my window much more serious

898
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Cluster bomb

899
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,104
During the shock and awe campaign

900
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
One of the

901
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Types of bombs

902
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
That we were using

903
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,504
Are the Air Force was using what would they call cluster munition

904
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,576
HP chances Air Force plane to fly over these targets and drop

905
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
Hundreds and hundreds of these tiny little bombs

906
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,976
Smaller than a Coke can and a lot of them with land in maybe a parking lot

907
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Field and it wouldn't explode so on a number of occasions you'd have mostly was kids right because the kids would

908
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
See it

909
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
And

910
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,984
They didn't know any better it would just run over and kick it

911
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
That's when it would

912
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Explode

913
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Right

914
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
I had a lot of those

915
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
Cost of a dozen and so

916
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
That was a

917
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
That was a difficult one because well

918
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
It's combat

919
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
Because they are forced dropped

920
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Because they were

921
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
Mommy

922
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
The city right

923
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
But at the same time days weeks

924
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
Even months have gone by in this thing is just sitting in the ground

925
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,632
Couldn't we say it's not combat

926
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,472
It was a real question that John had to ask his boss and then his boss

927
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,568
His boss babe I actually sent the question up to the Army claim service

928
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
And they said no it's combat

929
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Meaning they're not going to pay

930
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
Basically like we are in an in an armed conflict

931
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,807
And this was an unfortunate incident but an incident that happened

932
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,879
During a lawful combat operation and therefore

933
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
We're sorry

934
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
And that's basically it so I said no to a lot of pee

935
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,863
Until like in World War 1 with General Pershing Military Officers they started lobbying their bosses

936
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
Expanded system so they can

937
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Start making more payments

938
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Eventually the military.

939
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Bandit

940
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
I talked to one of the military's top lawyers

941
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Brigadier General Richard Cedros

942
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
I go by Rich

943
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,455
I'm the legal counsel to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

944
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
And you told me that around 2006

945
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Peanut

946
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,319
These kind of condolence payments

947
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Actually became sort of a

948
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,439
Key part of military strategy absolutely even had its own acronym

949
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Malls

950
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,511
MAA WS6

951
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
Money as a weapons system which

952
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
You know I

953
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
I'm not sure that

954
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
Title resonates with everybody but in inches

955
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Can be used

956
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
2

957
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,663
To win hearts and Minds that help bring the population over

958
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
And it just got me wondering

959
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
How much money

960
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Makes

961
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
A good weapon

962
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,927
Well I haven't liked the US military hasn't given me access to a database or anything like that but it's through foia is and and and and

963
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Interviews I've seen difference

964
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,303
Numbers Melissa's didn't 2060 ACLU file the foyer

965
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
And eventually got their hands on hundreds of claims files

966
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
In those files what you see are bunch of different numbers

967
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
One that comes up

968
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
Begin Again

969
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
$2,500 2500 bailar

970
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,455
Now it's someone like John could have paid more but that meant they have to run the claim up the chain of command exactly

971
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
It was almost like there were these ceilings

972
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
2500 for a life

973
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,463
1504 property damage and then eventually the property damage amount got raised to 2500

974
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Well

975
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
And

976
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
That didn't make any sense

977
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
But somebody could get so much

978
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
For a Toyota Corolla but

979
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,935
You weren't you were just make it the same amount

980
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
File for a lost life

981
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:59,615
Like I can't get over I mean 2500 seems like just such a nominal amount in the practicality of that money

982
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,431
If like if you were to kill someone who is the

983
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
The Breadwinner of a family

984
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,063
That $2,500 would not be able to support this family in any way

985
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:14,207
Right but we're not actually trying to pay full compensation right like we're not trying to say

986
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
We think if this

987
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
20 year old man had lived

988
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,863
To be the average age in Afghanistan that he knows that it would have been

989
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,935
$60,843

990
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,495
Right like that's not the thing you ever

991
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
You know we had

992
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
People who were killed here

993
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
Federal government is one step closer to cutting it

994
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
First check

995
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
2 families of those

996
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
Killed and injured on September 11

997
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
And those people have been comp

998
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,415
The levels of compensation to the New York victims

999
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Is it is

1000
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Pretty

1001
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
The range of payments for death

1002
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Playing

1003
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Range anywhere from 200

1004
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
$50,000

1005
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
To just under 7 million

1006
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
You noticed that

1007
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Baidu

1008
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Baidu

1009
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,359
But it is to a large degree comparing apples and or

1010
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,175
That's generous again because you're talkin about 8

1011
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Illegal

1012
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
System where country is

1013
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Paying

1014
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Their own victims

1015
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Purses

1016
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,927
Condolences in a in an area where there's no legal obligation to make those

1017
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
What's in the first place

1018
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,255
So that's a very different type of

1019
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
Monetary payments

1020
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
Yes or no essentially it's a

1021
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Person's life

1022
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
And yeah I mean

1023
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,983
I need is an argument to be made that

1024
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,311
Is empathy in the number that you come up with

1025
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Any amount that you

1026
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
Pay for someone's

1027
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
I totally get what you're saying

1028
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
The $2,500

1029
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
I think it's any amount of money if I told you 10 would you feel better about it I mean a little bit better I think so Tim what is it

1030
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Get you though

1031
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,951
Indian $10,000 doesn't buy anything more back than what

1032
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,023
You lie I don't know what time doesn't get you exactly in Afghanistan but my

1033
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,863
Assumption is that it gets you a lot more than 2500

1034
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
But does that really help you

1035
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Is that really what you want

1036
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,983
Where's the money unimportant you really

1037
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
Sounds like the money is really

1038
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,103
I'm not a victim so I don't know that I can answer that to me

1039
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
At this point my oldest story about how before she got in this line of work I had several friends who were

1040
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,879
One of his friends was a man named Chris hondros

1041
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,695
Back in 2011 Christmas on assignment Olivia

1042
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
Movie with the rebel group

1043
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
When they were fired upon

1044
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Chris was killed

1045
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Yeah

1046
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Am I

1047
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
When she found out that happen

1048
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
I wanted someone explain to me why that happened

1049
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
I mean

1050
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
I just want to know

1051
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Lane

1052
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
I didn't even like

1053
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
The newest family was going to get any money I need that

1054
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,063
These guys were shuttle rocket propelled grenade at him working to care

1055
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
No one was going to explain

1056
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
I wanted that

1057
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
And the money then becomes

1058
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
An occasion

1059
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
Please say sike

1060
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
Not just I'm sorry but here's what happened

1061
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Is the Hughes what happened part

1062
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
I think it's the token

1063
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
It's given with the apology and with the exponent

1064
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
But it's the apology and explanation

1065
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
Yeah that's why we call it a mints

1066
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Making amends

1067
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,695
One of the things that is true of money damages

1068
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Generally is there

1069
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
There are desperate effort

1070
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:34,911
To find some common language between the the party paying

1071
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
And the and the victim

1072
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
Some Esperanto for communicating the meaning of what's happened in a language movie

1073
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:49,247
Other side nose matters message on witblits it because we we see it everywhere we look we see

1074
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,647
Apologies apologies at all but we see the the almighty dollar which is both distress

1075
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,975
Sing and also we knew we know it's meaningful

1076
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
But the problem is

1077
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,863
In order for that Esperanza to work it has to stay the same meaning to both sides

1078
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
Which Wich on Tracy

1079
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
What's it really about the money at all

1080
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Not just about the money

1081
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,335
It was as much about the envelope that the money was in

1082
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Or that there was a real person there two handed

1083
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,199
I wasn't the one who raided their house I wasn't

1084
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
The one who

1085
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Killed their daughter

1086
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
But

1087
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
Most of them

1088
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
Babe you know just wanted to look at somebody who's in the universe

1089
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
You really messed with my life

1090
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
That opportunity

1091
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,839
Is exactly what Abdullah LTC

1092
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
Alessia Cara

1093
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
Will never get

1094
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:46,591
His son was killed by a drone he never saw operated by a man who never meet on behalf of a country that still doesn't admit

1095
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
It was a mistake

1096
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
Into the money he got

1097
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,343
Which Indian he says was the equivalent of 30000 US dollars

1098
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,135
Way more than anyone got in Iraq

1099
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Afghanistan

1100
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Still

1101
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
All I can do

1102
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,999
Without anything else to go on

1103
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:08,607
It's just compare amount

1104
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,799
He can accept that only if

1105
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
If

1106
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
He gets to know the

1107
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
Like the payment

1108
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
Equal to CC

1109
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,807
To like in America how long you can persuade someone who

1110
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,927
Who lost his son from the payment was the payment was equal

1111
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Yeah

1112
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Producer Matthew

1113
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Guilty

1114
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,159
Big thanks to Gregory Johnson writer Lodge from BuzzFeed who started us off on this adventure when you brought us

1115
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,559
The initial story also thanks to a buzzfeed editor Steve can tell you about Misawa for helping Matt organize that interview with

1116
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
In Yemen when the country is going through an awful lot of

1117
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Hamilton

1118
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
He was able to

1119
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,191
To get interviews that we didn't think he'd

1120
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,263
Yeah absolutely thank you to him coming up

1121
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:30,271
Hey this is Gregory Johnson

1122
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,087
Jonathan Tracy

40th and park by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation understanding of Science and Technology

1124
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
World more information about

1125
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,815
Www.

1126
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Sloan. Org

1127
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
And this message

1128
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Okay now.

1129
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
And how are you

1130
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Good how you doing

1131
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
Hey I'm Jared I'm right I'm rubber forward to Radiolab and so far we can talk about the value of our lives and then the value of other people

1132
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
Whose lives next up

1133
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,111
Value of

1134
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Everything

1135
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Audit

1136
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Kevlar

1137
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,047
Rethink I buy everything's going swimming this value

1138
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Of nature

1139
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:19,423
That's Carl Zimmer science writer regular blower of Mines soap

1140
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
We

1141
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,751
Think of ecosystems as just kind of

1142
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
Sitting there actually they're doing things

1143
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
They weren't doing them for us we would have to pay

1144
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
To do them artificially

1145
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,271
For example cotton farms in South Texas

1146
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,599
So that you know the farmers are doing their thing like this guy

1147
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,695
James Parker

1148
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:48,095
I don't usually five to six seven hundred acres of cotton Soul say mm Bale

1149
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,143
I spent a lot of time on a tractor in

1150
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
Yes check your water every morning every evening meanwhile

1151
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
They have

1152
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
All this extra help

1153
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
In the air

1154
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
Yes

1155
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,431
How many bats are out there you really don't know

1156
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Flying all around

1157
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
The bats eat

1158
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,831
The equivalent of 2/3 of their own weight

1159
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
In insects

1160
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Every night

1161
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Wow

1162
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,439
They eat all night long

1163
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
All kind of bugs

1164
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
A whole bunch of pets

1165
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
That would otherwise be eating the car

1166
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,959
Now a few years ago guy named John Westfall get a calculation

1167
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:31,359
Came out to my farm and did this study he had some college girls at work for him and those girls were out there all

1168
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,223
All hours of the night listening to what the bats were saying and each year the farmers

1169
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Collectively they make

1170
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
About 45 million dollars off of

1171
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
The farm

1172
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,135
Question was how much of this is because of the bat

1173
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:49,023
You know bats are natural pesticide spray

1174
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Figured out

1175
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,631
Out of 45 million dollars it was around $700,000

1176
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
That

1177
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
You could describe to the bats

1178
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
It's just beautiful

1179
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,775
I mean it does make me sick

1180
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
If you're those farmers

1181
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
You should be compensating the bats

1182
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
Yeah well yeah

1183
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
It does give you a glimpse

1184
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,135
The kind of scale of value economic value

1185
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,719
That nature has that we generally just totally ignore but

1186
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,023
We talked to a guy who didn't ignore

1187
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,375
My name is Robert costanzo in fact he took this way of thinking to the app

1188
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
Absolute limit

1189
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
So the question was

1190
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
What's the value of all of these ecosystem Services globally

1191
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
All the services on Earth has bugs eating leaves worms turning the soil is chewing tree stump

1192
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
Taking cities during storms everything

1193
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:45,087
We tried to synthesize all of the studies that had been done around the country in the world

1194
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Like that bad study

1195
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Except I didn't just look at it

1196
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Cotton Farms they looked at tropical forest

1197
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Rivers and lakes

1198
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Corriere

1199
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:56,351
Coastal Wetland Inland Wetland the ocean Woodlands temperate forest you know it goes on and on

1200
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,143
Excel spreadsheet

1201
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
It's it's kind of a Excel spreadsheet

1202
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,799
From hell can get tricky so Costanza and his colleagues took all these different

1203
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,639
Some of them together did a whole bunch of math and

1204
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
Came up with a number

1205
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,223
Which in today's dollars

1206
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527
Is 142.7

1207
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
A trillion dollars

1208
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Pergear

1209
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
Car services

1210
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
That's more than

1211
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
All of the

1212
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
Gross national product

1213
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Of the world

1214
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
That's how viable

1215
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
The services of nature are

1216
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,703
Masc guy get the I get the way this will work with a bat

1217
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,263
Play bats eating the box but like how do you do it

1218
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
With like

1219
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Would like a like a

1220
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,919
Field or something like you just walk through and I guess that's

1221
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
20 bucks

1222
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
How do you figure out what the services are

1223
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
Well are they they came up with a list

1224
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
So

1225
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,903
The list kind of depends

1226
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
On the ecosystem you're talkin about

1227
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,023
Does different ecosystems provide different services

1228
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
For example

1229
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
A

1230
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
A salt marsh

1231
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
And we are in the Waterfront

1232
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
You're in the water

1233
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,287
What is it with Sweets Salt marshes it like a Florida wetlands

1234
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,847
I don't know what a salt marsh

1235
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
Salt marshes are wetlands that are on the

1236
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,015
Coast Guard water here we're quickly approaching high tide

1237
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,343
We sent one of our producers simonelli to a nearby salt marsh

1238
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,951
Parsley to Hazen your boots are much more water

1239
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
Talk to this guy

1240
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,047
My name is Adam Whelchel and I'm the director science

1241
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
For The Nature Conservancy here in Connecticut and Adam gave Simon Atlantic inventory

1242
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
/

1243
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
Coastal salt marshes

1244
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
The stream of goods and services

1245
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Invited over time

1246
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
One of the things that does is

1247
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,431
It takes water that's coming in

1248
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,759
From Inland and it's Laden with all sorts of pollutant salsa

1249
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,575
Start the bad stuff the salt marsh was trapped at water so the

1250
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,647
Settle in and very often the Marsh Grass

1251
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,695
Will suck up that water

1252
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Do the roots and

1253
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
Clean it up

1254
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
So you could ask Gary

1255
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
How much would you have to

1256
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Suspend

1257
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
To keep your water

1258
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
That clean

1259
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
There is one other study guide

1260
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
Adam Whelchel said that scientists New England already figured that out

1261
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:18,687
For flood control water supply protection pollution controls roughly about $31

1262
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
Cars in $0.22

1263
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:26,623
Per hectare per year then you got to add the value of all the plants that feed the fish that end up on our dinner play 338.

1264
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:31,743
Been there the birdwatchers that by latte support the local economy

1265
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:37,375
$90 per hectare and then there's habitat provisioning the list goes on and on and on

1266
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,935
You get kind of obsessed with that you start like

1267
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,007
You start becoming an accountant and writing down numbers

1268
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Seriously

1269
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,847
And it gets you too

1270
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,895
Think about nature

1271
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
In a different way

1272
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Then you had before

1273
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,735
Galling

1274
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,807
Element over this aspect like when I first came across

1275
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,879
This pointer producer Tim Howard jump into the interview in

1276
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
You'll also hear Opera

1277
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Pretty sister on wheeler in

1278
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,999
I do feel like in an example like the Salt March

1279
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,815
Which cleans water that's all reliant on

1280
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,143
People being there that need water so if you didn't have people there

1281
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:16,543
Does that saltmarsh cica have any value but Tim haven't you ever had a conversation with somebody who just doesn't get

1282
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
Like if you make the aesthetic art

1283
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
Which is that nature

1284
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,199
Should be should be preserved for its own sake

1285
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,039
There's a whole category of humanity just doesn't respond to that argument

1286
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,831
Is this becomes a way to

1287
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,975
Talk across the aisle but it does still feel like Adam Oates something of infinite value

1288
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
2 something of

1289
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,911
Appeal evaluation really beat infinite value I mean would like a mother's love you don't take your mother's love is priceless I mean you know

1290
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
Okay

1291
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
II

1292
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,007
Totally accept that there is

1293
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,335
The Serta Priceless aspect of nature

1294
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
But if you are

1295
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,943
In the government in a very poor country

1296
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
You have some tough choices to make

1297
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,831
If somebody comes to you and says okay you got these lovely mangrove

1298
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
How it turns out that

1299
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
That the desert of

1300
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,207
Setting with mangoes are is the perfect place

1301
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
For shrimp aquaculture

1302
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,327
Biggest shrimp Farms need lots of seawater so it makes sense to

1303
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,143
But then we're going to put in these Farms are going to go shrimp

1304
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,727
You are going to get millions and millions of dollars in tax revenue

1305
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,079
If you're thinking about the welfare of all the people in your country

1306
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
Many of them are starving

1307
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
That might be a really powerful argument

1308
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
Not into that kind of a discussion

1309
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,295
You can bring in

1310
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,599
The fact that these men grows

1311
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
Are sitting there

1312
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:38,463
Very quietly doing all sorts of incredibly valuable thing

1313
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,023
In fact they've done these kind of calculation

1314
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
And in some cases

1315
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
The services that mangroves provide

1316
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
AR

1317
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
4 *

1318
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
More valuable than what you could get out

1319
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
With shrimp so it's stupid

1320
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
It's just stupid

1321
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,823
In a bit very basic sense

1322
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
To wantonly replace lots of mangroves

1323
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
With shrimp aquaculture

1324
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,295
Is that a hypothetical situation know that's your ass

1325
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:08,671
This is Glenn Marie Lang she's an environmental economist for the World Bank and she says very often

1326
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,327
She finds herself in exactly this kind of conversation. You know I work for the world bank's or prime

1327
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
Primary clients are our governments

1328
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,471
Philippines Vietnam when you're talkin to a minister of finance and saying

1329
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,567
You know what I know jobs are jobs but you need those Marsha

1330
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,431
They have value don't say well yeah that's true but that means I'm going to have to reduce

1331
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,247
The money that I put into the education budget

1332
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,831
So you got to really make a strong argument about the benefits

1333
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,903
That's really where the rubber hits the road

1334
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Well

1335
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,999
I mean that's here's the counter-argument it comes from Doug McCauley and

1336
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
The college's at Universal

1337
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
City California

1338
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
Santa Barbara the real danger is that we actually succeed that we

1339
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,215
We convince people that nature is Viola cuz it makes money and then where

1340
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,287
We're really in trouble in the minions is for a doesn't make us money

1341
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,335
What do you do in a situation he says we're

1342
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,383
Say a bunch of rivers are running dry

1343
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
I am there

1344
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,991
Quote depreciating in value you know by the same logic that you trained to think with

1345
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:11,391
We should go out and liquidate these natural assets that makes me feel really uncomfortable he says it's just kind of a weird way to think

1346
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,695
Nature proposal hearing

1347
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
City California to make

1348
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Gay marriage law

1349
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
And

1350
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,839
Economist how to look at this legislation and said

1351
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
This is

1352
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
Expected to generate

1353
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,703
163 million dollars annually

1354
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
State of California

1355
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Well

1356
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
It's good to know that

1357
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,895
I appreciate having that information in front of me however when I'm making a

1358
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,455
A decision on this legislation and I would say

1359
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
It wouldn't many legislators

1360
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,319
Voters average citizens are considering issues at hand

1361
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,391
They're not thinking about whether they're going to make hundreds

1362
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
60 million dollars

1363
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
The state that thinking about a different set of values

1364
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,047
On the other hand I want to say and this is based on my

1365
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,351
Experience working in developing country

1366
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,143
When you don't

1367
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,703
Put a value on these services

1368
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
Basically they don't get counted

1369
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,823
They get implicitly assigned a value of 0

1370
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Queenie Glenn Murray

1371
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,919
And as we were debating this going back and forth and back

1372
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,479
We bumped into a story

1373
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,319
About what happens when all of these value of nature ideas are

1374
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,111
Are let loose into a world

1375
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Fruits

1376
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
And trees

1377
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Human uncertainty

1378
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
The parable of the bees

1379
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,351
We heard this first from writer JB MacKinnon who says the Story begins

1380
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,911
And now County in central China

1381
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,959
Rural area fairly remote

1382
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,519
Lush Green Mountains filled with apple orchards

1383
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,079
And apple orchard in was

1384
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
What is the main business

1385
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,407
I'm going to JB in in the 1990s

1386
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,735
The wild bees male County slowly started to

1387
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
To disappear

1388
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
There's a few different

1389
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,855
Reasons given for that

1390
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,415
It could have been the destruction of the habitat

1391
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
The bees nest in

1392
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,791
The heavy honey harvesting that wasn't leaving enough food for the bees but the

1393
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
The prevailing Theory

1394
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,095
He's actually a nikkah nama

1395
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,679
Because Emma 1990s of China was shifting to a market-based

1396
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
Apple producers are under pressure to produce

1397
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
More apples

1398
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
So they started spraying pesticide

1399
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,383
Probably it was a constellation of

1400
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,175
All of those things in a few others

1401
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,711
End result is

1402
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,503
Baby stopped buzzing in mouth County

1403
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
Which if you are

1404
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
Apple farmer

1405
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
That's a disaster

1406
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,903
Bees travel from flower to flower

1407
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
Search of nectar they are over there

1408
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Dusted with

1409
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
Pollen which is

1410
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
The means by which flowers

1411
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,583
Engage in sexual intercourse

1412
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,655
So if you don't have the bees making the birds and the bees

1413
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
On the blossoms

1414
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Then

1415
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,007
Then you don't get fertile flowers

1416
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,663
To turn into turn into fruit and obviously if you're a fruit farmer and you have no fruit to sell you have no income

1417
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:50,111
So what are you do you're not performing you don't have these then you need to find some other way to pollinate the flowers

1418
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,415
And I guess they concluded

1419
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
What will have to add ourselves

1420
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,071
Bai hat in Mandarin Chinese with Asian Gong Show

1421
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,655
And so would be that means Emmanuel coronation

1422
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,823
This is Harold Tebow in China for the French newspaper Le Monde a couple years ago

1423
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
The Apple farmers in mouth

1424
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
Lcounty so he flies to Chengdu and he in a friend Hopper

1425
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:20,063
In the car and we drive for like five or six hours until we reach a disability International

1426
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
Tiny little village

1427
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,879
Few houses

1428
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,927
And then we took your smaller

1429
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,463
Rodenbach

1430
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
The field

1431
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,047
And we have to be so old that they wear

1432
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
Lots of farmers

1433
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,143
In the trees like on the apple trees

1434
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,191
Rattling up and down these muffins

1435
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Thin and spindly branches

1436
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
Men and women that have seen in in

1437
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Photos

1438
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:46,687
Harold and his friend took pictures and if you look at those pictures you'll see the farmers holding little brats

1439
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:53,087
Little pollen brush that they constructed using things like Chopsticks and chicken feathers and cigarette filter

1440
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,671
I made have a little bottle filled with pollen and then what they do

1441
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,743
They dip the brush into the Ballon a paint

1442
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
Poem

1443
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Makeup airbrush Mac

1444
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
Into the pollen

1445
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Make me the next flower

1446
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
Canada

1447
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
Begin again and I paint again

1448
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,983
To make sure that that

1449
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,799
All of the blossoms that they could possibly fertilized

1450
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:17,407
Would be fertilized so that they would go on to produce fruit we're talking hundreds and hundreds

1451
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
The flowers for

1452
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
Missouri

1453
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,735
Strange to see you

1454
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Are you human

1455
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
The job of the bees

1456
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,599
How would a pain in the ass

1457
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
The image of this of these

1458
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,767
Chinese orchardist standing up in these spindly trees

1459
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,351
Traveled around the world through environmental circles

1460
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
And it

1461
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,423
The message that it seemed to send was that

1462
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:45,311
This is what happens if you if you lose biodiversity you end up standing in the trees

1463
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,127
Doing the job that the bees used to do on the win

1464
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
For free

1465
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
For free

1466
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
Those people are just like

1467
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,783
Human beast in this guy

1468
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
Yeah

1469
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,183
Human Beast four years ago he travel to mail County to do

1470
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
Economic analysis of just how much the loss of the bees

1471
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
Is hurting the farmers amount County

1472
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,119
But what he discovered weird

1473
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,471
Was it the trees were producing more apples than ever

1474
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
What production

1475
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
This can be confirmed

1476
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
Zelmore production

1477
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,455
For hand pollination apple tree bee pollination for tree

1478
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,991
Humans are more efficient

1479
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,343
Really people were doing it better than the beasts I've been doing it

1480
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,647
A lot better reproduction went up

1481
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:38,303
30% that's what the farmers told you disenchant just kind of amazing

1482
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
Amber amazing

1483
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,399
Because I think hand pollination can pollinate

1484
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,727
Maserati every flower

1485
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
And bees don't pollinate a flower

1486
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,311
These are a little bit

1487
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
Yeah they're a little bit uneven when it comes to

1488
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,247
I don't like it if it's damp

1489
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:02,111
They don't like it if it's windy in all those cases bees often decide to stay indoors and just take

1490
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:07,231
You send people out there and tell him to pollinate every damn block

1491
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,327
And they're going to do it and there is the additional benefit of

1492
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
The people that you paid

1493
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,655
They go to the bar they buy groceries babe

1494
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,679
Spend those earnings

1495
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
In their local communities in a way that

1496
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Obviously

1497
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Bees never did

1498
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,591
To hear you had this whole story that was supposed to be about

1499
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,967
How important the bees are in the parable of biodiversity through that may be the lessons just the opposite

1500
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
They're actually

1501
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
We don't need bees

1502
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
And maybe we never did

1503
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,135
If we only measure things economically then we might conclude that

1504
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:40,767
That some species are some ecological processes just aren't necessary in certain places

1505
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
I or that we might

1506
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Even do better

1507
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,399
To to take care of those

1508
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,447
Processes ourselves right

1509
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
So

1510
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,775
Let me find My Notes app

1511
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,079
Which is exactly but there's one more chapter

1512
01:06:54,335 --> 01:07:00,479
The story Harold the boat told us when he visited then Chen

1513
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Is there a 68

1514
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,831
And he said in his opinion

1515
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Henry Nation

1516
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,231
Night disappear in a few years

1517
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:16,095
Apparently as China's economy has continued to grow workers have started demanding better pay

1518
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,399
New wages are getting so high

1519
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,519
Father welcomes that the farmers have to employ to help them basically it's not efficient

1520
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
Economically

1521
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,871
To do the information anymore

1522
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Now they're like

1523
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
They thinking

1524
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,711
Need a piece back right yeah

1525
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:38,111
Problem is there are no Bees in those Villages anymore beekeepers in other parts of China

1526
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
Not going to bring their bees

1527
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
This area cuz they worry about the pesticide

1528
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
At the pharmacy

1529
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,023
That's what when wild bees might come back

1530
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,839
Weather for this week

1531
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,375
It's very hard to make a prediction

1532
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
If you have the Farmer they like

1533
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
What would you do I don't know

1534
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
History of that

1535
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
Story thieves me

1536
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,687
It leaves me thinking that you can Amish is just not a good way

1537
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,479
Putting an r value

1538
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Even though

1539
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Even up

1540
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Syson

1541
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,831
Thoughtful value on a b

1542
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,855
On the pound

1543
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,927
It you do it and you think you're smart

1544
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,255
But then the value changes the bees go from being worth a lot

1545
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,559
To being worth nothing to be worth everything

1546
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,423
What was in a few years this this is what markets do they swing back forth

1547
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,959
And we pretend that we can play

1548
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
But we never can

1549
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
So you can't put the volume cuz you can always going to be wrong or right

1550
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Weather Cypress

1551
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,247
Nowhere in the story did someone walk into the middle of

1552
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
The proceedings

1553
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,087
You know what these do have value here's the number

1554
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:47,487
Text Carl we were talking to him told us you know they've been estimates that the value of pollination

1555
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
When it comes from wild bees

1556
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
Is 190 billion dollars

1557
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,399
So that's globally right but still there was nobody in the room

1558
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,727
Giving that kind of number to the bees were inherently valued at

1559
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:04,127
Zero remember Beazer value to 0 only until humans get valued more than bees go down if he's going to have a lot of

1560
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
Numbers in your head what I like about this idea is it

1561
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,247
When you put a number on a bee or a bat

1562
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Are Marsh

1563
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
It's like an attempt

1564
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
2force

1565
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
What kind of long-term thinking

1566
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,183
You can just say don't do that mean something that like a conservation to say don't

1567
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
But if you say don't do that

1568
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
Here's the Valium so lost

1569
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351
Yeah here's the lost one that actually gives the whole

1570
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,399
Precautionary don't sing some teeth

1571
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Except for this

1572
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
That if you go

1573
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Businesses

1574
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
And you're wrong

1575
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,919
There are irreversibilities that's how environmental economist Glenn Marie Lange

1576
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:43,551
This is one of the differences between natural ecosystems and what we produce

1577
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:48,159
You smash your car hey someone can build a new one if you lose the bees

1578
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
Many instances

1579
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,487
You cannot bring them back

1580
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,791
So the question we got to is

1581
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
Is there another way to think about the value of nature

1582
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,655
Show me the way that's not economic

1583
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,727
And therefore short-sighted know about us but also

1584
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,263
Not simply about

1585
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,567
The Aesthetics in the beauty cuz I can be sore

1586
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
Is there another way

1587
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,407
The best I was able to do

1588
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,431
Thinking about that

1589
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
Writer JB MacKinnon

1590
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Was

1591
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,271
When it struck me that

1592
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
That in a way

1593
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
All of this

1594
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,415
Diversity that's out there all this biological diversity all these

1595
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
Wonderful and amazing

1596
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,535
And alien things that other species can do

1597
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,607
Is like an extension of our own brains

1598
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
There's so much imagination out there that we simply

1599
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Could not come up with

1600
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
On our own

1601
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,543
That

1602
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,079
We can think of it as

1603
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
As a pool

1604
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Of imagination

1605
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,199
And creativity from which we

1606
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,247
As humans are able to draw

1607
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
And that when we draw down on that

1608
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
On that pool of

1609
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,647
Creativity and Imagination

1610
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
We

1611
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
We deeply impoverished ourselves

1612
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,999
New innocence we are

1613
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
We are doing harm

1614
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,095
To our own ability to think

1615
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,399
I didn't do and dream

1616
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:24,415
JB MacKinnon book is called The Once and Future World he's written many but this one is my favorite thanks to Carl Zimmer

1617
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,463
Reporting in the New York Times

1618
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,255
On this topic is really what got us

1619
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
Launch today

1620
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:34,655
And what got us through this whole thing is Simon Adler whose production assistance was invaluable that was him

1621
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:41,055
Freezing his ass off in the marsh I talked so long

1622
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,103
How to spell awfully

1623
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,015
Thank you and thank you guys for listening on Jedi

1624
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
We'll see you next time

1625
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,463
Hi Robert costanzo

1626
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:02,047
Glenn Marie Lange

1627
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:07,167
Adam Whelchel I'm calling in to read some credit show here we go

1628
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
