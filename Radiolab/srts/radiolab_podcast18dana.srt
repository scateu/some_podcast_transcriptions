1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:06,144
Before we get started this episode has a lot of strong language including

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,936
Repetitive f-bombs

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,240
Strung together to a beach

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,456
Start listening to Radiolab

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,576

Second one in the pear

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,912
They grew out of our reporting on

9
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:43,776
X's and y's and all the different biological realities that live inside of us

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
In this episode

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408

I can hear you buy this is Molly Webster I can hear you or one of your working the other ones Purdue

13
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,832
Why would you want to just

14
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
Turn the headphones around

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
Lena is doing something

16
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
China historic

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
I guess you could say and just to start us off Dana uses the pronoun they

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Not him or her but they

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,032
And a few years ago cuz I was 15 or 14 I can't remember which

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
I have memory issues

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
It's around 2014

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,968
Dana is filling out passport application and there are two boxes

23
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Male or female

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
And Dana's like well I'm not either one of those

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,392
And so they wrote in a third option

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Intersex

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Bye-bye basically apply for my passport

28
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
Got talked to by the manager of the office

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
You should be no side inside you. You cannot get this password

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
And they turn me down and I

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Appealing you can appeal a passport app

32
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Yeah

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
To who

34
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Do you go back to the passport office

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Yeah but I feel

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
The passport office rejected the appeal basically saying male or female

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
That's all we got from there I found legal counsel

38
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
So

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Dana and

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:19,008
Suing the state department for a third non female non male option

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,360
Seabright Dana into the studio to talk about the State Department case

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
And

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,528
While we were having our conversation what began to unfold like in their personal life story

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Was it tale of words

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
How words have the power to shape the world

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
I was an Air Force brat

47
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
So we moved all over the

48
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Replace

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
I was born in 1958

50
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,384
Michigan was in the military your dad or your mom

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
It was a clear Air Force pilot

52
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,088
So is in Alabama for awhile Texas for a while Mark Montana for a while

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
England for a while as a kid

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
Grew up with a bunch of Brothers who older brothers and one younger like a whole pack of boys

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
Only 18 months apart

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
But they never really felt like one of them

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Yeah I got Tuesday

58
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
When I start showering with

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Other boys in probably like the 5th grade

60
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Sorry

61
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,224
Cheese about

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Life-size

63
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
And looking physically different down there

64
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
My testicles didn't

65
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Book like the other boys would it look like a stuffed sausage it was little

66
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Didn't look right never felt right either

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
From when you were little

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
Smaller ball like a girl

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
The brothers tried to help or

70
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Trying to teach me how to do things better to use my hero 4 try to stick up for me but we will

71
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
The world was a scary place

72
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
My dad was always gone flying and he was kind of a scary figure

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Mother she had

74
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
A backhand that wouldn't quit and she never play tennis

75
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
And Dana says for some reason

76
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Their parents always kept a close watch on them

77
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
Remember once in childhood

78
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
We are living on Arkansas the girl.

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Store had

80
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,911
Lowe's cut out Barbie Walt doll clothes and when you know where is cardboard

81
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Barbies

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
She has those and we're playing with those

83
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
She and I

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Yeah

85
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
My dad caught

86
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
I got my my butt

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Sprite and boys don't play with dolls

88
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
My brothers were able to do

89
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Somewhere that but I was allowed to

90
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
I'll see you think like if your brother was playing the paper dolls with the neighbor it would have been a different response

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Did you have any idea like why

92
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Nope

93
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
I knew something was different I just

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
I have no words

95
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
My world

96
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Was very small

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
I think you could say was partially because of that smallness

98
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
An effort to make the world

99
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Like a little bit bigger

100
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
In 1978 at 20

101
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,415
You did

102
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
That's so interesting because I would think that you would run away from the military after your dad

103
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Frozen air force of one of the stations

104
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
What 260 Americans

105
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
And I'll be getting there

106
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Day of captivity

107
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
The Persian Gulf

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Android

109
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,463
Praetorian

110
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Beirut

111
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,607
How did it feel to be to be part of the military or at least away from home

112
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
And away from your siblings in your parents

113
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
It felt really good I felt a little free

114
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
Free free of the confines

115
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
But

116
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Couple things happened when I was in the Navy

117
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
About 5 years ago

118
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
People started thinking I was

119
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
I thought I did anyting

120
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,719
To encourage that I didn't date anybody to do anything

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
Or do you remember how that started or why I was so

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
Small I didn't go out

123
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
Drinking and trying to pick up women with a guy

124
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Yeah

125
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
There was somebody on board my first job

126
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Who I guess it was

127
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Putting books and magazines

128
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Are my rock

129
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Greg a contact

130
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
Gay-p*** or something horn

131
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Are some books

132
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
You could think that leaving gay p***

133
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
On someone's bed or bookshelf

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
It's not that big of a deal or something

135
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Initiation thing or something

136
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,399
But this was at a time before don't ask don't tell where if you are gay

137
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
You were kicked out so

138
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
I got caught up in

139
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Witch Hunt

140
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
You're a one-point

141
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
Which is a precursor to the NCIS

142
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,991
The National Institute of security

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
Navy intelligence service okay

144
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,671
Give me another acronym on May 11th

145
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
Anyway so they interrogated me about

146
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,351
Yeah I know who I was dating who I have sex with friends

147
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Yeah you know those kind of things

148
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,775
And then while all that was happening on my second tour late

149
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
All

150
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
1982 was working below deck is doing some paperwork in a noisy fan room and

151
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
An announcement went out on the ship that said that they're going to do a test launch of one of the gigantic missiles on board

152
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
But Dana didn't hear the announcement because they were in the super loud room

153
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Anna

154
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
I get done with paperwork

155
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
I opened

156
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
Hatch to go back into the ship

157
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
I step out

158
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
The gun goes off

159
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,775
Firing a 70lb projectile

160
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
20-30 feet away from my head

161
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Holy crap

162
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
Now on the Carmen basically white blood out of my ears get me some aspirin and said get your balance back

163
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
I can go back to work

164
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,231
Raceway back in those days I didn't know about where you weren't too concerned about

165
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
Brain injuries are there that didn't say just go back where you find you know they didn't really realize how much

166
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Screwed up you can be from

167
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
Dana said that ever since that time so I can't I have a hard time

168
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Looking backwards

169
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
Telling time

170
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Needless to say

171
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
After the Witch Hunt

172
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
And brain injury

173
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
But I'm like

174
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
When I got out you know for years after I got out I think it was or a little bit longer I

175
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
Started going to Colorado State University

176
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
I was about

177
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
30 years old

178
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,447
During their first semester Dana was in

179
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
A poetry class

180
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
And Dana says something in the words of those

181
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Poets and in the class discussion

182
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
Christian to go see the college therapy

183
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
I walked in and someone you know

184
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
I think I'm depressed and I'm think I'm gay

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Tell me more about the why you thought you were gay

186
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
Two things

187
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
All that confusion going on in my mind

188
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,615
Am I a boy or girl kind of thing is I don't really know what the hell is going on with me anyway

189
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
Dennis's didn't really feel like a boy like the way other boys do

190
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
It kind of felt like an off-kilter kind of boy

191
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
What do you call that

192
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
And then

193
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
All these

194
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Which France

195
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,023
In the Navy got me really excited thinking about

196
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Whether I was or not

197
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Like maybe those guys were seeing

198
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
Something The Dana couldn't see it that that was true

199
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
I thought well I must be a gay man

200
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Cuz I didn't know anything else

201
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
I didn't know how any other term

202
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,455
We had gay lesbian bisexual and we had crossdressers

203
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
Oh yeah sorry that you're like okay out of those options which one feels the most like me

204
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,207
What I thought was

205
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
So

206
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
I want the game a land

207
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
You know I didn't date anybody but the therapist that Dana saw ended up recommending that they go join

208
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
This group on campus

209
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
It was the gay and lesbian Alliance

210
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
Which later became the gay lesbian bisexual Alliance

211
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
That's how long ago was

212
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
This would have been 1989 ish

213
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
Yeah like walking into that

214
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
Group what is that here I am

215
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,207
What does it feel like to hear you are

216
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
You know I don't know what to wake

217
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
And they just said I'm welcome have a seat

218
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Are you dating her your father anything like that doesn't me some hard first questions I think I drive

219
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
If someone started the conversation went bad

220
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
Sign off on certain things

221
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,599
Yeah but they were very welcoming and I thought well at least there is a

222
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
Place that I can hang out with people

223
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Accept me for being different

224
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Within a short while

225
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
Dana is not just going to meetings but is protesting at the group because

226
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Cuz around that time something called amendment 2 was proposed in Colorado

227
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
Local law that protect homosexuals from discrimination

228
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
Amendment to close up in Colorado

229
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
So

230
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
We got ourselves pretty organized

231
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
I want to learn Moore County

232
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Republican convention thing oh my god really so you became something of an active

233
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
A spokesman for the

234
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
TriStar waking up or being woke

235
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
What are the term is is

236
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
I'm a lot more woke now than I was then

237
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:15,903
I was like I got my first sip of coffee and the caffeine started okay start to work on your brain

238
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,255
Different colors

239
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
There was one problem though

240
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Living as a

241
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Gay man as I was at that time

242
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Dana was not gay

243
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,311
They filled it home as a gay man but they were mostly attracted to women

244
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,663
And towards end of college in their late 30s

245
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,271
Working in the fibers Department doing my studio class

246
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
This woman

247
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
When he kept coming in and watching me work

248
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
She got the wrong me I got to know her

249
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
We started dating

250
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
We got married

251
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Really

252
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
Wow you went all the way to marriage

253
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
And this isn't this is

254
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,079
Early aughts or like late night okay

255
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
2007 we got divorced

256
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
5 years

257
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,527
Yeah didn't work out we both had issues we weren't dealing with

258
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,927
Dana says this. Of their life up through the marriage through the end of it it was very confusing

259
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
They're just trying to figure out where they

260
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
Stood and they were trying out of these terms like

261
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Bisexual

262
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Also Prince

263
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,727
Transformer into the room

264
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Because I mean I was hearing more more about

265
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Trans

266
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
People in Lawton okay

267
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
Starting to read a little bit about a so

268
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,831
White well maybe maybe and why did that feel more true than gay male

269
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
Or straight male

270
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,511
Where are you because I knew this there was a feminine qualities about myself. I had to record

271
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Okay so

272
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
I thought well

273
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
Another man I must be a woman in the only kind of woman like I thought I could be was going to be a Transformer

274
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,103
Meaning to Dana a person who was born male but identified as a woman

275
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
So you're like

276
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Holy crap so you were like

277
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,271
That's so interesting that like

278
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,391
Well that's where I went to I can't halfway house

279
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
HSN it's it's like in

280
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
In a world where there's limited words

281
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,423
You're just you're just trying to figure out the word that fits you

282
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
Right what's it's like a small steps towards

283
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
The truth

284
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
So yeah

285
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
After the divorce I'm I'm looking at

286
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Myself

287
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Insane okay

288
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
What's going on here with me

289
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
This isn't working

290
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
What Dana discovers

291
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
After the break

292
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,375
So cool

293
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959

300
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,399
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

Basically I want to hear about this

304
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
I kid you know did something

305
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
It just means you lean back and say

306
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Well

307
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

308
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Back to you

309
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

310
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Or maybe the kids in math

311
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Music in the margin of their geometry

312
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
We're interested in the

313
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Specific moments where

314
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Kid does something super smart

315
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

316
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639

Episode 5

325
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
The story of Dana's in

326
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,895
At this point Dana is divorced and feeling really unsure about who they are

327
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
They tried girl trans

328
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Bye

329
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
None of it seemed right

330
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
I was really just shoveled I was really

331
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
I was praying I was like

332
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
I wasn't taking care of myself

333
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
Dana says at this point

334
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,335
I started to really wonder where is all this confusion

335
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Coming from

336
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
So I started digging deeper

337
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Okay

338
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
A lot of stuff is going on what happened to me

339
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
As a child

340
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,671
I had always have these like Memories

341
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
Some of them

342
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,839
Of having surgery as a kid being like 3 4 5 6 Indian Hospital

343
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,935
So I was pretty much there alone most of the time

344
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
My grandparents visited me once my dad was her once

345
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
How many surgeries do you think there were

346
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
I don't know

347
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
I'm more than one definitely more than one

348
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Between 3 and 6 years old I have multiple

349
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
I just don't know how many

350
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Only had like

351
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Tiny fragments of these memories

352
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,255
It's hard to remember anything when you're 3 anyways

353
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
But now in their 50s

354
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Dana started to look back in wonder

355
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
What were those surgeries

356
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
Also does that explain why I feel so different down there and like why I'm in pain I was in such a

357
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Pain that I was walking bow-legged

358
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Try to keep anything from touching it

359
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
If I started working out

360
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Penis surgeries

361
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Trying to figure out what happened there

362
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,231
Okay I don't know what happened to me as a kid but I know I had this pain and I know I had the surgery so maybe they're connect

363
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,119
Right so I started looking up that look a lot of different diagrams of penis surgeries

364
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,727
All these different types of thousands of different penis surgeries in mi

365
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
Should I didn't know there was that many

366
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
Erectile dysfunction surgeries

367
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Penis pumps

368
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Looking and then I'm like

369
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
I was trying to match up scar tissue

370
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
02 that was your approach

371
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,391
Am I approached you must have seen some gnarly photos

372
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,999
While searching all these photos on the internet Dana did start to see

373
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
Images where the scar tissue like the patterns of the scars

374
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Looked familiar

375
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
That's when I found this term

376
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Better sex in the Maya just popped up

377
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
On the screen that pops up on

378
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
You want to do surgery things

379
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Intersex

380
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
What the hell is that

381
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
So I typed in Anderson

382
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,391
The internet was full of information

383
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
Bills are really starting to go off

384
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Rain in my head drawing

385
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Baby

386
00:20:54,655 --> 00:21:00,799
And I was just starting therapy at the VA Hospital up in Cheyenne Wyoming

387
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Wyoming

388
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,407
She convinced me to go see a urologist at the VA

389
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
And he confirmed yesterday that I was intersex

390
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,512
What what does intersex actually even mean in your case cuz it can mean a lot of things like what

391
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,656
Did one of the doctors say she was born with ambiguous genitalia and they constructed

392
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
Basic Ray my genitalia look male

393
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,872
Other words like Dana wasn't born with what the doctors would consider male or female genitalia it was like they

394
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,248
Add something that seemed to be there in a large clitoris or maybe a small penis it was unclear

395
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
And maybe there's a little bit of a vaginal opening

396
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
And Dana's case and as is often the case

397
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
Babies that are born this way

398
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,560
Parents don't really know what to do in the doctor will basically say well you got to pick one

399
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
And they picked mail

400
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't know exactly who made that decision I think it was my father

401
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Shut that off looks like a penis to me

402
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
That sounds like my father

403
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
But anyway

404
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
The doctors

405
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
They constructed

406
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Apenas

407
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Should have been

408
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
Large clitoris probably

409
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
How old are you at this point

410
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
When you figured all this out

411
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
50

412
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
You are 50

413
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I'm 60 now 10 years ago

414
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
Wow

415
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,008
You are 5-0 when you finally found out that you were interested

416
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Next Step

417
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
Dana says

418
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
When they figured all this out they had

419
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Two simultaneous

420
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,016
Feelings one I was living

421
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Why didn't my parents tell

422
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
I

423
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
Basically lion true my whole life

424
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Did you call them

425
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Yes

426
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
What did your mom say

427
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Not much

428
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
She basically was angry back at

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
She said your boy

430
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
You're always be a boy

431
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,336
Would your father still alive when you found out about the inter

432
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh yeah I called him to and what did he say

433
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,808
Feeling hot a lot and kind of said he was sorry

434
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Which is where we start reconciling

435
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Did he

436
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Blaine

437
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,536
Where he was coming from it all when you were alone you're a little

438
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
No not really but you know

439
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,448
How to learn how to forgive myself for all my anger with my parents

440
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
And forgive them as well

441
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,896
Medina says that like a mitts processing that rage

442
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,016
For almost a year

443
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,088
Tell me about the Euphoria why

444
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,232
Because I finally had an answer I mean it was a question I had asked and wondered about my entire life

445
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Open at Point

446
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
The question being

447
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Am I a boy or a girl

448
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
The answer is yes

449
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Both

450
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Yeah

451
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
That was you fart

452
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,384
What does Euphoria feel like to you walking on air

453
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
I know what I am and what I had to break the binary

454
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
That was

455
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
Break the binary

456
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Yeah

457
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,792
Are you okay if I'm not a man I'm not a woman I must be

458
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120
Intersex or hermaphrodite

459
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
That works

460
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,664
But it's not the question I should have been asking it was like who am I and those kind of things but

461
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
You're saying the question you should have been asking is who am I not am I a boy or a girl

462
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Be kind of questions most people ask

463
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,792
What Dana means is that those are the kind of questions most people get to ask

464
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
But they were so forced

465
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Inter

466
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,472
Like wondering if they were a boy or a girl that they never got

467
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,824
To get to like the big existential life questions that most of us

468
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
You know wrestle with they were just

469
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,176
Way back at Ground Zero

470
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
But I got unstuck

471
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,832
What is it like me until I find a word that explains you

472
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
It was so cool

473
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Ja

474
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,608
I think it was probably the happiest times in my life

475
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888

Queer

479
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
Is there anything in

480
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360

481
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Free end

Start of euphoric and you now or is there anything that

484
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Still feels confining

485
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Yeah pretty much I'm I just had a t-shirt made up so is that but I says you know AF at the bottom of it

Since discovering intersex 10 years ago Dane has become involved in the community rapping and traveling to conferences

490
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
I've actually would kick this whole password thing off

491
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
And in May of 2018 Dana and the state department were back in front of a judge arguing the case on its constitutional Mary

492
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:59,712
In September a judge ruled in favor of Dana saying that the federal government cannot refuse a passport based on face

493
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Sick identity

494
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
But two months later the state department appealed

495
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
Another round of oral arguments is expected this coming spring

496
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,768
