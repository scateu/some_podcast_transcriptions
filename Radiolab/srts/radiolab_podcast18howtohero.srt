1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:24,320
Hey this is Radiolab on Jedi Cam'ron I'm Robert krulwich topic today is goodness

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Goodness

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Selflessness

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Show me the map

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,536
Okay so you ready for this it's a while back we we did the story that

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
Brussels is really stuck in our heads

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
It was a story that was

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:42,496
Ask and it's really deep question and the answer that we got to answer didn't quite

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Click

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
Yeah it's so just assertive

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
Set the table the question was why do people

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Do good in the world

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,064
World so we ask that question look at it from the perspective of genetics computer science all kinds of things we ended up profile

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
3

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
Jordan Air

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Heroically good

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
People that were Heroes

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
Slate that remarkable things

22
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,352
We told her stories with that question in mind why do certain people do good in the world and others don't

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
Yeah so we can revisit that question today in the story that we told

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
Because I think we have something better and smarter to say about it finally something

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,872
Very peculiar to say about us it turns out.

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,944
First and then going to come back and hopefully sheds new light on

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
So

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Here we go

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
Again this story just began with a simple question

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
That question lettuce

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,072
Two guy named Walter Rutkowski executive director and Secretary of the Carnegie hero fund Commission

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
Cool thanks for doing this

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Can you just give us a little background on

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,472
The hero fund what is the Carnegie hero fund

35
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
The Carnegie hero fund is

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
Is a private operating Foundation

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,128
It was established by Andrew Carnegie in 1904

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
And what we do is recognize civilian heroism throughout the United States

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Canada

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
By giving an award called The Carnegie medal

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
And accompanying the Carnegie medal is a financial Grant

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
How much

43
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
Currently the amount is $5,000

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
And how do you guys choose Your Heroes

45
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
We judge the

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
Heroic acts against a list of

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Performance

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:20,544
So then you have to have some kind of definition of hero which includes some and excludes other yes

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Perfect basic definition

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Which is

51
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Civilian

52
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Meaning no military

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Who voluntarily to

54
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Leave the point of safety degree

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Risk his own life

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Apply for

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
To an extraordinary degree

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
To save or to attempt

59
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
To save

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
The life of another human

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
6

62
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,328
How about 7

63
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
Just came from memory so don't like it happens in a person's mind at that pivotal moment when they decide to voluntarily

64
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,336
Voluntarily leave a safety and risk their life to extraordinary degree

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
To save a life

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Another human that's what I wanted to know

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Treatise jumping

68
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Okay so the first one we have on our list is

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Is a loris

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Shrek okay

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Phone number 73546

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
And the award number is 8

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
8000 +

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
I am Laura shrake

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
I am from

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Mattoon Illinois and I

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Currently live in

78
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Dubai United Arab

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Laura spoke with our producer timeout okay so we're going back a little bit

80
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Yeah 15 years

81
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
Back in the mid-90s

82
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
21 year old College to

83
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
And I was driving through the country

84
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
And

85
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull

86
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
And attack

87
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Faster

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,880
She stopped to see what was going on and started yelling at her

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
To see what I could do

90
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
The woman was on the ground in the pool was

91
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Turn the air back on the ground while he was clearly struggling

92
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Side of the fence but

93
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Defense

94
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Was Electric

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
So here's the moment that we find fascinating

96
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
At this point Laura can either go forward through thousands of volts of electricity toward an angry bull that will lie

97
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Likely Mall her to or

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
She can stay safe

99
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
I went ahead and

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Just climb through the fence

101
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,471
And I don't remember ever feeling the electricity

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
She says by the time she got through

103
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,431
A neighbor has shown up in through or piece of pipe

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
The whole time she's yelling at me

105
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Hit the ball in the face as hard as

106
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
As you can and don't stop

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Shrek went up to the bull

108
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
And

109
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
Beat It repeatedly

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Which is 2 foot lengths of tubing

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
I think

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
It distracted the bull enough

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
Where she was able to get out from under him

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
And as soon as we are outside the fence

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Looking back into the past

116
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
The bull was literally right there

117
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Apus

118
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
Get the ground few times and snorted

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
He was not happy

120
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
To a question

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
When you were there at that fence

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
And

123
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
You had

124
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
The choice either stay put or to go through it

125
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
What was going through your mind when it was there calculation there

126
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
No

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Can't really say that

128
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
I mean you know your options or anything like that I did not know

129
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
It was just

130
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
Here's the problem

131
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Here's what I need to do

132
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Something needed to

133
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
So there's no choice moment

134
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Not that I recall

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
No

136
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,063
If nobody came to This Woman's rescue she would die

137
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Unfortunately

138
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
This is the usual explanation

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
I couldn't stand there and not

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Do any

141
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
I would like

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Repeal 2A

143
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
I didn't really take the time

144
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Think about

145
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
What else could

146
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
I can't say I ever really thought about loan

147
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,103
Okay we just jumped ahead cuz we thought we try again that's the voice of the next Carnegie hero that

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Walter told us

149
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Yeah William David Pennell

150
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
8306

151
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
60 second

152
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Person to receive the credit union

153
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
I producer Lynn Levy tracking down there can you hear me

154
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
William David Pennell

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,047
37 years old at the time of his heroic act 1999

156
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
I was

157
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,679
Early in the morning it was like 3:19 a.m. in a small town near pits

158
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Monongahela Pennsylvania

159
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
We was in bed sleeping in

160
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,639
My wife a lot crash I actually didn't hear it for the dog

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,735
On my one dog was carrying on so right away I buy run down there

162
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,831
Panel went outside his house there was a very bad automobile accident

163
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
A car crashed head-on into a utility pole was like Rippling up the windshield out from under the hood

164
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Did the same wearing only sweatpants no shoes or barefoot

165
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
So here we are standing in front of this ball of fire there are three teenagers inside that

166
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,919
Louis doesn't know it neither A or B

167
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Go into the driver's door

168
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
And it's big fella out the door so I reached out to hold of him around the chest

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
Pulling from the driver seat out to the ground meat on their car was just like Blazer

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
My neighbor was there to holler and there's more of them in there so I run back to the vehicle you found that the front seat passenger

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
It was trapped in the wreckage

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
Arthur young man entered the car third time by then it was tired

173
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
Ft above the car's roof

174
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:03,327
Screaming

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
But nobody nobody would help

176
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
In.

177
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,871
I reached in and grabbed the older the kid was in the back by the Scruff of the neck

178
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Alright so when you're coming out of your house

00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
Spend any looking at that car what was going through your head

180

I'm saying to myself you know

187
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
There's something golf

188
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
Forbid whatever happened to her

189
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
But I would hope someone would be there at the hell

190
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Do you ever talk to your neighbors and ask them

191
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Why didn't come in there

192
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
I know you know what that

193
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,991
Those funny you brought that up because now I've never never brought it up

194
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Never brought a

195
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
How come

196
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
I don't know

197
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Maybe I probably wouldn't like their answer

198
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
I don't know

199
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
I don't know why I've never asked

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
What do you think is the difference between you and those other people who just started

201
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Twisted by

202
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Are acronyms

203
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Aquaman trailer

204
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
So Arbol girl she didn't know

205
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
This guy didn't really know either

206
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Somebody must be able to tell us

207
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Something

208
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
About what they were thinking at that moment that

209
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Allow them the gave them the courage to do what they did I can't give you a definite answer as to what propels people to do this no

210
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
But we took one more shot with Walter and if we take a quick break we're going to here

211
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
One more hero story from him

212
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Come back

213
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
This is Sam calling from Denver Colorado

223
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

224
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
And I'm here because I need your help

225
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
And I request

226
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
For those of you who

227
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
Who spend a lot of time with kids parents

228
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Aunts and uncles

229
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
Teachers looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

230
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Brilliant

231
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Basically I want to hear about this

232
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
When a kid you know did something

233
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
It just means you lean back and say

234
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
How do they do that

235
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Maybe it was the moment that I

236
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,223
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

237
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
Or maybe the kid was a piano

238
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,879
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

239
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Or maybe the kids in math class

240
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

241
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
We're interested in the

242
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Epic moments where

243
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
A kid does something super smart

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
It doesn't have anything to do with it

245
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
If you have a story

246
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Go to radiolab.org

247

Robert Radiolab

254
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,935
We're back now with Walter Bukowski who's going to tell us the third and final of his Hero Stories We Tell

255
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Rid of all the cases he's heard

256
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
This is the one

257
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
The puzzles in the most

258
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
The case of Wesley James Autry

259
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
I-88 construction worker from

260
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
New York 50 year old man

261
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
Who did jump into the track that in a subway station

262
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
To remove

263
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
Hey fellow young man who had fallen onto

264
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
The track

265
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
The gentleman was

266
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
6 foot 280 lb

267
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
He was he was in Earth

268
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
And yet mister

269
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Ultra persisted despite

270
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Back to the train was coming

271
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,031
Their appointment was at least in my estimation where you would have to say

272
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
I have to get out of here

273
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Because I'm going to be killed

274
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
I'm not suicidal

275
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
But Mr Audrey didn't think that way

276
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
He and I parked in this

277
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
This manner

278
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
What he did was he lay at optiv

279
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Between the rails

280
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
While the train passed over them

281
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
In the farthest reaches of my imagination

282
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
I can see myself jumping onto a Subway track to attempt the rescue

283
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,679
What I can't see myself doing is lying atop the victim all the train passes over

284
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,871
Making the story even more nuts

285
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,735
When we finally met up with Wesley autrey on the platform where this incident happened

286
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
35th and Broadway

287
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Explain to us

288
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Des daughters

289
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
And

290
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
How old are you

291
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
Not at that time my daughter was

292
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
4 + 6

293
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
And

294
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Dismiss them there

295
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Should have picture

296
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Oh my God

297
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Super cute Robin one behind me a shoe key

298
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Envista baby sauce

299
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
So entertaining there in the sky starts convulsing and then eventually

300
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,383
Falls off the platform onto the tracks right of the train is

301
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
His choice of pretty Stark

302
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Northern state is complete stranger

303
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
He's got to leave his daughters behind

304
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Actually without a dad

305
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
I'm looking at him shaking and going into another seizure or some strange reason to voice out of nowhere they don't worry about

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,887
I don't worry about the daughters you can do that so he jumps

307
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Runs the guy

308
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
Is he conscious

309
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,711
Play slip I look up the train again clothes I grabbed his hand again will slip apart this rain is closer

310
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
50 feet 20 ft 10 ft and it's right there at all

311
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,255
The guy get him in a bear hug and flattened his body against the guy as much as he can

312
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
The first train called just graze my cat

313
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Train car went right over them

314
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
When the train came to a stop 45 carlls path over I look them in the eyes excuse me you seen that

315
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
I have a seizure or something I don't know you you don't know me so I just kept talking to him until he came through

316
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
And he was like well we have like we are looking for train he said what who are you I said I can't not to save your life so he kept asking

317
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
We are we dead I wouldn't have him I gave him a slight pinch on his arm he's at all just a see you you're very much alive

318
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Have you did you ever ask yourself at this point like what am I doing

319
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:39,359
What am I doing here what about you

320
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,711
Between-the-legs I can hear my daughter screaming so when that train come to a stop

321
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
Viola from underneath the train

322
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Excuse me I'm the father

323
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
We are okay

324
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
I just want to let my daughters know that that I'm going to tell you because I know that they are worried about me

325
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Everybody start clap

326
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Can I ask you a question

327
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
So it's

328
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
The point which

329
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
You said You Heard a Voice

330
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
That

331
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Said I can do that

332
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
I can do this

333
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
What's what is amazing to me

334
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,591
Is it you left your daughter's right here and dive after a guy you don't know

335
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
He was a stranger total stranger but you know what

336
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
The mission wasn't come completed

337
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
I was chosen for that

338
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
You felt shows like you were charged

339
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
I feel like I'm the chosen one

340
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Luther religious person though

341
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
I would plunder

342
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Why me

343
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Maybe 20 years ago

344
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
I was supposed to be

345
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
At a certain point

346
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
And then explain to us exactly why he jumped he was the one guy who could

347
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,871
He said right before his feet left the platform this one specific moment

348
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
From his life flash to mine

349
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
This thing to happen

350
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
I had a gun full to my temple but you know that it was a misfire so

351
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,463
A gun was put to your head and miss it so you are almost dead for almost dead

352
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,071
So you think you might have been spared for

353
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
After that moment he says when the gun went click

354
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
He didn't die

355
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
He always wondered

356
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Why had God spared him

357
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
That moment

358
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Until he was on the platform

359
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Guy fall off

360
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
He says when he knew

361
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,991
This is why I can do this you just I could do this I can do this

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
That boys when a boy said that you going to be okay I knew everything was going to work out

363
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
You know what I think

364
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
The end of the day

365
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,679
I don't think that there's an answer to the question we asked

366
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
I don't think you're a question

367
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,103
Why were you a hero I don't think that any three of these here I mean the last one had the longest explanation

368
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
He had been selected for some purpose but does he know why you lying I'm not a clue.

369
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
9/3 gives me some

370
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
What is he give you

371
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Okay so the first to write they have no idea

372
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
This is just something in them that made them at

373
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Pick a number 3

374
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Talking about circumstances

375
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
The world prepared him for that mower

376
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Serendipity

377
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Makes me think

378
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
What what if

379
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Circumstances are just right

380
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Tamela Mann

381
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
He used to say to me all the time usage

382
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
How did you make

383
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
I don't know if I could have done that

384
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
As well you know what

385
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Don't say you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do that

386
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Do your put in that situation

387
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Back when we asked Walter

388
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
How many nominations

389
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Do you get a year

390
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Are they hard to find

391
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
No they are not hard at all

392
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Defined

393
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
We are fortunate to be living in a society

394
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Regardless of what you hear elsewhere

395
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
We are fortunate

396
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
Society where people do Lookout

397
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
Others even strangers

398
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
He told us

399
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
They've even have to up their guidelines

400
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Make it harder to win

401
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
Simply because of the vast number for wrote Deeds

402
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Happening day-to-day life

403
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
I got to save it

404
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
We went with this feel good thought about

405
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,255
About all the people who are doing good because I honestly don't think we knew what to say

406
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,607
Say to end that story was nice to know there was a lot more good people than we thought

407
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
We went to we were trying to figure out why people

408
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
Why do people who do that do that and why we're different are there different than us at the end we didn't really get there

409
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
But then yeah

410
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
This guy walked

411
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
You should say

412
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319
I just for a business purposes who you are once again Robert sapolsky I'm a professor of neuroscience at

413
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Stanford University Robert has been on our program many many times talking about any number of things that you just come out

414
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,583
Out with a book called behave trying to explain why we do everything we do

415
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
Rain in the history of the culture everything

416
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
Maybe he would have something to say about it

417
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Puzzle

418
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,335
Yep I will it let me just let just ask you you've heard all three of these things

419
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
What does this what do these details make you think

420
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Think what we see

421
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
With all three

422
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
Is how highfalutin moral reasoning plays like zero role in what went on their moral reasoning

423
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Doesn't do anything

424
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Can You Stand The First

425
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
Think about it supposed to be told us which

426
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Is it

427
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
When we were asking people what were they thinking

428
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Serve the wrong question

429
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,239
And everybody else always gets the same answer we just

430
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
I wasn't thinking I was

431
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,895
Feeling about what if this were my sixteen-year-old daughter I hearing a voice or

432
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
With the bull woman sang I wasn't thinking

433
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
Like before I knew it I had jumped in

434
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
The evidence suggests

435
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
Sapolsky says that in situations like this

436
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
People just don't reason their way to a decision that's not how it works correct people don't think their way

437
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,607
Turn moral decision in fact you give people enough time to release

438
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,167
Think their way in a circumstance like that

439
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,007
Most people think their way to concluding this isn't my problem or

440
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Somebody else will take care of it work

441
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Here's why it's their fault

442
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,175
So that means I'm okay if it's not thinking or moral reason

443
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
Then maybe what these heroes are doing is they're their feeling

444
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
There there

445
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
They're empathizing more than the rest

446
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
That's why they do what they do

447
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
Ironically probably not

448
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
Probably not yeah

449
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
Okay Sue empathy your ear feeling somebody else's pain

450
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Weather

451
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
Paying your toes on fire or pain

452
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
Feeling the pain of somebody else

453
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Pain is painful

454
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:33,151
And if it's painful enough and acute and burning enough what that translates into

455
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Is

456
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
I can't take it this

457
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
Too upsetting and you need to run away

458
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Some point

459
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
If you were mostly focused

460
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,719
On my God what were this to be with this feel like if this were happening to me

461
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,863
That's the predictor of people who don't necessarily don't very readily make that leap

462
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
From feeling empathy

463
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
To actually acting compassionately

464
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,543
No that's not what I asked you to say I thought you were going to take it the other way

465
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Hot when it's memememememe at your pain is my pain

466
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
Those people are less likely to step forward

467
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Yeah

468
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
They're less likely to actually go into the compassionate thing

469
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,440
Suppose he told us that there have actually been studies that have found this

470
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
That win

471
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Someone

472
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Actually empathizes

473
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Physically feels another person

474
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Pain

475
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
They're more likely to turn away from it

476
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Rather than

477
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:31,776
Step forward and try and alleviate that person suffering you put somebody in a circumstance and for example how many shocks

478
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Really willing to get to intervene

479
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,408
To help somebody in some simulation

480
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Game for example

481
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,296
And you look at is this the person whose heart rate soars

482
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
When they see somebody else in this tough situation

483
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,464
Or is this the kind word remains fairly steady

484
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,792
The latter is more likely to act compassionately

485
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,888
So interest okay so what we're barreling towards here is

486
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
It's not so much about moral reasoning

487
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,824
It's not so much about new Fast empathy but it's about a type of empathy

488
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,408
That allows you to remain detached enough

489
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
I actually Act

490
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,064
So emotional distance will create the Humane or Charlack

491
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Exactly

492
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
You need a certain amount of detached

493
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
That's surprisingly where comes in

494
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
And that runs counter to so many of our instincts about what empathy should be about and what I think we see

495
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
See here is probably the most reliable Realm

496
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
People going into English heroic thing

497
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Which is when it's implicit

498
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
When it's automatic

499
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992
When it's not you sitting there reasoning through well how many coffees my jeans am I going to pass on if I do this for my

500
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
My close relatives

501
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
And where's not empathy

502
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
The hour

503
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,416
Feeling for this person or as this person or with this person or above the

504
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
And instead

505
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
Before I knew it

506
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
I jumped in the river to save this child

507
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
And I think that's where you see some of the most

508
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,912
Interesting reliably

509
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
24 Robux stuff

510
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
When it's implicit when it's

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
And you know how a person can

512
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Get that

513
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Kind of

514
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
Compassion made implicit is it

515
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,808
It is something you're born with or something cultural at your parents

516
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
Can you have any idea

517
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
The thing is

518
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
We don't know what

519
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
Hunt about the neurobiology of how

520
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
A moral good goes from being a frontal task

521
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
To an implicit task

522
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,216
But we know what time about how that works in a much more mundane area

523
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Which is like

524
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
You'll learn how to do something

525
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,896
Like you're a Pianist and you're learning some new top piece of music

526
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
This is really tough

527
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Trill

528
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
And every time you're playing it

529
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
As you approach the trill your thinking here it comes remember tuck your elbow and weed with your thumb

530
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Come and do this

531
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,768
It is what would be called a declarative task

532
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Claire's

533
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Explicit knowledge

534
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,448
And that's completely about this part of brain the hippocampus talkin the frontal cortex

535
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,848
And it's sitting there saying here it comes and remember how you do it and remember how you do it wrong what happened last time and

536
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,688
How great it felt when you talked to your elbow into remember to that and then

537
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Suddenly there's the day

538
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
We are playing the peace

539
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,624
And you realized your four measures passed the trill and you played it just fine

540
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
That's the first day you played it without having to think about it

541
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,048
And jargon in the learning field is it is stopped

542
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Being

543
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
An explicit

544
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Declarative task

545
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
And it's become an implicit

546
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Procedural tasks

547
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
That's the first

548
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Time

549
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Your hands know what better than your heads

550
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,664
Take somebody who's like beating the pants off of you at tennis

551
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,504
And they've just unlike some amazing backhand and crushed you

552
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
And what you need to do strategically now is

553
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
Force them to take that procedural knowledge and make it to Claret again

554
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Stop at that point you give him this

555
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Sequias

556
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Smile

557
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Cuz you're amazing

558
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
Tennis player that was amazing

559
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
How did you do that

560
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,496
Do you put your hand over on that side of the West Side what what about your butt

561
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
Scrunching your butt on the left side of the right

562
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,104
Any for some it's like you make somebody like

563
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Think very

564
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
Explicitly and procedurally how you go down flights of stairs and you're going to fall down the stairs because none of us have done stairs procedurally

565
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
Since we are about 2 and 1/2 years old

566
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:35,232
Swarmed over our threesome release the first two of our threesome they might have been ruined for the next experience

567
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
But if you let them do their natural thing

568
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Then they would rescue again maybe

569
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
If I could just keep it in place at

570
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Do you think that the simplicity

571
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,056
Do you think that that there's a clean dramatically analogy I mean do you think that

572
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Is that it

573
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
The people

574
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
For whom it is automatic

575
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
It's automatic.

576
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Because they practice

577
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
In the way that like the primes Subway

578
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Yeah freak zample Lots

579
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,184
Studies were done this to which people in

580
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
Either Germany or nazi-occupied

581
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Europe

582
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
Shielded Jews

583
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
Give them shelter but their own lives at risk

584
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
And it wasn't predicted by level of

585
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
Vacation there goes all that moral reasoning stuff

586
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
And it wasn't even protect

587
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Predicted by things like religiosity was

588
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
People who had simply been raised

589
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
You do the right thing

590
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
It was automatic

591
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
It was implicit for them

592
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
They didn't have to sit there

593
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
And

594
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Think about or feel about it was automatic

595
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,464
Is that thank you mommy and daddy is that what that is

596
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
Thank you mommy daddy Rabbi priest

597
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
What is that

598
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
I think it's mostly that

599
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,192
But of course it's messier than playing a Trill on a piano we're doing a 10 that I can

600
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Meet people first learned about it and

601
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,872
You literally can see the transition from which part of the brain's handling the task

602
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,712
To the initial view was okay that's how you do trill's on the piano

603
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
But then you see something even more amazed

604
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,392
Which has more complex stuff happens my my father

605
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
In his last years had

606
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Pretty severe dementia

607
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:16,352
He was as a professor or even an architectural historian and he reached a point where

608
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,752
He could not identify the names of all of this kids consistently didn't know where he was what decade excetera

609
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
But

610
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Crompton

611
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
And he could give you the

612
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,128
Totally Lucid opinionated

613
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,920
Frankie entertaining

614
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
10 minute lecture on the history of flying buttress

615
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
And

616
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,624
Then come back two minutes later and prompt them again and you give you the exact same one again

617
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
For him that was as implicit

618
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
As

619
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,024
The tennis player doing the backhand

620
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
Or playing the trolls on the piano when

621
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,168
I fully expect when I'm demented someday I'll give this exact

622
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,520
What sure that I just gave and I can do it over and over and over and students complain

623
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,408
So all sorts of stuff more complex than a tennis backhand becomes implicit

624
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,992
I think what we're seeing with the woman with the boulder in the elect

625
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Expense is

626
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Something

627
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Ratably

628
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
High-level abstract stuff

629
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
Becomes implicit as well

630
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,024
You don't like fling your elbow way out to the right when you do the trill

631
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,864
And you don't stand by and watch somebody being like done in

632
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
You just before you know it you don't reason you don't feel you just do it before I knew it I had to run in there

633
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,848
No is this one of your lectures do you talk about that this very thing love

634
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
Otherwise when we come and visit you in 13 years will you be treating us with this very

635
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Precisely

636
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,648
Empathy empathy is an interesting topic sit down this will be on the final

637
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680
Big big thanks to Robert sapolsky who's new book
