I woke up and it was raining

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Went to pick up my son from daycare

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
It's Always Alright

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Special moment when I

Pick him up and he sees me and he's happy

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,160

It was a hard day

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
And when I got home

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
I just

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352

I have somebody who loves me that way the moment that I felt gratitude

41
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
A little something different in my hair

42
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
And my coworker

43
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,832
First thing this morning it was so

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Sweet of her to notice

Great father day because my step dad is still alive and seeming to be recovering and

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
That is one of the best

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
Things I can say about today because it's been a really long hard week I'm on it when I felt grateful today

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
Sally's driving home tonight

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312

Hello I how did you get into all this

83
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
A good question as you know I'm not

84
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
One of you I am Canadian

85
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
So many very radio

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
That's right we are invading

87
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
And you know I moved to the states that you know a few years ago and you know when you go to new place and you able to

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
Turn around and look back at the old place and you kind of see it with Clarity Clarity of distant that's right

89
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,791
And there was this one moment that happened about a month after I got to America that just

90
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Turn off the mini butter doesn't really

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Rumi

92
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
What was

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
Will let me set up for you so it's so it's

94
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
May 18th 2016

95
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:06,431
George be open the Speaker of the House

96
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Order

97
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Alarm

98
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Kohl's the session into order

99
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
Cuz in the house that day

100
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
They're going to vote on a bill

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
So the speaker Rings is electric bill that let everyone know it's time to vote and as is Canadian tradition

102
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Do people notice

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,935
Walk up the aisle and then it is kind of bow and then the voting can begin

104
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
But for this particular approach the liberal whip guess the front and he turns it was right and he did not see that

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Gordon Brown

106
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,503
He's like where is this man and he turns left behind me see is a Gordon Brown has tried his very best

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
To make his way to the front of the house

108
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
But he is stuck

109
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
And you stuck because

110
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
There is a clump

111
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Of MPS

112
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
They're standing in his way

113
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Purposefully or just accidentally I think it's debated but I would say very confidently that it was extremely

114
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Purposeful

115
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,639
They're pretending they don't see him and they're using their little their butts like shuffling their butt and you can see he's like dodging this way

116
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
Ellen scaring that way and then it's kind of complicated

117
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Basically we have

118
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
3 minutes we have a deadline

119
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Sears washing machine

120
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
It's ridiculous and I sort of hate everything

121
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:29,375
And then you see the front of the room this figure

122
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Stance

123
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
All

124
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847
Dressing a three piece suit

125
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Fittingly handsome very nice hair

126
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,295
Disfigure strides towards this Clump get three piece suit flapping open

127
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
The cowlick of his hair moving in the breeze of his own motion

128
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,583
Justin Trudeau playing games on the road

129
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
He pushes his way

130
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
Through this collection of people and in this moment I am cheering for Trudeau yes you are

131
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
You're making government happened get the vote done

132
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,967
So Trudeau grabs Gordon Brown by the arm

133
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
But in doing so he elbows

134
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
This woman doesn't see behind them in Cebu

135
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Yeah

136
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
Did she go with some pain she grabs her chest and she has to leave and sitting

137
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
And collect yourself

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Trudeau sees none of this

139
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
And I at East riding up yellow bile with little Gordon until there is a

140
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Chaos

141
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
Erupting in house Trudeau turns around

142
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
Can you learn you just elbowed this woman in the chest and you can see he's got this mortified look on his face he buttons

143
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:02,815
Three-piece cutie strides after her called it something like I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't see you I didn't see you

144
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
She's gone though at this point one of the other members does beckoning

145
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,615
Jim how could you ever loved a woman that's pathetic

146
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
You're pathetic really ridiculous

147
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Speakers like Bose order order order

148
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:33,023
Order

149
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
Order members will.

150
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Amber Silver Strand themselves

151
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
So is it down

152
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
Order to the Prime Minister Rising on this serious matter

153
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,783
I admit I came I in physical contact

154
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,135
Number of members as I extended my arm in

155
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Including

156
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
At someone behind me who I did not say apologize again

157
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Anyone feel that they were

158
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
Impacted by my actions I

159
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Completely apologize I was not my intention to hurt anyone and certainly wasn't

160
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
This down his whole side of the room stands up give him a standing ovation but for the opposition the people

161
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Other side of the aisle

162
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
This is not good enough

163
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Across the floor

164
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
With anger fear in his eyes and face member after member rise from their seats to school

165
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
Add my testimonies are the conservatives thinking with Glee

166
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
I would use the word charge

167
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Across the floor Whittington people of clutching their pearls with the light Justin is not the perfect

168
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Perfect man that we all thought he was

169
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,879
Someone accused of making it unsafe place for women to work

170
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Best made of steel

171
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,399
Eventually

172
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
I was remembering question

173
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,775
The woman who was elbowed Ruth Ellen brosseau she returns and she speaks

174
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
I was elbowed in the chest

175
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
By the primary

176
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
It was very overwhelming

177
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,015
I just wanted to clarify and make sure it's clear to all the members in the house if that did happen

178
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
At which points Trudeau again stands up and says what I think is a pretty nice apologies

179
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Take the opportunity at now that the member

180
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,887
It is okay to return to the house right now to be able to express directly to her

181
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Apologies

182
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
Up for my behavior unreservedly

183
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
He says what he did he says it was wrong

184
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
And he says

185
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
I'm very sorry

186
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Thank you mister speaker

187
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
We got the idea now he said it three times

188
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Will you think so

189
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Right

190
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Something that can be cured by a simple apology

191
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
But that wasn't the case that night at a press conference

192
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:15,071
And indeed I'm going to apologize again for incident in the house

193
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
This evening he does it again

194
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
And for that I truly regret that at this point the media is going crazy about it

195
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
Day of atonement

196
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
#elbow elbow Gates

197
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
Trudeau got on social media added apologetic tweet

198
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
Just in case but even then we're still not done because the next day back in the House of Commons

199
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,767
He apologizes again

200
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
I apologize for crossing the floor in his attempt

201
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Take a seat

202
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,215
And again

203
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
And again

204
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Against

205
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
Apologizing and again

206
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
I regret it

207
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Deeply

208
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
I made a mistake and

209
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Again

210
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Canadian

211
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Understanding and

212
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,719
I think at this point when I was learning about these I was just like okay

213
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
I just I just feel like I guess I just feel like

214
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
This posturing end

215
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
Volume like for Canada it's not just about

216
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Elbow thing

217
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Feel like every month Trudeau is apologizing to one group or another that has been harmed in the past by Cannon

218
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
And you know I should say that actually think he's apologies are very helpful and I think it's very important but you get to a point where they just

219
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,087
Start to pile up and I so I guess like what I'm seeing Alba gate

220
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
I'm noticing elbowgate I'm thinking about all of this

221
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
Attending to come here

222
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
Do America where where we have this President Donald Trump tonight he's refusing

223
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
To apologize for anything

224
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,007
Is there anybody you'd like to apologize to know

225
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
Funny weird things

226
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
Give me a moment in that tiny tiny moment the contrast was

227
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Refreshing

228
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
What colloquial

229
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
At least I know where you stand that's so funny because as you're telling the story about Canada on the apology is none like

230
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Oh my God I would

231
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
We haven't apologized in this country for some really wrong stuff that I'm not down

232
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
Not apologizing for stuff but then again we had one too many glasses of wine and we are so

233
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Sorry

234
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
Show me the days are just like nothing says sorry like free pizza story not story

235
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
Sorry if you felt hurt I'm sorry if I offended you if you're not real

236
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Broken

237
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Sorry

238
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Yeah

239
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
And I guess I could

240
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
Found myself getting to this whole thing about like

241
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
How to figure out first of all

242
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
How did it get broken how to re break it

243
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
End

244
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
What can we do to get it back

245
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Yeah well maybe it

246
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
It might be worth our time to back up a little bit to get aware that notion of I'm sorry and apologies come from

247
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
And what they are because take me back

248
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,879
I'm the chair of the floss department at the University of New Hampshire

249
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,207
He's an expert in the history and philosophy of contrition

250
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
We got these

251
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Ancient traditions

252
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
Usually grounded and some kind of religious

253
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Practice

254
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
Pretty much all the world religions have some kind of repentance

255
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Tencent

256
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Turn to God never again

257
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,159
You do something wrong and wrong is identified by you know whatever the holy book say whatever and you say there are some

258
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,535
There's some things you need to do that kind of make it right

259
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,863
Admit to regret to ask for forgiveness than to promise never to do it again

260
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
Ain't no repentance is the term that

261
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,055
Is around for most of the history of apologizing and when you think of it in those

262
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Explicitly religious terms you kind of get a sense for the

263
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Full thickness of it because you're talking about like

264
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Your soul

265
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
And the afterlife

266
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
And you're standing

267
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Before the gods and not just the person you injured right this is

268
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Soul crafting

269
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
As we enter

270
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Modern secular

271
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Industrialized living

272
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,055
And as we try to find a way to to do something like repentance

273
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
In a secular terms we end up with this

274
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Weird modern soup

275
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
Of apology

276
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,575
So Nick says overtime as we started letting go of he's like explicitly religious rules around apology

277
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
Sori sort of started to shift

278
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
And fuse

279
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
In that context is everything alright so what

280
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
In Modern Life do we mean

281
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Alright what's a good apology what do we mean by apologies

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
This is going to be super complicated

283
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Like when we've been hurt

284
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
To buy someone

285
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
What is it we actually want

286
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,127
And as I was looking around for stories about the role of apologies our lives today

287
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
I found

288
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
A moment that feels to me like

289
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
I like almost sort of inflection points

290
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
In a Reckoning with the meaning of

291
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
I'm sorry

292
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,927
Inserts oddly enough

293
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
With this guy

294
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Hello

295
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Hello are you there

300
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Hello

00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Hi there

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Can you hear me

303
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Governor Dukakis

304
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Hello hi

305
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,735
Don't like Michael Dukakis that's who that is

306
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
What

307
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
Know who Mike Dukakis was before doing a story I had no idea

308
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
Olympia Dukakis his cousin before God

309
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
React

310
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
That's okay

311
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Let me get it give you a tiny little background

312
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
I was actually calling him about something that it happens like a couple years

313
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Before he ran for president that was a long time ago and it's not that I'm losing my memory book that was a long time ago

314
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,159
When you've had a pretty eventful life so I wasn't sure whether or not this was the most

315
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Memorable

316
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Moment

317
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,583
Just watching yeah yeah this might have been the second most yeah

318
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
So back in 1986 he was governor of Massachusetts and he had a bill sitting on his desk

319
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Window design

320
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Do you remember this

321
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
I do indeed

322
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,431
That was the day before Christmas the 24th of December so the bill itself

323
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,319
It had a lot to do with a state senator today bill saltonstall

324
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Did I know Bill songs not personal oh yeah oh yeah we work closely together bill was a very pretty

325
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Progressive Republican

326
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
One of us decent people I'd ever

327
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
Beto work with in politics

328
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
And

329
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
I can tell you he was suffering

330
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Terribly he and his

331
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Wife and family

332
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Yeah

333
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Yeah

334
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
I

335
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
I never really knew

336
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,039
Exactly what happened I mean I would prefer to pick up Snippets and try to

337
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Imagine what happened

338
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,975
This is Abigail saltonstall send your bill saltonstall as youngest daughter you know we weren't a family that talked

339
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
About the circumstances

340
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
In detail

341
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
But I'll see I was 12

342
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,703
Older sister Clara just had a birthday she had just turned 16 to what

343
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
White athletic long hair blue eyes and she has asked permission to bike down to Woods Hole

344
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
With the boyfriend

345
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,783
There's going to be a long ride like 70 some miles but for clear that really wasn't that big of an ass

346
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
She used to Bicycle to school

347
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
You know like

348
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
10 miles

349
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
And stop at the beach and when it was really cold and swim with her friend and then go to school

350
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
She was adventurous and she did love

351
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
2 bike

352
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
And I am not sure where they started I am

353
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
Thinking maybe somewhere near Boston

354
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Did you call

355
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Bikes for a couple of hours

356
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
The bike ride from Sherwood

357
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Exciting in

358
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
It Adventure but

359
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
They had got turned onto a wrong road

360
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
And I mean he got luck

361
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
And

362
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
My understanding of what happened over biking down the road on the shoulder there were two cars that were

363
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Maybe

364
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,839
Maybe playing chicken maybe racing I'm not really sure

365
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
But the cars

366
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
One of them

367
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
Look into the breakdown Lane and just

368
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Took out my sister

369
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
And she died

370
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
It's always awful

371
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Who is awful

372
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
Do you remember where you were when you heard about your sister's death

373
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah I was at

374
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
A friend's house

375
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,391
And then my father called and told me what happened

376
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
How I found out

377
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Well over the phone

378
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Dad over the phone

379
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Yes

380
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
To lose a daughter in on the prime of Life 16 years evasion

381
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Although circumstances

382
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
So tragic

383
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Can you can imagine

384
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Billava Sleepless

385
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Was devastated

386
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,479
Eventually the song Sail found out who the driver was this 19 year old guy

387
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
And the publisher of taking him to court

388
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
And one

389
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Easily

390
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
My memory

391
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
Is that my family did not press charges

392
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
My father says

393
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
That he didn't see a reason to ruin to life

394
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
But what he did at some level want

395
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
Was was just for this guy to reach out to the family

396
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Who caused her death

397
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
To say

398
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
To say that they were sorry

399
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,895
But he never contacted them so I never knew

400
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Weather person thought

401
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
And some point

402
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,807
My father told me that he that he thought that that was

403
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Because they

404
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
The law

405
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,696
That's right the driver is afraid of the legal implications of an apology

406
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
This is Lisa Lisa

407
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
He's a lawyer and a graduate of Harvard Divinity School

408
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
And he says that

409
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
At that point pretty much across the entire

410
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Tire us

411
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,472
The general rule of law was that if I run a red light

412
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,872
Can I get out of my car and I sent any I'm so sorry it was entirely my fault I was not paying attention I was talking on my

413
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
My cell phone

414
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
You can use

415
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Mike

416
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
Apology

417
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
To establish that I caused the accident

418
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
So you're Humane empathic reflexes might steer you towards you know saying you're sorry

419
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,584
It was my fault I wasn't looking or I was wiping my kid's nose or something

420
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
But

421
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
The takeaway is wait don't do that

422
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Because if you

423
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
In that moment

424
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Apologize

425
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
American Seating

426
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,872
But that you deserve the blame

427
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,456
In other words in the eyes of the Court apology is an admission

428
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,088
And don't sell thought maybe the driver of a car isn't apologizing because he's afraid that would use it against them in court

429
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,160
So we figured was Rectify this situation

430
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Let's just change the law which brings us back.

431
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
It was in response to that

432
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
Not Bill sitting on Governor Dukakis

433
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
It was

434
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,472
Designed to make it possible for people to apologize

435
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Without implicating them

436
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,360
As guilty party

437
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,712
I'm sorry that story cannot be used against you in court

438
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
Which only makes sense to me and I think made sense just about everybody and I don't think they had much difficulty in getting through those

439
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Unanimous

440
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Too close to it

441
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,000
And so December 24th 1986 Massachusetts passed the first

442
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Apology legislation

443
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,888
Creating For the First Time the song window that allowed two people to just

444
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
Do people enjoy I'm sorry

445
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
Without any legal consequence

446
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
Do you have any sense of

447
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,664
Whether or not that measures had any effect did you do you hear of it coming up

448
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
I honestly don't know

449
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
I don't know

450
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
I mean I don't know

451
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,624
You know the person even after the law was passed did not apologize

452
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
So it didn't accomplish that

453
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Specific goal

454
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
I actually found and reached out to the driver

455
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
And through his son he declined to comment for the

456
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Story

457
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
So didn't work

458
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
I never got their apology

459
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
Well at me for Abigail and her family know

460
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
But what I dug in the history of this

461
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
A bit what became clear was it this

462
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
Little drop

463
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Of legislation

464
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Created some ripples that are still spreading today

465
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Because it is wake

466
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Other dates

467
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
Start to pass legislation

468
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,560
But in the late 90s

469
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,424
The I'm sorry Bill and then in the early 2000 you see a big

470
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
First this is Jennifer ravenel's professor of law in Psycho

471
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Ecology at the University of Illinois

472
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:21,504
According to her one after another states started passing these kinds of rules

473
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Nebraska Colorado does organized

474
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,560
Dakota Tennessee plate variations from state-to-state but by 2012

475
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
36

476
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Of the states that passed one of these laws

477
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,728
Making it okay to say I'm sorry

478
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,592
But now you know that you're saying it without having to

479
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
To pay the consequences

480
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,200
You feel like that make it less real to say sorry yes that's

481
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
That's

482
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
That's not apologizing

483
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,416
What if you don't say you're sorry because you feel like that I'm going to sue you

484
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Until you say nothing

485
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
But isn't it better to have

486
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:09,120
Sorry at least come out even if the sorry little bit less with sorry that point yeah so that's the rub

487
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,472
Write give on the one hand what you want is a mechanism to

488
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Encourage

489
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
Good apologies

490
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
On the other hand

491
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
You know what wait a minute

492
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:25,504
An apology tells us that this person is responsible if they are responsible than

493
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
You know perhaps

494
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,344
One of the things that comes with that is responsibility to

495
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Repair the harm

496
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Yeah this is

497
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
This is a real double-edged sword

498
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Because

499
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
If you're a sophisticated

500
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Offender

501
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
You can manipulate the

502
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
Against victims to great effect

503
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
Think of it like this

504
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
You've suffered a serious injury

505
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
Imagine like you be like you wants to tile

506
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Nick says what happens

507
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
Is that the people responsible for that death may be accompanied by a lawyer what they do is they show up at your house

508
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
Sit down at your table and express

509
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Something that looks like

510
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Like a really deep

511
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
Profound

512
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Soul moving

513
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Apology that

514
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,728
They're really sorry for what happened and they take responsibility for it and they admit blame

515
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
And honest

516
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,848
But nix's often times has a combination of loitering

517
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Enacting

518
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Because

519
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
Once you express enough sympathy than you

520
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
You make an offer

521
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
And you know you lowball

522
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,648
So victims think they're getting something like a heartfelt repentance or something like that new Fender

523
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
When facts negotiation negotiation dressed up as an apology

524
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,144
How do you know that that's the line of thinking I've been in the other rooms

525
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
You know where the strategies are

526
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
Being discussed of the apologizes

527
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Yes

528
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:57,408
And Nick says overtime lawyers have realized by going to people's homes

529
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Listening sympathetically

530
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
And offering amount

531
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
This is way more cost

532
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
In fact

533
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
One of the major supporters behind that

534
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,744
Groundswell of apology laws in America for lobbyist

535
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
A lobbyists

536
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Who advocate for

537
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
Corporate interests who seek

538
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
To reduce

539
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Liability for Harms

540
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Really

541
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
So sorry got weaponized

542
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Yeah particularly by Corporation

543
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
Nick says in the early 90s

544
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
Also

545
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
Sorts of

546
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
Industries

547
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,480
Started apologizing as a tactic

548
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Tell me about one company he said he'd

549
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
In eight years they save 75 million

550
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
S*** and

551
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,464
If you want to follow the money that it's pretty easy to follow the money here

552
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
I'm suddenly

553
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,840
Who suddenly starting to argue the other side of my head which is

554
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,936
Isn't isn't a fundamental aspect in an apology like you're making yourself

555
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Smaller or vulnerable to the person you're apologizing to

556
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Not legal repercussions I hate that the laws involved but it is

557
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,992
And they're doing it for their own Financial benefit

558
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Then

559
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
They're not actually making themselves vulnerable to the person

560
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
And so the

561
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
The apology is robbed of something essential Maybe

562
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah

563
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
I don't know that IMAX imagine if your corporation

564
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
You can stay

565
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
It's still a human woman

566
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,288
Be even then you don't even if it seems like you're going well you never know

567
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
I don't know

568
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:34,432
Like that is the thing it all comes down to you when they say they're sorry

569
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Do they mean it

570
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,040
And usually can't really judge someone's apology until like years later

571
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,440
And actually Nick told me a story that really drive this point home so this is a really interesting example

572
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
So

573
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,632
So it's 1076 where in medieval Europe Henry the fourth is

574
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
The Holy Roman Emperor

575
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
And Gregory 1/7

576
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Is

577
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
Hope you love the most powerful people on the planet

578
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
And at some point the emperor goes behind the folks back

579
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
And appoints a bishop

580
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
The pope takes particular issue with disappointment

581
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
So what the pope does

582
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,368
Is excommunicates the emperor

583
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
Which means that

584
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:23,072
I mean he's not really the emperor anymore because the pope has just said he's not part of the church anymore

585
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
Really bad news

586
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,728
Violence is breaking out people are demanding he step down

587
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
The emperor does Henry

588
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
Henry takes a walk

589
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Lacrosse

590
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
The Alps

591
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
With his wife

592
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,784
And small child and I know who else is in there their Entourage

593
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Edison winter

594
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,160
It's bitterly cold they March for days and days which are in two weeks

595
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
The week

596
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
Through snowy valleys across icy rivers and because he's been excommunicated there

597
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,960
He can't go so they have to make take like the most dangerous mode

598
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Approach

599
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Across the aisle

600
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
And then finally after months of travel

601
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
He arrives

602
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,600
And it's some sort of Castle he arrives at where the Pope

603
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Is staying but

604
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
The Pope

605
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
Refuses the emperor entry

606
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,584
It is allegedly snowing and something like a blizzard

607
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
Standing at the gates of this gas at the gates

608
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
In a blizzard

609
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,240
In a blizzard with his wife and small child

610
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
He stands there

611
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
3 days

612
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
3 days

613
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Fasting

614
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,528
And the eight I decided to use there's my paintings of this and he's

615
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,600
He said to have taken a penitent posture

616
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Start again

617
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,488
The bottling position in a sentence feeling he's wearing a hair shirt

618
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,608
Which is traditionally associated with repentance and supposed to be painful and

619
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,704
It said that all his family take off their shoes in the snow

620
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
It's about the pope as watching this

621
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
From the castle from his nice toasty Council

622
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
And of course we have to keep in mind right that

623
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
And there are long traditions

624
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Within

625
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Christianity

626
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
We must forgive

627
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
So after 3 days

628
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Of watching this

629
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Republic

630
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,376
The emperor and his Entourage in they reconcile Henry's back in are you back in the church

631
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
Apology accepted okay so then that's a very good apology I got to say

632
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
Story's not over

633
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,408
Barefoot in the snow the family

634
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
Also using his kid this is I want to warn against the temptation to judge apologies in the moment they're given because now I would have

635
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Queso dampers

636
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Races back home

637
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
Civil Wars I breaking out

638
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
The emperor

639
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,352
Wednesday Civil Wars and drives out

640
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
And replaces him

641
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
What does own guy

642
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
So

643
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
What do we actually make of The Emperor's apology

644
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
He did something very

645
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
Dramatic

646
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
And spectacular

647
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
2

648
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
Restore his power

649
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
That he then used

650
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,112
To destroy the person he was apologizing to

651
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
When was God thought of all this

652
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
Psycho brother

653
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Matt idle

654
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,168
I feel like I'm never going to trust and another apology again

655
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Butts

656
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,984
Let's take a little break

657
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,056
I'm working take a little break and when you come back

658
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
I know I guess I feel like I've got an apology that

659
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Despite

660
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
Being at the very center of all this competing stuff even talking about modern corporate legal secular

661
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Stuff

662
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't know

663
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
It doesn't mean that I really didn't expect

664
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
I will be right back

665
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,840
This is Melissa Gutierrez in Evergreen Colorado

666

Modern world more information about Sloan at www.slha.org

669
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,040
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

670
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
And I'm here because I need your help

671
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
And I request

672
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,840
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

673
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
About what we're calling

674
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
Tiny moments of brilliance

675
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,264
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

676
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,664
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

677
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,248
Kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

678
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
Or maybe the kid was a piano

679
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,160
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

680
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,768
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

681
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
We're interested in the

682
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Epic moments where

683
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,960
A kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test

684
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
If you have a story with us

685
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336

Hopefully rescuing it from The Quagmire in which you left us with that Pope thing

693
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:02,272
Kind of dark space and that's how I was in the psych muddy state of apologies what are we doing with this word

694
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,064
Then I stumbled across this

695
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
This one story and things that started to shift

696
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Hey Annie

697
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,048
I've got a microphone in my front of my face so fun the lucky

698
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
How much does an ice cream cone or something

699
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
Doppia

700
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Is Leilani Schweitzer

701
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
Right or a shot of tequila right now in 2003

702
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
Leilani was living in Reno Nevada

703
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Json

704
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,456
Name Gabriel he was born on December 21st

705
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
I remember it

706
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
Knowing and like looking out the window of the nursery and

707
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
Christmas was playing on the radio in there

708
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
Just like the one and just thinking like

709
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
What has happened here

710
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,360
When Gabriel was born the doctors had learned that there was something wrong with it

711
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Brain

712
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
But they didn't know what yet

713
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,296
I remember I got to go home pretty quickly I don't think I stayed there even a day

714
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
And then I would go back

715
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,208
Can see him know so he had to stay there yeah they nearly had a brain bleed and so they've got to look at

716
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
What does kids

717
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
What did you do for Christmas

718
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Do you celebrate Christmas

719
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Did celebrate Christmas

720
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:24,960
You know what I hardly remember at all

721
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
After couple weeks Leilani was allowed to take him home

722
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,896
And for the first little while everything was pretty normal

723
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Diapers

724
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Long nights

725
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,320
Yep pretty normal baby days and then he ended up where he was diagnosed

726
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,208
With hydrocephalus when he was 4 month old hydrocephalus what it is basically it's

727
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
Fluid around the brain as someone says you can called water on them

728
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
When you hear your kid has hydrocephalus

729
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,656
What is that how do you envision that their future

730
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
I remember the neurosurgeon

731
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,800
And saying that he's never going to play football and he's never going to be drafted into the army

732
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Which

733
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Sounds great yes

734
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Winning right

735
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,528
It's not that serious me not necessarily but the kids is hydrocephalus like

736
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
You know they have problems

737
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Vision problems with balance

738
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,744
And after the single to shunt which is sort of a tube that acts like a siphon so it would drain off the excess flow

739
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Fluid in his brain and drain it down into his belly

740
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
Wow and I could feel it like on the side of a

741
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
His neck and

742
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,960
He had a little tiny incision on his tummy where they

743
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Hold it down

744
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
So the shunt it seemed to do the trick

745
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,664
Gabriel's doctors were so pleased with his progress that we went to have an ultrasound done and

746
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
The doctor told us

747
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
That

748
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Our baby

749
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Had

750
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
The actress starred in a commercial with the local hospital

751
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
That was very sweet

752
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Sweet commercial

753
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
We can help babies

754
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Before they're born

755
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Tiny little baby with a

756
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,072
Scrap of blond hair up being held by a laughing doctor

757
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
They've made

758
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
Feel like Celia Lonnie talking about her experience

759
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,776
Commercial actually ends with Gabriel

760
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
A huge smile on his face

761
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
Kind of kicking up his legs and and scooting across

762
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
Hospital logo baby

763
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
This is undeniably a very

764
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Kit

765
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
She would let anyone hold him

766
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
His arms were always reaching out to people and so it wasn't unusual for him to get passed around

767
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
Making the line at the grocery store or

768
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
Seriously oh yeah because he did actually have problems with vision he would always put his hand on your face

769
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Some kind of like turn your face

770
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,056
I don't know if he was doing that so if he

771
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
See you better or if he just kind of wanted that was just

772
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
It's a little

773
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,456
Like I'll touch you on your cheek and nuts

774
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Great

775
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
Like my little sweet blessing I don't know but

776
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
He would do that and

777
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
And people would recognize him

778
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
And people would say oh he's the miracle baby and

779
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
I can't he is

780
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
When did you first notice that there was a

781
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Problem

782
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
Thursday I remember is a Thursday Gabriel was 20 months old and I had been told

783
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,384
That if he started throwing up to take him to the emergency

784
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
State Department

785
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
And

786
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
He was throwing up alot

787
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,856
A lot he had no fever he didn't have diarrhea but he was throwing up alot to come to a nearby house

788
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:26,208
Hospital rejected the first of two hospitals that will play a role in this story but

789
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,072
Anyway when she got in there the rest of my fleet Haley took an x-ray and everything looked fine

790
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,376
So he ends up being hospitalized

791
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:38,496
Treated for stomach flu given anti-nausea medication

792
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,056
He was still really sleepy

793
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
And

794
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
I had a previously

795
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
We scheduled an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Monday afternoon this was

796
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
4 days later

797
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,832
I walked in and my mom was holding Gabriel and dr. Edwards

798
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Takes one look at him

799
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
And he said why did no-one call me

800
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,000
What was he seeing

801
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,328
He just saw a really sleepy beautiful little

802
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,936
Sick baby immediately knew that something had gone wrong with the shunt

803
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
The fluid was building up and Gabriel's brain

804
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
And

805
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Then it was

806
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Bad

807
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,784
Leilani needed to get him to a specialist fast so she she put them in a car seat in the back of her car and drove all the way

808
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Stanford

809
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
5 hours away

810
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
Yeah and he sounded like a little kitten

811
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Kind of like

812
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
Mm Ewing like not really crying

813
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
But just

814
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
And I remember getting

815
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
Stuck on the Bay Bridge

816
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,800
And just wondering can the Navy Seals come rescue me I have this is a traffic jam near 2nd

817
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Yeah

818
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Cod

819
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Yeah

820
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,968
Did you make it to the hospital to check in and get a room

821
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Finally Leilani just

822
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Allows yourself

823
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,184
Take a breath so you were sitting in a chair that was like right next to his bed or you given enough

824
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
You were okay

825
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,280
Just like a regular one that would like

826
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,376
One of those turquoise blue naugahyde recliners you know like

827
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
You're sitting straight or your lying down

828
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
Gabriel's lying in bed

829
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
We were on the Telemetry unit so that means they're monitoring his heartbeat and is breathing really closely so we had

830
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
At the little monitors on him

831
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
He falls asleep

832
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
And so does she

833
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:32,928
But any time there would be any change in his breathing or his heart rate or any even little kind of

834
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Twitch

835
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
These alarms on the monitors would just go off

836
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
Like I would wake him up and it would make

837
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Be up to nurse would come in

838
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Check him

839
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
Make sure everything's okay

840
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
Leave the room and

841
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,384
Just as they were settling back into sleep

842
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,015
This this kept happening over and over and over again

843
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
And so the nurse

844
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,647
When I think about her now I think of like a bird

845
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Leica

846
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,999
Like a swallow one of those really like

847
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Bass

848
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
Moving

849
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,863
Birds that's really Nimble and

850
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
And quick and can

851
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
Switch Direction

852
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Really fast

853
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
Because she was

854
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
In and Out In and Out in and out

855
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
So much and now I know

856
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,199
But she was taking care of another really really sick little girl

857
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
And taking care of Gabriel and I at the same time

858
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Sochi

859
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,367
She said I'm going to turn off the

860
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
The sound on the alarms

861
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
Understand turn the sound off

862
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Thin hair which I

863
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
Really appreciated and I thank

864
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
Turf or that

865
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
Because I really wanted to go see

866
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Sleep

867
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
So I fall asleep

868
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
And

869
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
And then the next thing I remember is she walks in and she grabs the foot of the recliner

870
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
With her left hand as she's walking past me and she's

871
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Swings it around

872
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
And she said Leilani you have to get up

873
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
She could see the flat lines

874
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
On the monitor

875
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Because his heart had stopped

876
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Speeding

877
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Then

878
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Code blue is on the intercom and Q

879
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
Hooked to machines and he's not

880
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
Squeezing my hand and he doesn't

881
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Feel warm and

882
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
And someone

883
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Takes me out and I'm in the hallway and

884
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
You know I don't know I don't know if I thought about this

885
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:40,159
Later or if I thought about it in in the time you know how you go back and you

886
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,535
You're sure you remember something in the moment but I don't know that I remember this in

887
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,655
I remember just kind of this like him saying goodbye to me

888
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
At that time

889
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Really

890
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Yeah

891
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
What what do you mean

892
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Kind of like

893
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
Like this gentle sort of

894
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
Like this is up to you now Mom

895
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
You know

896
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,135
I mean you're connected right it really connected

897
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
And when part of that connection

898
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Is gone you feel that

899
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,199
Leilani says in the wake of Gabriel's death

900
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
She's all the regular things you do when someone dies

901
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Therapy

902
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
And in her case

903
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
A lot of snowboarding

904
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
Snowboarding

905
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Yeah

906
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Yeah

907
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,023
White snow and blue sky was

908
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
All that really could compute

909
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
But she said in those first few days and weeks

910
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
Following Gabriel's death

911
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,751
She just kept playing over and over in your mind

912
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,335
What went wrong what what happened at those two Hospital

913
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Yeah

914
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,479
So the first hospital where Gabriel shunt failure was misdiagnosed as stomach

915
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
This is the hospital where

916
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
The nurses

917
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Parents

918
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,695
The commercial was for this Hospital commercials just stopped

919
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Wow

920
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
What is so then yeah what happened next

921
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Nothing happened

922
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:32,031
She just basically heard nothing from them how did it feel when you were shut out like that

923
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
What made me really angry

924
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
It made me feel like they

925
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,015
Where did nine that Gabriel even existed or that his life had any importance at all

926
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
The fact that

927
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
He died

928
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
That

929
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
Wasn't enough reason for them to

930
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
To talk to me I just

931
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:57,375
It still makes me angry you know I wouldn't I would purposely drive around the house

932
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
Hospital I would not drive past it so I reached out to this hospital for comment and they act

933
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
Declines to get one so I can't be sure but part of the reason they made out of reach out to Leilani

934
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:15,295
Is because it's hospital is located in Nevada and Nevada is one of those states that

935
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
Does not have apology legislation

936
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
So you're not protected if you apologize

937
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,951
But California

938
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
Does have a lot

939
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
So under the California lot you can say things like

940
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
I'm sorry

941
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:31,679
I feel bad a bee cannot say I'm sorry it was

942
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
Our fault we made a mistake

943
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
That parking still be used against you in court

944
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Brings us to the second house

945
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
Stanford

946
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,247
Reach out to me right away they invited her back to the hospital I had a lot of

947
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,807
Questions and I brought all of them I like print

948
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:53,183
It's about loud I had photos of Gabriel So at 2 months after Gabriel died

949
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
Leilani carrying these photos

950
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
Walked into Stanford

951
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
Do you remember what the expression on her face was

952
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Just

953
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Caprese chicken

954
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
This is Pam Wells you know you just

955
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
There's a look about people are crazy stricken

956
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,871
At the time and was head of nursing at Stanford

957
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
Not day she two doctors in a hospital administrator set down around a table with Leilani

958
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,623
The small table that could have said maybe eight people have you ever met her before

959
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
I've never met her before I really know what

960
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,607
My intention was but I do remember I said after you tell me everything you need to say to me I want

961
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,935
How to say some things to you and they said why don't you say what you have

962
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
To say first

963
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
I said I felt like I had been prepared to take care of a kid who had hydrocephalus she said on Gabriel and I arrived at Stanford

964
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,175
There was no one waiting for us there

965
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,319
Had to get checked in the neurosurgeon news on call should have seen Gabriel. Night. Come by

966
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
End

967
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Just more generally

968
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
I trusted you guys I just needed to get in here right like I got him here now somebody else is going to make sure

969
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
Sure everything's okay

970
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,631
And that's not what happened

971
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
This was a critical moment for Stanford

972
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,335
It wasn't usual that time to meet with families after something that happened

973
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:20,735
For obvious reasons I mean if a doctor or a nurse said anything in that meeting that even remotely resembled admitting that they screwed up

974
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,039
That could be used against them in court

975
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,367
And so mostly hospital just avoided these meetings all together

976
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
But

977
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,487
Right around the time that Gabriel died bar Quality Inn

978
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,375
Bridge Department cabin talking to us about taking a different approach and approach that was actually led by Lee Taft

979
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
And the thinking was going to be open

980
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Let's be transparent

981
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
Forget the law

982
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
And so after this

983
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,431
Is like moments after Leilani cerilles off all of her grievances

984
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Pam

985
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
Looks are in the eye

986
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
And says

987
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
We are

988
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Barry

989
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Let me rephrase that

990
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
We are so sorry

991
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,767
This happened in this terrible thing happened

992
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
No family

993
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
Should ever go through

994
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
This kind of loss

995
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
Imperfectly not into Beast

996
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Cancel

997
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
And we we really want

998
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
To be able to help you

999
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,383
And understand what you need from us

1000
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
In order to help you

1001
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Navigate

1002
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Devastating event

1003
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
Were committed

1004
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
2

1005
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Not only

1006
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
Answering your questions

1007
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
We are

1008
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,071
Only investigating what happened and

1009
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
Want to make sure

1010
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
That

1011
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,703
We can put some things in place so that this

1012
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,519
Never happens to another child or family

1013
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
And they went

1014
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
One step further

1015
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,199
The situation that led to

1016
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Gabriel's death

1017
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Was

1018
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
The

1019
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
The

1020
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
Gabriel is on a monitor the alarm skip

1021
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Going off

1022
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
The nurse and the room turned the alarm off

1023
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Not

1024
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
Knowing

1025
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,607
That it turned off all the alarm

1026
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
The nurse in the room that night

1027
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,543
When she went to turn off the alarm next to Gabriel's bed to allow Leilani and Gabriel to sleep

1028
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,383
She also accidentally turned off the alarm on a pager

1029
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
And at the nurses

1030
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Station info

1031
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,039
He wasn't being monitored any really needed to be monitored and subsequently

1032
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,903
Something in our system contributed to this

1033
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
Poor Boys.

1034
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
In other words

1035
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
We made a mistake

1036
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
Stanford had just admitted that

1037
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Finally

1038
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,143
I would have dancing around the issue at all and so with the head just done is

1039
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
Give Leilani evidence

1040
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
Evidence that she could

1041
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
Take the court and use against them

1042
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,847
If you want to do I know she was checking me out I know she was trying to understand

1043
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Whether she could

1044
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Trust me

1045
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,711
There's no question in my mind that that was

1046
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Going through her head

1047
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
And

1048
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
I was doing whatever I could

1049
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
2

1050
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Communicate that

1051
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
Yes you can

1052
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
I'm going to help you

1053
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
I want to help you

1054
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,447
I don't remember a lot of the words

1055
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
But

1056
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,543
I remember how I felt

1057
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
Imagine like you you like you wants to tile

1058
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
And the wrong door apologize

1059
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
Read that can be

1060
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
Almost like a religious

1061
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Moment

1062
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,367
I mean really bad has happened to you in the offender is now in a way like

1063
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
Humbly and vulnerably

1064
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Kneeling before

1065
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
I felt that they listen

1066
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Tumi

1067
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:52,191
And I felt that they genuinely cared about me and my family and about Gabriel

1068
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,983
And I still feel that

1069
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
Leilani accepted their apology

1070
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
She never filed a suit

1071
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,223
I should say that that Stanford did a lot more than just apologized they they reach out to other hospitals had this Monitor and

1072
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Alerted them of the problems or whatever

1073
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Mercante another kid

1074
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,367
I'm in also the relationship between Pam and Leilani like

1075
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
Remain very strong they still are in touch to this day

1076
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,231
And all those things are important but

1077
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
The thing is

1078
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Since Leilani is hot

1079
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Experience

1080
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,655
Stanford and a few other hospitals to do this full disclosure thing

1081
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
What they found

1082
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
Time and time again is that people get an explanation and an apology they are far far less likely to see

1083
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,639
And therefore those Hospital save

1084
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Money

1085
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
A lot of money

1086
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,039
And I guess you know you could think about it and so self-serving way

1087
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,855
If it saves money to apologize

1088
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:47,231
You know what is the motivation behind these apologies and humid in the circuit board room at Stanford somewhere with

1089
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,839
These people in suits making decisions about whether or not they want their doctors and nurses to apologize

1090
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
And the motivation behind that I guess

1091
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,679
It makes you feel a little

1092
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Weird

1093
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
But but when I asked leahlani about this

1094
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
She just said like if money is a driving force

1095
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
I don't care about it at all

1096
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
I don't care

1097
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,223
I don't care about the motivation I would love it

1098
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
I would love it if

1099
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Human connection was the motivation

1100
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
But I know that it's not

1101
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,183
And the fact that this is

1102
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
Makes good business sense

1103
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
If that's what drives people

1104
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,631
I will get on board

1105
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
For me

1106
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,175
I guess what happened between Leilani

1107
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:41,247
And the doctors and the nurses at Stanford Hospital

1108
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,575
I know the cops because I was I was working on this apology piece

1109
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,975
Kipling I had to choose between music Bad apologies I was seeing or no apology.

1110
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Either of those are good

1111
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Or just trying to compare these like super corporate apologies to some sort of moment that the head deep meaning for the

1112
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,959
Two people involved these humans faces

1113
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,567
And I don't know I guess I guess what does Pam and Leilani apology

1114
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
Just felt To Me lyrics

1115
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
This new thing

1116
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,223
New Way Forward

1117
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
It certainly felt that way to Leilani and in fact

1118
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,671
Several years after that meeting she became a Patient Liaison

1119
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Stanford

1120
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,255
Her job is now to sit in that conference room

1121
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,815
And do for others what Pam did

1122
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,191
And the 20th and 21st century you got

1123
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,287
Inhumanity from staring into the abyss

1124
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
Of

1125
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,663
Maybe there is no God and maybe this is all meaningless

1126
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,759
You know there is a kind of searching for what are values

1127
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
Do we have shared values

1128
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
Are there values other than

1129
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,439
The competition for money and resources

1130
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
I'm what

1131
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,255
What do we stand for

1132
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,327
When it comes time to die like what

1133
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,911
What did my life mean what values does it have

1134
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,519
And this is an important like a process that like humanity is going through

1135
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
And

1136
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
It's like we're reaching back to these

1137
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
Traditions of repentance

1138
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
To try to find some shared ground

1139
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:25,183
Like some shared even secular ground and the call to apologize is like no we have to

1140
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
To share these values

1141
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
These are the thing

1142
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,791
That's going to hold us together

1143
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Nice work

1144
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:52,575
I don't know I I don't know it's a good question but

1145
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
Actually I think I

1146
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
Feel like I am beginning to

1147
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,207
You peel back the layers of this

1148
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,767
Incredibly complicated country

1149
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
Speaking of which

1150
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,351
During my reporting actually stumbled

1151
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Upon this

1152
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Very very mad

1153
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Kerrigan

1154
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,543
Little moment in history it's so so apparently during Michael Dukakis run for president

1155
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,943
There's this looks very very negative ad campaign guy who got out of prison and this is one of these

1156
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Worst negative ads

1157
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
Of all-time exit one of the first

1158
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
And it and it I think it ended his campaign

1159
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,927
Right there was a man running for president named George Bush

1160
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,279
Lee Atwater was his campaign manager they put an ad on television

1161
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,887
The television ad said look what's happening in America people are criminals are being released

1162
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:44,543
On furlough and then they're doing terrible things in this case

1163
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,847
Play Don to the Democrat Democrat

1164
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,967
Sorry it was so unfair like they blamed Governor Dukakis

1165
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
For essentially

1166
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Play causing the rape of the

1167
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
This woman

1168
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,391
When he didn't even create the program that allowed the guy to get out of

1169
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
But that was created before him

1170
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
But it was also

1171
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,023
Obviously racist Romanian

1172
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,351
Black guy attacking a white woman and so on so forth

1173
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
I mean speaks for itself

1174
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
So when I was talking to Governor Dukakis the sex

1175
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
She came up that water was a tough guy

1176
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
And he was an attacker

1177
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,175
And he told me that Lee Atwater years later on his deathbed he decided he wanted to

1178
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Repent

1179
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Freddy's

1180
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,551
Sins that he felt he had done in his life and one of those was making

1181
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Willie Horton ad

1182
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,903
Really so we actually apologized what did he say

1183
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Publicly and

1184
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
2 mi

1185
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Campaign manager

1186
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Ready

1187
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Regretted it

1188
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
And what did that mean to you

1189
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
Well I can't tell you that made me feel great cuz

1190
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,727
You know I lost that race

1191
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,543
And a lot of it had to do with at a camp

1192
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
I never

1193
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Having

1194
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,431
I didn't feel any better but looked at least he was wanting to do that

1195
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,759
What does that mean when you say at least he was going to do that

1196
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
Well I think you

1197
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
At least it was one of those

1198
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Knowledge

1199
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,391
Did was racist and he said sewing

1200
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
And apologize for

1201
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
That at least deserve some

1202
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
Some fries but

1203
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
