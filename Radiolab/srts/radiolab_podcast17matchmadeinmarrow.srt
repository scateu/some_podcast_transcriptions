1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,528
Hey I'm Jared Radiolab

4
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
So

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,600
We got an email from you

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
You can head

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
Not long ago our editor and we learned i weekly got into a conversation with this woman

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:39,424
Her name is Janelle Jenny I like the Packers

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,544
I guess photographers would technically be my job but I do a whole lot of different things

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,152
None of which really pertain to the story at hand

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
And our story really starts when Janelle sent an email to the Radiolab inbox basically saying I need your help

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Yeah

13
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
Something that happened to her

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
That was a wondrous

15
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
An unexplainable

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
And very

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Weird

18
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
And as a result Janelle had found herself stuck

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
In

20
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Story

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
A story told a hundreds of thousands of people all across the country a story that's its rights

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,688
Smack dab in the middle of one of the biggest cultural divides in our country right now

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,992
It was a story that wasn't hers

24
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,856
She wanted us to help her find a way to finally tell her story

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Do you want me to kind of just

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Sure well

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
When I was 18

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
I went to a concert

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
A rock concert he has actually is at Warped Tour

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
Looks like a festival of rock concert

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Tons of bands on different stages all over the place

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,248
And Janelle is walking around between all the different stages in merchandising tables when she sees

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
This

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
10 by 10 white tent with just a little cable insurance

35
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,512
Table with a sign on it that says sign up to be on the registry sav-a-life something like that

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
So this was rock music and good deeds

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,424
Ride together especially right was just a pretty good mix in hindsight

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
Soap Janelle read the sign and she thought to herself out sign up

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Why don't ya

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Did you knew what did you know what bone marrow was

41
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Yeah yeah I mean that would mean that they take a really long needle and stick it in you

42
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Second bun stuff I suppose at that point that was probably not the for thoughts and I think the altruist

43
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Thick like do something

44
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
Yeah that was probably the main motivation

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,144
10th was sign some papers in the swapper cheat because

46
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,032
With a bone marrow donation they actually have to figure out if your a genetic match with someone who would receive the donation

47
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Which is part of what Janelle's that was cool about some I always thought that you would just be an amazing opportunity to

48
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Be the one person who could do something

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
For somebody that like literally no one else in the world could

50
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
What's a deep connection with someone that I don't know if either of you are only children by

51
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Yeah it you know how they're just like

52
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400
You have cousins are not friends but at some point there's not that

53
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,008
It sounds so stupid that biological connection like besides my parents are

54
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,312
When I look at you you missed

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
The

56
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Idea of someone who was

57
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Muchly like you and muchly in your world and muchly

58
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
Even the kind of the need like somebody out there dependent on me on kind of that almost other

59
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
The worldly level

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Seokjin L swab your cheek sign the paper and then went about her normal life and then about 6 months

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Later she got a call

62
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,728
Yeah it was a phone call to my landline

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
That's a long-ass

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
So what are you doing here

65
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
Alex knost 2009

66
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Okay

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,016
It was a phone call and I remember very specifically it was a voicemail

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,392
Because I hadn't had the chance to answer it and they said something to the extent of

69
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
Your high from the national bone marrow donor registry

70
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
We've done some tests and we

71
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Nailed you down to be a preliminary match for a patient so we need you to come in and do some further tests that in

72
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
The blood and stuff

73
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Oh no I forgot that I did that or are you thinking oh boy or what were you I was so overcome

74
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
With emotion I remember just just

75
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
To think

76
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,831
There's somebody there's somebody out there that might be my

77
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
Person

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
Awesome absolutely no hesitation am I in

79
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
So

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
Janelle heads in the clinic because well

81
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
Bone marrow the stuff in the core of your bones actually produces all your blood cells and in

82
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,775
Importantly including your white blood cells which are a key part of your immune system

83
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
So you doing

84
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
With a bone marrow transplant is taking a healthy immune system out of one person and putting into another person who is

85
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
System is

86
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
Cancer or messed up in some kind of way he is owed because the immune system is that part of you that

87
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,719
Like recognizes you from not you and attacks anything that's not you

88
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,351
You have to like fool a new body into thinking that this immune system is down

89
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
To the parts of your DNA that have to do with your immune system couple key parts of that have to match with the door

90
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
So that's what they're doing but you know they're taking her into like test your DNA to see if the stuff that marks out her and

91
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
Matches closely enough

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,855
But this you know recipient so that the bone marrow transplant will work

93
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Maybe a months later

94
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
I get another call and this one I was able to answer and they say

95
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Well

96
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
We've done tests and you are the ideal person in this 8 million person registry

97
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
To donate for this patient

98
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311
You are a perfect match

99
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
And

100
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Will you do it

101
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Sounds like

102
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Absolutely

103
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,367
So you like the call of Destiny like a Maybe Maybe This was meant to be

104
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Yeah

105
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
There's something I feel that's like bigger than myself

106
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
It's happening and I don't

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
Really I mean I can't really explain it yet at that point

108
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
But I know there's like

109
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Okay here's if there's a big thing

110
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
So I go in

111
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,359
Unfortunately to disappoint you Robert the way that I donated bone marrow wasn't the actually

112
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
The real

113
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
Bad way with the big needles

114
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Let me come up with a small meat lovers

115
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
You and this is actually the four more common way of doing it now is

116
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Inject you with all these drugs

117
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,607
And it is like eight injections that

118
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Boost your white blood cell count up to astronomical Heights

119
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
And you know like when you get sick when your immune system kicks in overdrive and you feel sick imagine that like 8 time

120
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,223
Friends over every bone hurt

121
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,367
And while Janelle is feeling achy and sick inside of her her bone marrow is pumping out a bunch of new baby

122
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Blood cells

123
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
Unmatured stem cells

124
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
That can really become

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Almost anything

126
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
Let me just go in and grab those cell

127
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Harvest you I guess

128
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,471
Do you have a needle in both arms and you pretty much sat still for 6 hours

129
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Phillies suck all your blood out of your body

130
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Put in a machine and give you back what they don't need

131
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
So I think they've got about

132
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
You're one of those little IV bags

133
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
Just a quart size plastic bag

134
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
My

135
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
And once you're done to put some Band-Aids on your like all right

136
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Let us know if you need anything

137
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
And do you know anything about like what happens to your blood cells like who gets it or what

138
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
Registry is very very strict about

139
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Patient confidentiality but

140
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
They did tell me that it was

141
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,431
A 29 year old man with

142
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

143
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
And that's literally that's all I knew for a whole year

144
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Endless Google searches of

145
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
29 year old man

146
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,863
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

147
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Animated find anything's course

148
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
But once that year is up if both parties agree

149
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Then we can talk

150
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
And that's that's kind of really interesting because

151
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
I definitely was looking forward to that your mark but once that hit

152
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
I kind of got

153
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Cold feet

154
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
A really

155
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Just

156
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Wasn't ready

157
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
To know exactly who he was and then I was also worried that maybe this guy is like a real

158
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Piece of crap like maybe he's a

159
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,423
Clan member criminal or something so there's a part of that too

160
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,055
Open up the Sentinel formerly ill person robs three banks in hits old lady

161
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,687
Yes man saved by Janelle James it's so stupid

162
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
I thought that

163
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,295
So I did end up eventually sending

164
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
This email and whatnot in

165
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
I think about October

166
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
They took them a couple weeks

167
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
To actually give

168
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
Mindful to my patient and vice versa

169
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
I was eating lunch with a friend of mine

170
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
And I remember having chips and guacamole

171
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
By the way my medications name is Jim

172
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
So they gave

173
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,615
Jim my info off my pocket there was an email in my inbox

174
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
End

175
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
There was a

176
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
Scan PDF attached to this email to open it up and

177
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Xi'an

178
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Fill this out with their own hand

179
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
And I just broke

180

191
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
I was like okay I don't know anybody in Texas and then

192
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063

00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831

00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
This is the guy this is him I can see his picture I can look in

195
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
What does he look like

196
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Not very much like me

197
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Yeah

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
Tall for a blunder hair

199
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,663
It's time right now but I've liked strawberry blonde hair blonde hair blue-eyed white guy

200
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
I'm very handsome

201
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
What are you by the short blonde hair

202
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,879
You lied so I guess

203
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
Yeah if we could be cousins I think

204
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
And guess what I look at all these pictures it's

205
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
His wife was a model and these

206
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,863
Kids are so adorable and try to find as much as I can

207
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
As far as his

208
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,751
Profession I was like oh he appears to be some sort of magician

209
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
So I guess we'll talk about that later

210
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
So

211
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
I don't even know like I guess

212
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,039
Why don't we just plan on like where you're from where you were raised

213
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Showcase to that way

214
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
So I was

215
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Born in Orange County California

216
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,047
Fullerton California I went to school in Anaheim High School in Anaheim was a baseball player

217
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
So I ended up going I was very very good baseball player I got drafted by the at the time they're called

218
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays now they're just the Tampa Bay Rays OU would that good

219
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,895
Yeah. Turn down a professional baseball contract to go play at the University of Texas in Austin

220
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
What did you play

221
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
I was a picture

222
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Cuz I was a hard-throwing

223
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Right-hander

224
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
And ended up getting

225
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,183
Like I said drafted and went to the University of Texas to play baseball that's what I thought was going to be at those going to be professional baseball player

226
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
My my sophomore year college I blew out my shoulder I had a surgery my freshman year and then came back and was throwing harder

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Remember then did it again

228
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
So baseball was kind of over

229
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
Uber like 19 like that's

230
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,871
Noticer yeah it was a pretty it was a big Kick In The Head

231
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
But he finished up school that maintain my scholarship as a medical Redshirt majored in business and psychology

232
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,391
Then moved at the Boulder Colorado a got married and had a couple kids

233
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
One of my really good friends during this time was his name was Tennyson and became my best friend's he was he

234
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
It was just my best friend is like my brother he was nasty too so he's a former college football player

235
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
And peed also lost his football career based on injury

236
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
And then also knew Magic

237
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
An illusion

238
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,711
And Magic was actually something that Jim had been fascinated by ever since he was a kid

239
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah I saw trade show magician when I was

240
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,903
1011 it was at the Anaheim Convention Center of all places in an Optometric convention with my parents are, Tristan

241
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Things to do in trade show stuff at a booth

242
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Do you know what he was doing

243
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
He did a version of this

244
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
Call cards across he made a cigarette. She pulled out of your head or out of somebody

245
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,799
Casually holding his hand and was holding a zigzag in the tips of his fingers and he goes delighted

246
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
The puff of smoke and there's a there's a real cigarette

247
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
I thought you had at that moment was

248
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
I want to do that

249
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,807
It was how did he do that and that is cool and

250
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
You know I'm going to go learn how that's done so I just begin to

251
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,767
Look at card tricks and read books on all hell all the stuff was done to figure out how it's done

252
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,863
So when you met Tennyson you know they started practicing together in and doing shows

253
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
In front of friends and family

254
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,727
And pretty soon enough we start doing gigs

255
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,383
They started doing these shows at like schools and festivals and stuff and they would do these tricks

256
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Like a lot of

257
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Card tricks

258
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Number tricks to say

259
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
Pick a random number and it went end up it was written on a piece of paper in the shoe of Nadia's number

260
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Something like that

261
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
But then

262
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
The show would turn into something else

263
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Because

264
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
The thing is

265
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Tennyson

266
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Believer

267
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Overwhelmingly so

268
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
Believer like in God

269
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Yeah Christian

270
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Tennyson was

271
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Very

272
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Commenced

273
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,055
Until after an hour or so of magic tricks

274
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Just pure entertainment Tennyson would say to the crowd

275
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
This is been great we're going to take a quick break

276
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
I'm going to give you guys a chance to take off

277
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,599
Cuz during the second part of the show we're going to talk about what the Christian perspective is and why we believe

278
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Christian thing

279
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
If you want to stick around great if you don't take off

280
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,327
No gym says during this part of the show missing and particularly was way more of the Evangelistic piece of this

281
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
And

282
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
I consider myself more of a producer

283
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Now Jim actually grown up going to church

284
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
Yes I was my parents went to Lutheran Church I was

285
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
That was my doing that

286
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Pittsburgh Steelers

287
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Yeah you know

288
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
At the end of the day it's just there was nothing in it

289
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
That's up

290
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Seem to be

291
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Satisfying

292
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
So at this point in the show Jim Wood

293
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Stand back

294
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
As Tennyson talked about how

295
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Magic is actually all about the eye

296
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
Seeing behind the veil of reality there's

297
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
God

298
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Watching over us

299
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
And Jim said he would

300
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Standing there on stage

301
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Watching these people in the audience

302
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
We're feeling this real connection with God

303
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
However I wasn't having that experience

304
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,967
Like I don't feel what they're feeling and he started singing to himself I didn't want to be the guy that's a while I'm a Christian because my

305
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
My friends were or

306
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm a Christian cuz I was raised that way

307
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
I want it to be true

308
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
He just wasn't sure that it was

309
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Right

310
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,463
And after he in Tennyson and been doing this show for

311
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
Year-and-a-half or so

312
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Jim got a call

313
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Anderson had been out hiking in the mountains

314
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,935
Just outside of Boulder and he was found

315
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
In a river

316
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
His body was

317
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Partially submerged

318
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Just at the edge of the water

319
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
At the base of a 40-foot cliff

320
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Peaceful Valley

321
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Is always calling

322
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
No one really knows how he passed

323
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Looks like you might have actually fallen from the cliff

324
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
The police.

325
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Maybe suicide but it could be

326
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
You know exposure to the elements

327
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
I kind of thing

328
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Yeah Jim says he was just

329
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,423
Devastated now he's probably the closest male friend I've ever had just felt like he was

330
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
In the bottom of a hole

331
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Yeah

332
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Bottom of a hole

333
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Figuring it out

334
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,895
Best friend passes away my wife and I as a result

335
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,247
I kind of got into this really strange season where are you know I'm depressed she's depressed

336
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Pretty much on the verge of

337
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
Calling it Quits and then my leg starts hurting

338
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Really badly

339
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Where in the leg

340
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Underneath my right knee

341
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
Jim says he started popping Advil everyday

342
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
And more and more

343
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
And I'm trying to get it out

344
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:16,031
Then he came home one day and he says it's the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of his car and so his wife was like look

345
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
We're going to the hospital now

346
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm sitting there and in an emergency room in this man walks into my room he looks me says

347
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
You have cancer

348
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
Jim had leukemia which is on cancer of the blood cells to the white blood cells inside of your bone marrow have literally

349
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,487
Exploded out of control and the reason why your leg hurts so bad is cuz your your bone is breaking on its own

350
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
From the inside

351
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,607
Wow and he said that if you don't do anything you're going to die in 2 months

352
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
Just before Christmas of 2008

353
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Jim checks into the hospital

354
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
Right away they do two things

355
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
When they put gym on the bone marrow registry in the hopes that he can find a donor

356
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
To just to keep him alive while he waits

357
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
They start putting him through round after round

358
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,855
Chemo and get this wicked concoction of stuff and then be let out loses his hair

359
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
His body starts

360
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Fall Apart

361
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
And all you can do at that point is just

362
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Hope

363
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Like tick

364
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Coptic

365
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Tik Tok Tik Tok yum

366
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,055
That's when you think you know what you believed to be true

367
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
How is in Kai's University

368
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
That's when you find out so for me it was not

369
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
It was not

370
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
A Christian worldview

371
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
There is an all-loving omnipotent

372
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Powerful being that

373
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Makes the universe go round then why would things like

374
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
You know suicide or

375
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
Murder or rape exist in it and

376
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Goodness constructed world of his

377
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,287
Jim just couldn't get himself to believe in the existence of God like that or

378
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Really any guy

379
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,175
Now it wasn't any Rhyme or Reason or purpose is just this is this is my lot

380
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
This really sucks

381
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
And then when he was

382
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
That is

383
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Lowest point

384
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,463
Remember driving back to Houston Texas from or chemo and my phone rang and I didn't recognize the number and

385
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
I said hello in this woman on the other line

386
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
She said

387
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
There's a one-person

388
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
That we've been able to identify on the planet

389
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
Out of all the databases everything there's one you are

390
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,823
The ideal person in this 8 million person registry

391
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
To donate for this patient

392
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Think about that

393
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
Is in the world you are

394
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
A perfect match

395
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Will you do it

396
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Feels like

397
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Absolutely

398
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,463
My wife and I were in the car together and it was just tears

399
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
You know

400
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Wow

401
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Amazing

402
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
So April

403
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
20th

404
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
And this is

405
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Important to remember

406
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
April 20th was when

407
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
I donated

408
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
And if they're pulling

409
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,687
The cells are Janelle's body up in Wisconsin

410
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Full

411
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
My

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Himself

413
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Denton Texas gyms doctors were telling him

414
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
Your bone marrow transplant is scheduled for April 23rd on April 23rd the nurses they come inside of your room to celebrate your set

415
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Second birth

416
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:24,447
And then I remember Dr draw tell me are you ready to put your boxing gloves on when he was preparing me for was

417
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
A death

418
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Come to find out later on they pulled my wife

419
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,967
Out of my room and it said we're going to give this to end with all this medication

420
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,575
He could potentially receive this and reject this violently and passed away

421
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,951
Just remember they're essentially replacing Jim's immune system with somebody else's in this case Janelle's

422
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
And in a very real way the replacing that part of Jim that determines who he is

423
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
Would someone who he clearly isn't

424
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
And Southern

425
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
A real chance that the body will just

426
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Short Circuit

427
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
So

428
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Forgiveness drug the nurses nickname shake and bake

429
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
Designed to basically wipe out whatever is left

430
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Jem's immune system his white blood cells

431
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
What inside of your RV

432
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,807
Your body just starts convulsing and then they put Janelle sells

433
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
And they monitored me and over the next couple weeks to know cells enter Jim's Body to get into his bone marrow and they start Ford

434
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,096
Reducing new white blood cells producing a whole new immune system

435
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
And eventually

436
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
Jim is cancer free

437
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
I mean it

438
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
It's literally like

439
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
New Life

440
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
You know

441
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Now I will say this

442
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
Some Bells kind of began to go off of my a little bit

443
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
Jim says before he even got the transplant his Doctorate come into his room and told him you're going to be like a baby in

444
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Inside your mother's womb literally being born again

445
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
Because on April 23rd and once again this is their terminology

446
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
Or someone else that's going to be living on the inside of you

447
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
And this new system of blood is going to

448
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Be your life

449
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Why is that interesting

450
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
You know

451
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,360
April 23rd my new birthday is April 23rd my old birthday is April 20th

452
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
I my new birthday is on April 23rd

453
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,504
That's on the third day and on the third day is significant because of the

454
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Google Echo

455
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
A Biblical Echo

456
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Young

457
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
I came back from

458
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
Whatever I was in

459
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,976
Because of the only blood implant that could save me of my disease

460
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
Soto does this land on you the way it sounds to me like it lands on you now

461
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Or did you go through Omegle like what happened

462
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Those words

463
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah those words

464
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,896
I'm particularly Bells went off in my head is that right is that mean that you know

465
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Suddenly

466
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Believe in God

467
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Again or

468
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
The first time

469
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
I mean I

470
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
It's process right you follow

471
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
And then I think

472
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Puzzle pieces are kind of all swirling and coming together

473
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Albert

474
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,536
Everything changed on that demarcating day April 23rd all things

475
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Obviously

476
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Did you know and

477
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,192
Not long after they got each other's information and saw each other on Facebook they hopped on a

478
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
My phone call

479
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
So she gets on and I get on

480
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
But it's all kind of like

481
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
Hey oh my gosh is crazy I cannot believe this is nuts yeah this is so crazy in

482
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
And then she drops this on me

483
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
She said I went and got a tattoo

484
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Of a jigsaw puzzle piece

485
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,464
On the very spot where they stuck that IV in my arm to pull out the new blood knowing

486
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,816
I was the missing piece in someone else's life and without me that person wouldn't be alive

487
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
And I said you I was like what I was attempting to have a ton of tattoos

488
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
She said no I have one

489
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Did you know what Christians believe to be true right

490
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
Is it their savior rolled-up

491
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
And show them the very spot on his body

492
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Where blood came out

493
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
So that they would believe

494
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,696
So you're just going down this I really your you just you're driving like at a hundred miles an hour.

495
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
This

496
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
For me it was like I was being introduced to a person

497
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
There is an experiential understanding

498
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Of

499
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
That which was going on behind the scenes of this existence that was

500
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Answer my prayer

501
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
The prayers for is the pair is called are you there

502
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Yep. Are you there God

503
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,392
Basically Jim sajan on her donation to him as almost

504
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
More than just allegory is like something close to a literal proof of the existence of God like a very real very

505
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Present

506
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
I told her to

507
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
I told her that we need to meet I said can I please bring out the Dallas Texas said I have to bring you to Texas

508
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
Which is my nightmare

509
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,712
But absolutely I thought I wanted to go right into it

510
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Super excited so guess I flew her

511
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
To Dallas Texas I actually recorded it

512
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,792
Let's go save my life

513
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
In the video you see gym sort of

514
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
Standing at the bottom of the escalator in

515
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
Dallas-Fort Worth

516
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,520
Airport he's looking pretty thin and pale and

517
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Nervous

518
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
The camera turns

519
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,176
There's Janelle

520
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
Coming down the escalator

521
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
Andy hug

522
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,536
Names kids come up

523
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
And eventually his wife

524
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,520
Okay so so so now you go home

525
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Wright & Phillips

526
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
In a very big house

527
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Outside of Dallas

528
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
They had dinner with the family and then you know once everybody else

529
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
What kind of heading off to bed

530
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
Jim and Janelle StarTalk

531
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
And.

532
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,392
I think if I remember correctly we

533
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
The just outside by the pool and

534
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Stalking

535
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Figuring out

536
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Who each other was

537
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
Feels like so you know magician

538
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
What is that Intel

539
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,032
He started telling me about what kind of magician he really is and he is

540
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
A

541

Christian

542
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Magician

543
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
Oh my gosh I just saved a Christian magician from Texas

544
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
This is life

545
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,184
Jokes on me and that wonderful you know

546
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,536
When we come back Janelle becomes Jim's

547
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
Greatest magic trick so don't go away

548
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,992

551
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,096
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

552
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:21,216
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

553
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
And I request

554
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

555
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
About what we're calling

556
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,320
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something

557
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

558
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

559
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
To you

560
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

561
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in

562
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with it

563
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
If you have a story please share it with us

564
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392

Thank you so much

568
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
Okay we're back I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab let's return to

569
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
Wheeler sister and you left us in the backyard they're about to talk right

570
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,696
Yep sitting in Jim's backyard by the pool and he's basically telling her his whole story about

571
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Is Joe diblasi

572
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,792
Faith and the cancer and how she saved his life

573
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,864
And then he tells her that right after she saved him

574
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,168
He started doing the magic show again

575
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
That show that I used to do with tennis in the show is called the maze

576
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
This is the maze

577
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,784
So we actually got to see Jim show and I have to say

578
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
He's a pro it's

579
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,648
It's an impressive production he gets big venues

580
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,024
Usually thousand people are so there's crazy laser light show stuff

581
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,328
And he does he's really

582
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
Complicated illusions that are sort of Half Penny teller have David Blaine

583
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:35,872
Simple picking a random phone number out of the phone book ends up being someone in the audience

584
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,200
And then they're going to end up like hidden somewhere like that

585
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
And

586
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Very good

587
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
So Jim is telling Janelle about all these tricks

588
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,624
But then he says second half of the show

589
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Is about

590
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
Explains the magic show at this point ends

591
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Tell people they can leave if they want to

592
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
He start to talk

593
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Openly

594
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
Especially to the audience

595
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,240
Where I quickly found out that I had

596
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
Answer

597
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
In Barrie

598
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Personal terms about what

599
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Happened to him

600
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,248
Raced down to MD Anderson Cancer Center

601
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
Good afternoon

602
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Open the kimono strategy Cannon

603
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
He's in the hospital

604
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
My maths

605
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Throwing up into a bucket

606
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
And he's

607
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
10

608
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Huge circles under his eyes

609
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
And then

610
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
He's playing

611
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
Right when he was on

612
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
The edge of death at his lowest point this

613
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
This thing happened

614
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
A miracle happen

615
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
1

616
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
One person

617
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Just

618
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
When his

619
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Blood was literally poisoning his own body

620
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,008
Somebody substituted there blood on his behalf

621
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
So he could be

622
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Reborn again

623
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,200
Three days after his birthday

624
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
The only Global Atlantic Infinity Lite

625
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,648
So there's a whole three days thing there which is the story of Easter in the rebirth it says

626
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
In cases such as

627
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Like definitive proof that there's a God

628
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Either either

629
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Vista tistical number that continues to propagate this false ideology of Supernatural

630
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,896
I like being bitten by shark and struck by lightning at the same time

631
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,968
Or you might have to believe what I believe is true

632
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,528
But that is the result of the girl in the final scene

633
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,232
So yes this is all

634
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,024
Being thrown at me

635
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
And is he

636
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Is he saying all this

637
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
To you by the pool

638
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,448
Is it all it all comes tumbling out

639
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
How are you

640
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
How are you

641
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Feeling

642
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Inside

643
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Stranger and stranger

644
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,176
Going down the Wormhole because

645
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
I am

646
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
An atheist

647
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
In the sense that

648
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
I don't

649
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
I don't believe

650
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,928
In the tenets of Christianity I don't believe really in the tenants of any

651
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
Established religion I've ever seen

652
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
Honestly I just think that once things

653
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,424
Are labeled in your pigeon-holed and the exclusivity of really any religion is

654
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
Is the cause for a lot of problems

655
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
It's world history

656
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
But

657
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,944
Face can be beautiful and there's definitely parts of me and there's moments in my life that

658
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,064
Boy praying and really feeling like that was going out to somebody would feel great

659
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
But I just

660
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Can't

661
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
They just can't do it

662
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
So

663
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
At that moment and he's telling me this

664
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
And

665
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
Yeah and he's like well

666
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
You know you're here in Texas for this weekend

667
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
And would you be willing

668
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
To come on stage for one of my shows

669
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
So I can introduce you

670
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
And

671
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
Of course I said yes

672
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Really

673
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Of course he said yes

674
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Chris

675
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,600
I've always kind of looked at our story as

676
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Something bigger

677
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
Then what he believes and what I don't believe it's

678
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
Diggers capital B underline bold

679
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
It's big

680
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,704
Partly because Jim and every show he has the bone marrow registry people right there

681
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
Ready to sign for

682
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Because

683
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Of the show they just

684
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Saw

685
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
You can get a hundred

686
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,968
I know that dozens of people have gone on to be matches

687
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
So

688
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
This was truly the combination of

689
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
From

690
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,160
The moment I signed up to be on that registry this

691
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
Felt like the Zenith of this entire thing

692
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
So last night at Texas Christian University

693
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Packed house

694
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
Chanel's in the audience I was in like the front row during the second part of the show when Jim goes through the rebirth

695
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
He stops and he says

696
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
That's what everyone

697
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
A person who saved my life

698
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
She's here

699
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
He has me walk up on stage

700
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Crowd went wild the first time in my life I got a standing ovation

701
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
Haitian

702
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,560
Because you're Jesus that's why the Catholic crazy is because

703
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Yeah

704
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,984
All of these kids in the audience who are all pretty much my age as well

705
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Arsene

706
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
My being on stage as

707
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Quite possibly the

708
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
Biggest proof they've ever had

709
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
There is

710
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh God

711
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
Will you will you now

712
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,928
Wheat was there any part of you that still I shouldn't be here or you all there

713
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
There was

714
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
A part of me that felt

715
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,608
A little bit of an imposter

716
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,192
But for now she says that feeling was outweighed

717
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
Just by the number of people that were lining up

718
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
The bone marrow

719
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Donation table

720
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
So the next time she had a chance

721
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
She did it again

722
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,808
And again

723
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,720
She's now appeared at the end of the show around a dozen times

724
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
All around the country

725
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Playing the role of gems

726
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Personal

727
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Savior

728
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,680
And she says the more time she did it the more that feeling that

729
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Fraud feeling kept

730
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Popping up

731
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Each time a little bit louder

732
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Yeah

733
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,384
There's parts of me there's Little Fibers in my being that are like

734
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
While if

735
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,480
If this is a sign if there is a God

736
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
I'm a real jerk

737
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
This is such

738
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,392
A beautiful and really literal

739
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976
Story being told me about like hay

740
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
You know maybe there is a God

741
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
Said she started to feel that like if she's both

742
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
Apache wedding vows

743
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
Story and misusing it

744
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,192
There's a special place in hell for me

745
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
And this is

746
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
Why Janelle got in touch with us

747
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,616
Because she wanted us to help her figure out a way to tell a story

748
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Gitlab

749
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
Her way of seeing the world

750
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Into the room

751
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Okay are you guys

752
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Is everyone there

753
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
I'm here I can hear you guys dinner can hear me

754
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
I can

755
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
How are you

756
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
So I'm pretty sure let's have Nassar actually started talking to Janelle about what exactly she wanted to do and they decided that we

757
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:56,192
You just all get in the studio gym and her and all of us and see if we could

758
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,056
Okay I just like Janelle do you want to just kind of talk through what

759
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
What we've been thinking

760
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
Oh sure I can try if you want to

761
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Help me lots of sir

762
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
Essentially

763
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,552
Lots of eye and I have been talking about

764
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
What would be the best way for me to kind of tell

765
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
My side of the story

766
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,256
Yeah my side of our story so to speak without

767
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
So much of the religious stuff

768
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Yes so when are you guys going to do that

769
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,032
Maybe I missed the point I'm sorry

770
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,616
So do you say we as in like we are going to do a version of that

771
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Flashlight

772
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Help me

773
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
Oh cool well

774
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
I have no problem

775
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:47,392
Yeah cuz you are so not only a magician with magic things but also with words

776
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Haha

777
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
So

778
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Maybe if we could

779
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
If you could help me

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,352
Yeah totally that's that's so interesting my mind begins to spin

781
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
And I have it so at first we suggested maybe Janelle come out at the end of one of Jim shows and just read a statement or something and Jim said

782
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,848
That's probably not going to work as you guys know in this world

783
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,688
Mean audiences come based upon how things are marketed and booked and

784
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
Jim said you know he has to worry about

785
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
Turn up as a business the expectations of a

786
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
Sponsors and an even the audience were

787
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,904
We're looking for a certain thing

788
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Producer cuz I'm

789
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
So we're like okay fair enough maybe we could be like a

790
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Q&A

791
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
After the show

792
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,888
I have to really process it but I'm totally open to it

793
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
I would always love to help

794
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
Janelle figured I mean help her

795
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
Put it all together in like I think

796
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,968
So eventually we landed on a plan gym was going to be doing his show up in St Cloud Minnesota

797
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
I and we decided Well we could just

798
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,088
Do a show with him and Janelle the next night

799
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:56,256
So long with preachers LiftMaster in enemy we headed up to steam Cloud met up with Jenelle and that night we went

800
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Did you all go see gems show

801
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Olympic venue there's probably like

802
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Thousand people there all college students

803
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:08,032
Intercourse because Janelle was there right after you did the sort of personal Journey back to God

804
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Check this out

805
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:19,552
She's here tonight a little bit hard to hear but there was literally like

806
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
Shutter of energy that went through the crowd at that moment

807
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,128
So yeah like I said

808
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:52,576
Better speaker than you encourage all of you to

809
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Consider

810
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
So Janelle just pointed out that the national bone marrow registry would be there that night and she encouraged everybody to know

811
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
Sign up and have a chance to

812
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,584
To Save a Life and do something good

813
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,168
Considerate

814
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,800
Oh yeah Jim Heather show the whole audience for puzzle piece tattoo

815
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Only one

816
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
And wants to know it step back off the stage

817
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,184
Before we close I wanted to know if I can pray for you

818
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
You guys still pray in Minnesota right down here lyrics

819
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,056
Lord Jesus

820
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Tonight

821
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Hi chews

822
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Turn

823
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,992
It's not letting myself my own version of My Own Story

824
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
I want to trust you

825
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
I don't have all the answers but I know you do it tonight by faith I choose to follow you

826
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
Thank you for loving me text you in a bit

827
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Provincialism

828
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
I love you too

829
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
In Jesus mighty name amen and amen

830
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,480
And then just before everybody stepped out

831
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,528
This is very important

832
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm going to be here another night I'm going to be at work tomorrow night

833
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,488
Play the podcast Radiolab

834
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,376
Has about three people that shout it out

835
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
Nobody cares

836
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
Radiolab is going to be holding

837
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,056
This side of the story

838
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
What happened to her

839
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
All right

840
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:59,295
So after the show we actually got a chance to talk to some of the people from the audience

841
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
The whole three days

842
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,743
Oh my God I can't believe that she was actually here

843
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,327
Here in there I would have been so shocked to sit right next to her

844
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:16,191
Pretty much everybody was totally floored by actually getting to see Janelle in person and they all seem to

845
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,799
Take her story The Way Jim does

846
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Today's weather

847
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
So many things fell in mine were

848
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
You just have to believe in my

849
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
So the next night

850
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
My name is Mark Springs much less Fanfare in a much smaller room like maybe a hundred people there is so with the help of the

851
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,351
The religious studies program at st. Cloud University

852
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
We did Janelle sting

853
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,287
I saw I'm Robert College I am one of the co-hosts of the public radio program called Radiolab

854
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,615
I want you to salser and Wheeler who's our managing editor

855
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Who's going to

856
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
That's him he's going to be adding his two cents from time somewhere very Democratic show in like nobody controls everything and everybody pitches in so that's our hero

857
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Go to

858
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
And I want to begin by

859
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Just telling you a store

860
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
So we brought Janelle up on stage

861
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,047
But you're not going to just come up here and sit I guess might as well sit here we told her whole story of

862
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
Donating and then waiting a year to find out you know who Jim really was

863
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
No idea

864
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:27,615
Talk about you know his whole processor

865
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Recovery

866
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,503
Trying to get your bearings you talk about how grateful and thankful he was and then return back to Janelle

867
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,855
A little more complicated could you just run

868
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
I asked you like how you felt

869
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Inn at 4

870
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
Brown and usually told me in the interview

871
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
There was

872
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
A part of me that felt

873
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
A little bit of an imposter

874
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,775
When would you use the word imposter

875
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
Can we should start getting in

876
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
I think so

877
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
Part of me

878
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
I'm in at that time

879
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Especially

880
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
Thought that

881
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
I'm up here

882
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Again

883
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Asda

884
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,351
Pretty hard and fast proof or very compelling

885
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Narrative for a lot of

886
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
People and their faith

887
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
That I don't

888
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
Particularly Cher

889
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
At all

890
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
The question

891
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
Knowing that

892
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
You know what I thought

893
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:42,367
Why was I was very concerned knowing that you

894
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
You know

895
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,975
Didn't agree with what I believe to be true that that you would feel like

896
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Secure in that spot

897
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
That's why I asked you

898
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Yeah

899
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
I'm a good person, doesn't make anything different in the fact that

900
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
It's still what it is

901
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Exactly

902
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
I would have done it

903
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Regardless

904
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Whatever it was

905
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,943
If your whole theme of your show with Halle Berry

906
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,039
The Dallas Cowboys were and it got everybody to join the bone marrow registry

907
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,695
I would have got a boys have a show

908
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
Even though I don't have

909
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
You know what I hear to the

910
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,839
The religious tenets of it

911
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,167
I still get that feeling and everybody

912
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,567
All my family all my friends whatever their religious even my Muslim friends that I've told the story get

913
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Do you know that feeling

914
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
And you know what that feeling

915
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Is

916
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
Is a little intangible

917
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,087
But I think it's something even a little

918
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Bigger than

919
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
I'm so crappy to see

920
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
Bigger than Jesus

921
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,911
That's really Blasphemous but I can't think of a better way to say it

922
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Well you know

923
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
That

924
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,871
There is good in this universe and there is

925
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,175
Good and everybody and it is

926
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
Regardless of

927
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
The goodness is at the top of

928
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,111
The list of you and everything else is follow us here

929
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,463
Religion and your race and where you're born and it's your favorite pizza topping

930
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Thanks and all that

931
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
But at the very top

932
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Is

933
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Good

934
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
With a capital G in underline

935
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
All right

936
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
Jim

937
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:38,335
In your show you have a rather gorgeous take on on moral relative

938
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
You have a string of thoughts

939
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,783
But this idea of being good and doing no harm and living as ethically as you know how

940
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Is

941
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Satisfying to some people

942
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
But in your ovulating

943
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Really enough

944
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
I am this is where we I mean

945
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
Obviously there's some disagreement here

946
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
I think

947
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
That

948
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
There is good and I think that there is evil

949
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,471
In this world

950
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
And

951
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
I think the people in and of Their Own

952
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,663
Left their own vices left to own devices I think that the struggle of being good

953
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,967
I think that even on our best day

954
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,503
I think that we

955
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,439
And so in hearing her account you just say you just saying thinking what that is that she's not

956
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
What if what if we're does she falls to where does this idea

957
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Lose you

958
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
I don't mean it doesn't lose me I think it's

959
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
Phenomenally good it's

960
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,239
Not not acknowledging his good I just think that

961
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
For it for the Christian

962
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
It's not about being good or bad

963
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
What is it about

964
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,407
I think it's about

965
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
I think it's about having a relationship with God

966
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,111
You know he made it clear that

967
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Definitely

968
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
Wasn't condemning Janelle

969
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Didn't have a relay

970
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
God

971
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
But then we

972
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,095
Start a different approach she started talking about the unlikeliness

973
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
This whole

974
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,679
Story which is why the things that Jim talks about in the show

975
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
Until that point I decided I should jump in

976
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
I say this

977
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Really say this only

978
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,663
I'm because it is our job as a show on that when we hear a story like this

979
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,991
We dig and we investigate and we do that from a frame

980
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
Been really focused on math

981
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,391
Facts science and couple things happen to you if you happen to be in my position

982
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,463
You run across stuff like this and I'll just read from the

983
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Be a match

984
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
Website

985
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,607
A patient's likelihood of finding a match and donor on be the match Reddit

986
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,679
Is estimated to be between 66 and 97

987
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
Percent chance that you'll find a 10 to 10 match

988
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
In the way that

989
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Jim and Janelle work anime

990
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
10 matches

991
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
Is around 50%

992
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
Good Witch

993
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
She was the one that let me say that this does not actually contradict with Jim and Janelle's experience of it for

994
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
For that to happen to Jim

995
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Is truly staggering it is truly

996
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,815
It could be one in a trillion you know like

997
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
The way winning a lottery is one in a trillion

998
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,495
One in the can because what happens is if you backup away from the individual and ask not

999
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,591
What are the chances this would happen the gym but what are the chances that this would happen to someone

1000
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Somewhere

1001
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,687
It's like there's a there's a story about if you're golfing and you hit a golf ball

1002
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,527
Nicholas however many hundreds of yards

1003
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
That lands on a blade of grass

1004
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
And a blade of grass is

1005
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Why me

1006
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,743
Why would this golf ball crush me like this

1007
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Which is a valid point

1008
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,375
I would feel that too but that ball was going to land on some

1009
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Way to browse

1010
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
So are you

1011
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
It doesn't like there is the Waimea still a true thing

1012
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
It is a true experience

1013
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
In which

1014
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,407
There's still this difference I think

1015
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,223
The bull can't point to anything greater

1016
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,039
No there's the argument lurks behind this is

1017
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
That these things happen and it is

1018
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:08,511
Places to random View

1019
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
The ball of Mercy landed on you

1020
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:19,519
I also not coming at it from just that angle and I wonder if it was just

1021
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
The bone marrow transplant if it would be

1022
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,615
People get that all the time I think

1023
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,759
Press the other bits and pieces of the puzzle maybe help Shadow it in you know a little bit for me

1024
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,367
And so I don't know what's meets its multi-layered cake

1025
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
I thought you really don't like

1026
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
This idea

1027
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
Like in this science version

1028
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
There is no design and there is no first cause except the first random event that sets the thing in motion

1029
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Right

1030
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,983
You both

1031
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,799
Could you either of you live with that version of what

1032
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:58,431
Yeah well that's perfect cuz it's exactly what you're talk about in your show

1033
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
With

1034
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:07,903
Nails referring to a thing in gem show where he talks about how unlikely any particular order of cards in a deck is

1035
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
And idea of a particular set of cards being

1036
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,071
Dealt in a particular way is 52 factorial

1037
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,655
It is impossible to possible number you couldn't

1038
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
Statistically right right

1039
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,263
But yet you deal the cards and they happen

1040
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Right there so

1041
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,383
This really gets into just the different viewpoints on

1042
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
The proverbial deck of cards

1043
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Who is stealing them

1044
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
Is it in a particular fashion and I think that's

1045
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
And what Jim believes that there is a

1046
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
Proverbial dealer

1047
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
And I don't

1048
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
And you would be.

1049
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Yah mean

1050
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,935
Haven't you given thought to that

1051
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
I believe

1052
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,799
Did that there was some sort of

1053
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,615
You know mind personality

1054
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,015
So I believe part is where you is where you stand but it is absolutely absolutely it is

1055
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
And you know

1056
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Your

1057
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Is

1058
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,415
Savior I guess who saved his life

1059
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
But in some way

1060
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
You don't

1061
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,023
You haven't

1062
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
You worried about this at all

1063
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Yeah absolutely

1064
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Uneven

1065
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
Right now on this stage there's a part of me that

1066
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
In front of all of you

1067
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,311
That I'm sure lot of here at the show last night

1068
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
There's a part of me that is

1069
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Afraid of disappointing

1070
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
That I don't share

1071
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
What you believe to be true I mean

1072
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Your entire

1073
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,391
Experience pretty much points the arrow

1074
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
That like

1075
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
I'm like an alliteration of Jesus

1076
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
And that's really difficult

1077
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
Reconcile

1078
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Doesn't have faith

1079
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
A sad song

1080
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
Cuz I think it's

1081
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,447
It would be alot easier if I just believe

1082
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Exactly what

1083
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
And I think

1084
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
That I

1085
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Always

1086
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
I'm very afraid of letting that

1087
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
Be known like

1088
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
Super

1089
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,247
Like clammy right now just saying it in front of this many people

1090
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
I just feel like people would

1091
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
See

1092
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
Your story and it's so

1093
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Immensely

1094
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
Compelling it's unbelievable

1095
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
And then see that that

1096
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
Last piece

1097
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Photo puzzle

1098
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
Literally doesn't fit

1099
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
At all

1100
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
I mean it's not like I haven't

1101
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:33,311
I haven't thought about that either and how you might feel and

1102
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,127
I empathize and I don't know how to add

1103
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
I just I just want to give you a hug

1104
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,575
There's a unconditionality to how I feel about you that

1105
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
I just

1106
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,767
If you can do no wrong in my eyes for you the hardest thing I was just trying to

1107
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
You have been saved your life has been saved by her

1108
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,679
She is in affect your savior

1109
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
And yet you are believe

1110
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
Is the unless she except

1111
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
Jesus the consumption

1112
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
She's outside of Grace

1113
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,919
And you know I don't know I don't know what happened but

1114
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:15,551
But she might be punished what do you do about this weird and she's insisting nope not for me

1115
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,855
This is the way it is

1116
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
Oh my gosh

1117
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,487
What is it hard for you no not at all

1118
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Because

1119
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
It's not my place to do that

1120
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,631
I'm very sorry to everyone who isn't

1121
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,447
Whoever feels like they got judged by Christian

1122
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
Cuz it's never their place to do that

1123
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
And this is where

1124
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,847
I think most of the time never listen this podcast is

1125
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Place

1126
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
Positioned or pigeonholed Christian

1127
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
And

1128
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,503
What they don't understand is that

1129
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,551
I'm not commanded

1130
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
To do anything

1131
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
But to love

1132
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
And to start conversations

1133
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,767
I'm not the one I'm not I'm not that I'm not the one who sent it

1134
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Into the world

1135
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
The judge

1136
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Right

1137
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
But what I sow

1138
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
So

1139
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
Putting it like that I know where you are know where you want to go with

1140
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
Judge that may not love the woman who saved your life

1141
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
Yes but

1142
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,455
But at the same time

1143
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
That's not what I'm

1144
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
The temperature in my place

1145
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
How to say I think we were

1146
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,695
Sort of expecting that maybe there will be

1147
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,511
Sharper Edge the differences

1148
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
Between Jim and Janelle

1149
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
But to be honest

1150
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Their conversation that night and

1151
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
Story started to feel like

1152
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,471
Almost an allegory

1153
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,287
How to move through the world and

1154
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,847
Hold your differences but still be one

1155
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,199
Let me just finish this way do you have a sense between the two of you

1156
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:51,039
I'm because obviously you if you stay very very good for

1157
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
Laptop

1158
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,159
Is there some something to eat either of you can say

1159
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,231
That explains why you can

1160
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:05,375
Dignifiedly but emphatically disagree and still stay in such extraordinary

1161
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
Close

1162
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Touch

1163
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
I think

1164
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
The idea of

1165
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,847
Humility and as Gimli even say grace

1166
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,127
Is

1167
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,735
Absolutely essential no matter your tenants of belief

1168
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
And that's really what's going to get you

1169
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
Brutal conflict

1170
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
So

1171
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Yeah

1172
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,183
Is it because you're in

1173
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,255
They speak ocean of the world and the two of you were just little

1174
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,559
Little dots in it and so

1175
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:39,167
Whatever you think it's till you're in the big ocean and they watch you got there

1176
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
I think maybe yeah

1177
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
And

1178
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,055
Do you feel

1179
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
Do I feel small

1180
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
I feel tiny

1181
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
Humility

1182
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
Root word

1183
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
It comes from

1184
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
The rudest

1185
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Hummus

1186
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Is dirt

1187
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
So when you become humble you become

1188
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
Creates things but I won't go there

1189
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
But you become dirt and

1190
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,287
I think I think where we get hung up

1191
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
Is

1192
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
That

1193
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
We want to be right

1194
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,943
It has been brought into the

1195
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
This yet

1196
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
You want to be right

1197
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,039
And right and wrong

1198
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
AR

1199
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
The words right and wrong

1200
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,975
Are are are dead I think in relationship or deadly words I think that saying I'm right you're wrong

1201
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,815
Is this is this is not good for relationships

1202
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,887
I think it's like that's fine that's fine

1203
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,935
You're right or you're wrong to her

1204
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
I think so

1205
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,479
I think we're done now. This we were done done that means that I'm going to let these

1206
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
Two people

1207
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
Who's the person

1208
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
Brought them together

1209
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,487
At the end of the show we had the

1210
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:12,863
Bone marrow registry people there and encourage people sign up in quite a few did I think maybe

1211
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
20 or so

1212
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
But

1213
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:22,335
That was pretty much nothing compared to what gym got at the end of his show

1214
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:26,175
150 people signing up right now that account them

1215
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,991
Better producer Annie McEwen

1216
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,807

1217
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
Always like this

1218
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,439
This is a little bigger than normal I think anytime but I'm actually in the shows

1219
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,231
Love it better so I've Been Told

1220
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:43,327
And what is it how you feeling when you watch this

1221
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
It's really overwhelming like

1222
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,751
Yeah kind of makes me want to cry

1223
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
Me Without You this wouldn't happen

1224
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
