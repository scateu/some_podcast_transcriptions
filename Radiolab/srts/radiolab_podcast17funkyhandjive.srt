1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Can I tell you a story

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
I don't have a choice do I have

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
Jack Kennedy John F Kennedy was the president

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Penny Annie's

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
Very good

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
You really use on television was fun to watch and he would he would he would go to mass in my neighborhood in New York when you come

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Anthony York

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
Kygo

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Do a particular Church all the time and just out of enthusiasm some of my friends and I would go and stand there and watch him just walk up the staff so you can

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
Can you see the president

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
Of the United States in

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,224
Wife has multiple too many times yes

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Because he we were big fans

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
And then

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
One day

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,832
We went to do that

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
And I can't remember whether he's Zip by or zipped in but anyway we missed it

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,976
I and my friend John.

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,096
But he was a New York ID so he thought they would be interested he knew that the place where presently was damaged

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,888
Famous hotel on Madison Avenue

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
He came up with this crazy plan that he was going to ask for his aunt

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
We walk in the lobby for the Secret Service wouldn't have to worry about us

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
So we go to the hotel

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
Cow he does the thing where in the law

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Bobby

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
And then crazily the elevator door opens and there is

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
President Kennedy steps out of the oven with Jackie well she's immediately grabbed by these reporters in there asking her something and he's

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
Nothing to do so he's a politician he glances around

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
And I am standing behind

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Potted plant

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Staring at him

34
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
Anthony steps towards the bush and he reaches over the bridge of hello young man or something like that

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
And I couldn't speak because there was so much phlegm coming flooding into my throat that I thought I might drown standing up but

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
I took his hand

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
And I shook

38
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
And then

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
He believed he went off to something else and I was just

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Staring at my hands

41
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Completed that day I said

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
My sister

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
I shook

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
President Kennedy's hand

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
And

46
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
I guess I'm not going to wash it

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
Like two days

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Two weeks maybe

49
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
What did she say to you

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
I don't remember what she said but

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
But that's a funny

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Thing to say when 50 years later your science reporter

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Google

54
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Huh

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Because at the moment I thought

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Kennedy Honors Robert I didn't I didn't know that was true it was like a dream

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
I think of celebrities I do

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
But now

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,744
It turns out we can examine the question

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
Scientifically there's no science

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
That can do that

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
What do you mean

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Well

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
First of all we all know this was covered with germs

65
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
But what I did realize that there are

66
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Scientist who say

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
The bacteria honest they claimed was almost like for life

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
So you can be identified

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
By your microbes

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
And these are now making the Bold claim

71
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,928
Did they can check those Mike up to solve crimes to detect diseases

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,280
Do Public Health kind of things

73
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Put them to the test

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Serious

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
I know after this small little up

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Personal history

77
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,384
So I decided to to reproduce the John F Kennedy Robert krulwich handshake

78
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
We could have I could find somebody who would be President Kennedy who would shake my hand and we would measure

79
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
In calculating C

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
So I got a team of producers on a WNYC show only human

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
To help me doing this and we found

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,912
A scientist

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
Is director of the microbiome Center the University of

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Taco

85
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
I don't have President Kennedy around anymore so I got myself you going to be president

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Substitute President Kennedy

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Can you do JFK by Nation

88
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Good for the man on the moon

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
SafeLink

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
This is Neil deGrasse Tyson director of the Hayden planetarium with the American Museum of Natural History here in New York

91
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
You ever been have you ever had your hand shaking by a person who you

92
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Let that you feel

93
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
Like you'd like to have his or her

94
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Steps to stain

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Yeah I'm not that

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,151
Weird or creepy

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,503
I just want to know if you got Carl Sagan

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
Underwear would you keep called phagans underwear

99
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
No

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
But I have

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
I have come to

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Love and embrace

103
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
All bacteria that want a part of my body

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
You are you are awesome

105
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Am I your man for this

106
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
Pick up food that fell on the floor and need me to

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
I don't even wait five seconds

108
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
No one exactly knows the answer was

109
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
But if a person shakes another person's hand

110
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
N4a ordinary injury

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Then the question is

112
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
How much a person a

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Lands on person be and how much a person

114
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Can a stays on person be

115
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
But most crucially for how long

116
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Presumably

117
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Exchange

118
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
Yes so we're nicking off

119
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
You Dragonborn or Miss hands on that I'm looking

120
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,783
Yeah it's I know when I try to find gloves it doesn't work so it's

121
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
3XL

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
XOXO

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
Just so you can get it

124
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
The fact that you are

125
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Carrying all these microbes

126
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
On you

127
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,095
Bring up where are they

128
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
Gastrointestinal tract all the way down your skin

129
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
Young fingernails you urogenital tract

130
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Every part of you that's your butt

131
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Your butt

132
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Especially your butt

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
He's covered in bacteria

134
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
I'm just sitting here you're actually releasing

135
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,015
Into the air around you think pigpen from the Peanuts cartoon member

136
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
About 36 million bacterial cells an hour

137
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
For every minute

138
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
How do they come up with me

139
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
They are leaving off on the on the surface of your skin cells or shedding I'm very old respirations coming out

140
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Okay

141
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
So they

142
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
Lawton on they dry out on the surface

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,751
I'm making literally just drift office dusk the the

144
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
The anatomy of the room

145
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,639
All over this room on the door knob on the table surface on his

146
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Hands

147
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
On the desk

148
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
And on the chairs

149
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
There's Neil everywhere

150
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Colonic

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Writes a lot in my cheek coming out of his

152
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,415
Out of your pants right and there they are on the steps.

153
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
The chair in the deposit

154
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,375
We we I think we understand what you mean

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
So now

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Time question real quick

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Subjective

158
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
20 minutes

159
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
To do

160
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Breast of the sands

161
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
By the way producer

162
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Why do we why do we start experiment now

163
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Are what you going to do

164
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
So what we going to do is we we have little

165
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
My butthole is burning it doesn't mean I'm offering you my boo

166
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
Gut microbes

167
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
70 minutes

168
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,823
Absolutely sir we have these little star all chiefs reach tubes little green

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
Tube has a sterile swab in it with a with a completely sterile tip

170
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
We're going to open that up on very quickly rub

171
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Birth photography

172
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
Each of your hand so your palm the inside of your finger

173
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
I'm going to do that very big Racine and put it as quickly as possible

174
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
Sister control sample

175
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,583
I got to shake hands with the young man over that was Robert

176
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,447
And we're going to definitely I trying to see how many you have received from Neil and how many

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
Neil is received from Robert Leahy is swabbing your hands

178
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
Before you hand shakes so that he can figure out what's the Baseline that you got them both your hands prehension

179
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,503
And he sure you're going to have different bacteria on your on your hands

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
You and you

181
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,367
So this is where it gets very interesting so you have very specific types

182
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Bacteria and he has very

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Types of bacteria that are unique

184
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
I mean I guess like I mean like if I just think about her second like the

185
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
Two of you had different days you arrived in this

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
You probably touched

187
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
Places you eating different things okay maybe a little bit of difference

188
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
But in general

189
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
You are

190
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Those men

191
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,687
Living in New York City breathing the same air ride in the same Subway's exactly so why would you be

192
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
That

193
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Different from one of

194
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
Well because there's one very important difference

195
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Between us

196
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Okay

197
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
We have different mothers

198
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
Have you been told anything like what this is

199
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
Dr. Siobhan Dolan

200
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,495
Assist as well we brought her in because she knows more than most when it comes to moms and babies

201
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
Stream my training years

202
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
Delivered a hundred babies ourselves about 500 babies centers in private practice at Yale New Haven Hospital for a bunch of you

203
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,527
And I probably delivered another couple hundred and I have three kids myself

204
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Other side as well

205
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
And she says as a fetus

206
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Before your born

207
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,279
You know exposed to what's in the amniotic fluid but it's a pretty

208
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Clean

209
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Set up in utero but

210
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,215
Then you go to the vagina and the vagina is just a host of bacteria and

211
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
You know heaston

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,871
Amniotic fluid there's blood or bacterial

213
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Right exactly

214
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,503
Because at this point you're this pristine unadulterated hunk of biomass

215
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
The bacteria

216
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:05,439
Give me a ride I'm going to jump on it cuz that's what

217
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Bacteria to

218
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Finally

219
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
When

220
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
The baby's born

221
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
The doctors they take it to make sure that stable breathing

222
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
And then right up on tomorrow

223
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
Start to immediately promote the bonding and skin to skin

224
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
In your own case if

225
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
If you can remember

226
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
I quit what happens

227
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
What I remember is describing for him like you're mine and I've been waiting nine months to meet you and

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,207
Here you are and like just kind of embracing him and looking in his eyes and soap

229
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,815
There's a sort of bonding there that I will never forget the same moment

230
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,679
You're going to get some micro bonding to I'm it's a it's a very dynamic

231
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,287
Hot and bacterial. They leap from the mom's skin on to the baby

232
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
I did this for both my children night I took both of the month my bed chest at Beth and what you wanted to compete

233
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Against your wife

234
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,063
Absolutely maybe a little bit daddy was a helpful thing you know who knows

235
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Sorry yeah is that that was the reason I did it and the thing is.

236
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
Strains of bacteria that we get in those

237
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
First few hours

238
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
Give me a ride to a lesser degree the bacteria that we meet later in the first year of our life when

239
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,079
Stick weird things in our mouths at the dog comes by those strains of bacteria stick with us

240
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Ready Set forever

241
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Lorena Bobbitt

242
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
As much as possible even the bacteria that Jack will find a tickle

243
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Nils hand

244
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
My hand fingering in between

245
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Are descendants of those first moments of contact

246
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
And crazily enough even if you try to get rid of your bacterial inheritance

247
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
Get rid of all your skin back to you

248
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
Take lots of antibiotics to get rid of all your tummy bacteria

249
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
And then move to some completely different part of the world where the food is different than the temperature different still

250
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
The bacteria you got from your mom will come

251
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Creeping back

252
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
Why why would the why would that be

253
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
Well there's something in ecology cooled

254
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
The founder effect

255
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
Whereby the first organisms

256
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
To get there and to be successful in an environment

257
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Ulta the trajectory

258
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Free of the rest of the ecosystem in

259
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
Change how it develops right

260
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
So you know if a tree

261
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,103
Species and type of tree lines on an island and becomes dominant

262
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
Then it will support the types of beds in the types of monkeys in the types of insects

263
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Love that type of tree

264
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
The same is true in in the microbiome so you know you have a lifelong partnership

265
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
The bacteria you Interactive

266
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,071
So we know that Neil and I each have a unique mix of microbes almost to the point where they like a

267
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Fingerprint

268
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
But if we shake hands the mirror

269
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,287
How much of his is going to get on me how much a mine is going to get on him and most importantly

270
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Is how long will you

271
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
Strange microbial

272
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Last

273
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,247
So you guys got to shake hands I want you shake hands like just as if you were meeting and holding you would like

274
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,343
Hey Neil or Hey Brother nice to meet you and just shake hands

275
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Okay

276
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Not like

277
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Fanfic about how to actually shake at work

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
3

279
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Okay now it was my hand go

280
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,823
Just made my index finger too cuz you got a little

281
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Didn't didn't touch

282
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
And so every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes

283
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Jack's LaBeouf at my hand

284
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
Bacteria but no checking to see if any bacteria moved

285
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
And for how long

286
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
Joy what happened did you did your wife what happened

287
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Well

288
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Why would I tell you now

289
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
When we have the advantage of a short break

290
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
We'll be right back

291
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Listen to call

292
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431

I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

301
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
And I'm here because I need your

302
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
And I request

303
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
For those of you who spend a lot of

304
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Timer kits

305
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Parents

306
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,895
Aunts and uncles teachers were looking for stories about what we're calling

307
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Tiny moments

308
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Brilliant

309
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Basically I want to hear about this

310
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Times when a kid you know did something

311
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
It just means you lean back and say

312
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Well

313
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
How did they do

314
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Maybe it was the moment that I

315
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
Kids started reading back

316
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
To you

317
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

318
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,679
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

319
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry

320
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
We're interested in the

321
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Epic moments where

322
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
Kid does something super smart

323
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
It doesn't have anything to do with it

324
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
If you have a story

Robert Neal

336
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Just shaking hands and Jack

337
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Gilbert was going to swap those

338
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,391
Sans write 1 minutes off the handshake

339
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Then around every 5 minutes for about 25 min

340
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:06,143
Bacteria back to the lab and he identified are bacteria by their DNA

341
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,543
That means

342
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
Well yes it is a holy signs it's

Rena Ware still researching and developing

345
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
And it will take many years before we're ready for Primetime but Jack says they are now at the phase where they can look into all kind

346
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
Kinds of different applications for this new microbiome detecting

347
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Take me to Tampa forensic

348
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,863
Imagine if somebody comes into a room and doesn't evil deed

349
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Right now we know that when somebody interrupts

350
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Without space.

351
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
15 minutes

352
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
They leave behind enough of the signature

353
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
2 Frost builds text

354
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
30 minutes later

355
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,711
If I had to pick between 3 people or full people that would break into a room

356
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
There's a good possibility that I could detect which one of them had broken into that room and they're only going to get better in bed

357
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,743
Do you think maybe one day you'll be able to track somebody like outside moving moving around

358
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,351
Shirley on the base in the bacteria that they leave behind back exactly what we're investigating

359
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,959
He also says being able to identify bacteria in a town sewer system

360
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,311
Be a really useful in helping us to predict a potential outbreak

361
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,431
By noticing that there's a disease-causing bacteria right in the sewage so you can go to town

362
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,063
And before anyone begins to show symptoms you can say to my way to second we got a quarantine vaccinate we got to do something here

363
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
Nip it in the bud if you will before it becomes

364
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
A problem

365
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
And as you may have heard this plenty of research

366
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Looking at the microbiome

367
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Inside

368
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
Is revolutionising better

369
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
I mean we already have evidence that we can

370
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
Determine whether somebody will have a bad response

371
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Stewart rug

372
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Based on the bacteria that oppress

373
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
Inside them so we can screen them

374
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Using the microbiome to

375
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
To determine if they have that like the outcome

376
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
But for now

377
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
Back to this absolutely crucial

378
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
And breath

379
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
Taking a spare so let me just quickly remind you of the situation we left

380
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Do you and I talked a couple of weeks later

381
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
We got the result

382
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Quotes from Jack and so I decided to go to Neil

383
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
To deliver

384
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
And just to set up expectations here Jack told us

385
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
What he expected was immediately after a handshake a little bit of me would be on Neil

386
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,031
A little bit of deal would be on me and that

387
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
Pretty fast the bacteria would die

388
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
And be gone

389
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
However

390
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
I am very happy to say

391
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
That

392
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Is not

393
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
What happened what percentage change

394
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Yes

395
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
You caused

396
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
On me of me on you

397
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
10%

398
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
10%

399
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
I can't imagine it

400
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
I would say 1% 10%

401
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
But not much less than 1%

402
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
What was less than 10

403
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
When they came back

404
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
It was significantly less than 10

405
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Okay

406
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
It was

407
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
0

408
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
0

409
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,063
What can it be below there whatever is this

410
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,903
Actually found a teeny number back here but they die

411
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Nothing

412
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
From the

413
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Nothing it's just it's just

414
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Should I put it that way

415
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
I mean

416
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
That was quite shocking

417
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
I we were expecting that to be a lot more bacteria

418
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Being transferred

419
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Change

420
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:29,151
So that you know that one person picks up the other person picks up 10/12 bacteria

421
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
I think you might have washed your hand immediately

422
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,343
No there's no no no sabotage running

423
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
I hate antibacterial

424
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
I don't use what he called a

425
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Purell

426
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Yeah I never use any of

427
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:48,863
So for reasons that are at this moment totally unknown Neil's bacteria simply failed

428
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Completely

429
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
2

430
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Affect my hands

431
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
The other side of this equation is

432
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
What would you guess the present

433
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Might microbes on you

434
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Okay what I know from physics

435
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Surfaces

436
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Is

437
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
If they have approximately the same

438
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
Coefficient of friction

439
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Then it's a it's a

440
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Complete two-way street

441
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
If I gave you nothing you would have given me nothing

442
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Is my

443
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Guess

444
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Here's what happened he

445
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Definitely picked up bacteria from you and that led to quite substantial disruption it turns out

446
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Hi

447
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Your hand

448
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
You tell me you were

449
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
Skank nasty

450
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,807
I came on today funky the percentage

451
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
Before the handshake was that you and I was six

452
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
50%

453
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
The same 40% differ

454
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Post Shake

455
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
You are more than 75

456
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,583
Scarlet

457
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
You made him more You by 15% at least I was swerving all over again

458
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
Slightly proud and control all the time

459
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Staying and staying and stink

460
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
Every time

461
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
I was still there

462
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
6 minutes later at 12. Nasty

463
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,464
Could have been an hour later might still be on his hand like yeah I mean there's no indication that they were in 2K

464
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
When I left you were covered with

465
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
Let the record show he beat his chest in that moment it looks like there is a possibility that some of them could have gone

466
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,080
I think tonight you think that I might stay on him

467
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,664
I want a what I think is that there's a high probability

468
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,016
But some of those organisms once they set up shop on his hand in those initial 20 minutes

469
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Could stay on his hand

470
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
What you mean like forever like

471
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Forever and ever

472
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,392
If there is a possibility

473
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
There's a possibility

474
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Versace

475
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
Do you have any idea where they're what we've just described is typical of a common handshake experience

476
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
This is a typical

477
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
I'll be because they may be old outcompeting

478
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Directions to understand his house

479
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
Strange this result is think about it this way

480
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Two hands coming together

481
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,648
It's like taking a rainforest from Bolivia Anixter and dumping it on top of the rainforest in Brazil

482
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,328
I was wondering whether any of the trees from the Bolivian rainforest will take roots and you know an adapt and become pretty

483
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
You all

484
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
Bacteria have home-field advantage

485
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
They are abundant in the dominant tonight in Parma

486
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
Then we would generally suspected

487
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,432
Very quickly the invading microbes. To die

488
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
The killed off

489
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
I'm pissed off

490
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
And I hope they just becoming a

491
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
It's always happens and it's over and nobody wins

492
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Versace

493
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Best mutual decay

494
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,256
So am I now successful invasive species on his hand

495
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,376
Some of your microbes are successful invasive species that yeah absolutely

496
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
How are you

497
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Spleen mice

498
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,544
Success what we think actually happened is that something disrupted nilsy Coast

499
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Right

500
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
I'm with think

501
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
Based on the analysis that there was a stripped

502
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Secaucus

503
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,504
Which is usually quite rare but that doesn't sound so good step 2

504
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Well their loss of species

505
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Streptococcus

506
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
No tolls in the pathogenic

507
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
So there was a stripper

508
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,488
The caucus that was very abundant on your hand the beginning

509
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
That was transferred to Niels how do we see that transfer caring

510
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
I'm not streptococcus somehow

511
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm disrupted music

512
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
System and allowed for a greater trend

513
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Bacteria

514
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
From your hand to his hand

515
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Oh man

516
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,456
That's like a little band of like murderous little bacteria

517
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
And it cleared away the forest

518
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
And then let's sit at the rest of you could come in and colonize I don't know I don't think anybody knows the answer that question all I know is that I'm

519
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
Name all over them

520
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Out of my soul Robert

521
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
Slaughtered on my body that's fine

522
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Don t feel any defensiveness

523
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Towards the fact that he managed to

524
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Conquer your microbiome and yet yours

525
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
Was unable to do the same to him

526
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
That by the way is producer Simon Adler

527
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
So

528
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
The word conquer in that context I would

529
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
Reword this sentence and say

530
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
My microbiome was perfectly content staying where it is

531
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
Apparently Roberts

532
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
Microbiome

533
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
Can't wait to get the hell off his body

534
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Men

535
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,840
I came here thinking I would find out how long president

536
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Kennedy stayed on me

537
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Now there's suddenly a new question

538
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Cuz if he's a cool cucumber

539
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
It's all on you stayed on him

540
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Yeah

541
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
I believe

542
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,048
Maybe you were the anomaly

543
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
You're the creepy sweaty man with

544
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Wet Palms

545
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
That's what you came here for

546
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
When did

547
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,960
Big big things to astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson

548
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
For a

549
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Putting up with this

550
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
Shenanigans I can go 5 days without a shower

551
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
And you wouldn't know it

552
