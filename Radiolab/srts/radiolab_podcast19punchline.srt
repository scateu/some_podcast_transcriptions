00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,408
Gate jet here before we get to the show I want to reintroduce you to

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,224
What's a my name is Amy

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,064
Remember Amy from an episode we did a couple years ago about

11
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,880
Ticks and meat allergies and

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
We brought her back into the studio because she is now

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
Hosting your own podcast

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
It's pretty great

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Call ten things

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328

End the show 10 things that scare me

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Name kind of says it all

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Because a couple times a week they put out of show

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Would they come out three times a week so holy moly

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
The really short

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
I mean for podcast

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Unprecedented

24
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Each episode is only

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
About 5 minutes

26
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Microdose

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832

Steers and explaining why each of those 10 things scare them

31
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
What was the idea behind it

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Add

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328

A recording of their kid

43
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
Has made a list of things

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
We think are really

45
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Scary a recording of things that they were afraid of because

46
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Of the pipes

47
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
The pipes of scary when you look up at them

48
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
They look like they're going to suck you into the tube

49
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,384
And I listen to it so many times because I'm going to take you back to like

00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Those pipes are scary

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Until she was like if it's compelling

52
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
To keep your kids talk about their

53
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
You don't even really know

54
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672

Who else will reporter

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,352
The the way I first learned about the story is that I saw that there was this article trending in this

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,960
The players Tribune which is like a ton of athletes

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240

00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
But anyway that

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
The

92
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
The thing that

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Jumped out to me

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
About this article

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Is that it's a sport story but it's

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,791
Is actually so much more like it is a story about

97
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Voting

98
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
About cyberbullying

99
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
The story about you know

100
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
Taking it to the establishment it's a

101
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
It's a sports story but it's

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Like is one that

103
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,871
Feels like it could only have happened at this very specific moment that we're living in

104
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,711
Right now yeah I mean I don't know if we can always

105
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Paint

106
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Sports as a microcosm of

107
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Society

108
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
But in this case

109
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
It's undeniable that it was

110
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
To the whole story starts with this guy

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Graduation

112
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Hockey stuff

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Greg is a hockey Journal a senior NHL writer for ESPN known to his Legions of fans

Puff Daddy

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,871
That is self given name know he got it from his editor when he first started blogging about hockey the other option

116
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
The time was Zamboni Pony

117
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Which would have been a horrible name

118
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
And I very much avoided an entire

119
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
You know 10-year Runner

120
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
People calling me the pony true

121
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Right but now I have bites

122
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Avenue

123
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
I am ready to roll now

124
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Okay well let's just jump in

125
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
Yeah so we our lives

126
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
Story really begins on the podcast that I did with the gentleman by the name of Jeff Marek

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
Basically couple hockey writers

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,431
Shooting the breeze on hockey

129
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,415
November 2015 few months before the NHL

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
You know big midseason

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Spectacle

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,887
To Amalie Arena All-Star Game

133
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
There's a sense

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Should I have

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
About this game

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
It's worrisome

137
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Is this year

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Yet again

139
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
The NHL for the hundredth time in the last 15 years

140
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Changing the format of the all-star

141
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
Hockey typically five-on-five 3 on 3 however is supposed to be like

142
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
You know way more action

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Taurus

144
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Jogasaki puree

145
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
They're like yet again the NHL is just changing things up to get more eyeballs on this game that

146
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
By this point has just become water down

147
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Cast

148
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
Joke of a game

149
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,623
So the two of them as many die-hard traditionalists do

150
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Go off on the NHL

151
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
And eventually that leads them to talk about the other what they see is the other really dumb thing about that year

152
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
All-Star Game

153
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Fan voting has long been apart of the game

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
The kid

155
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
There's nothing else better

156
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Then grab a little punch card

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
At a game

158
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
I trying to grab like 30 of them

159
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
To make sure that you know

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Kirk Muller

161
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
But over the years the NHL have started reducing the number of players that could get voted in one year they were Eva

162
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Turning off the boat when they didn't like where it was

163
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Headed

164
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
And anyway this year

165
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
The NHL has limited the vote so much

166
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
Did the fans could only vote in

167
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
4 players

168
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
The captain Bridge division the Pacific to Central the Atlantic the Metropolitan

169
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
4 players

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
All you could vote in

171
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
What the All-Star Game

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
History tradition should be to what we really want

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
With this All-Star game which is

174
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Fan engagement

175
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
I just hope that everyone

176
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
That somehow a collective and maybe we can meet

177
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
And that point they start thinking

178
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
What if we use the little voting power that we do have

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Mess with the all-star

180
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,959
We need some we need someone in there who normally would not be in this game

181
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Like is a joke

182
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
We should vote somebody in who just does not

183
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
And Greg's like I like that thought

184
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Okay

185
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
But who

186
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,319
Fit the bill there and it was thinking about it he thought you won't be funny

187
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
You don't really mess with you

188
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
Is if we told in a player player who couldn't really keep up couldn't really shoot couldn't really handle the podcast

189
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
The slow guy with a bad hands

190
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
What's what's what's really you know drop a stink bomb in the room

191
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
And then

192
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Github

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
The perfect guy

194
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
A Goliath of the league

195
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Oh my God John Scott All-Star

196
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
John Scott

197
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,815
He was a guy that would only play between like 5 and 8 minutes and night couldn't really shoe

198
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Couldn't really stay and on top of that

199
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,615
When John Scott was on the eye

200
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
Unacceptable the only thing he was good at knocking other people

201
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
In hockey terms

202
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,255
Scott has a predator John Scott was what you would call

203
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
An Old Fashioned

204
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Goon

205
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
Oh my God that's the one he's the one

206
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,799
From that point on there was no other answer to the question like that was the guy that it would have to be

207
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,831
And what started there as a train joke between two guys on a podcast

208
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
Would end up wasting the fate and Fortune of one of the most

209
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Beard load

210
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Punishing players

211
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,887
In the National Hockey League

212
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911

To really understand what it was like for John to be on the other end of that to be like

225
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
You know what the butt of a joke

226
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
You need to understand what

227
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Hakeem antigen

228
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,031
Like what it meant for him to be playing in the NHL

229
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Like everyone has their dreams like

230
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
When your kid Express Estates football baseball Canada

231
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
When you ask a 7 8 year old weigh

232
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
We do those projects in class what do you want to be when you grow up

233
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
And I think 90% of the boys

234
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm going to be in the NHL and I always said that my parents have all that stuff all over the walls and stuff

235
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
But yeah I always

236
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
Dreamed of playing NHL I think everybody

237
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
That was a big dream so

238
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Yeah so John has dis

239
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Classic Canadian hockey kids

240
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
StoryBots on skates when I was three my dad built the rink in the backyard played all the time every single day morning Newnan

241
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
And you just go to sleep in your gear and wake up and just jump right on the ice

242
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Skate until 7 or 8 at night

243
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
And you just jump in bed and go to sleep and he just kept it on to save times.

244
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
But

245
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
The thing about John

246
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,623
With that even as a kid I was a monster

247
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
I came out of the womb

248
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
20

249
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
420

250
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
524 and a 1/2 in long and I was

12 lb I was huge

253
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
School pictures with a joke everyone thought it was like

254
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
A teacher's assistant when I hit like grade

255
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Seven ate nine because I was so tall

256
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
And

257
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
When you're young and you that's all you have

258
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
0

259
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Zero coordination

260
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Until John was

261
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Never the top Dynasty

262
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Never the fastest

263
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
It's never the most skilled never

264
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
You know the best of anything I just kind of telling my daughter to start applying to panel beside us

265

Oh yeah I'm not I mean I feel like compared to you you've been all over the map for real

281
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647

Perfect

285
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
What kind of chips you have

286
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,215
You can put her down so easily

287
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
I don't know how we lucked out with her

288
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
She was on number 5 in

289
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
We needed that.

290
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
But perfectly evident

291
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
We're back alright let's let's get back

292
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Okay we're back

293
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Jump back in

294
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
John plays throughout his school years by the time he's getting closed

295
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
College a lot of his friends are getting

296
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
You know offers scholarships to different

297
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah big-time schools University of Minnesota Boston College places like that

298
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
4 John

299
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
There was just no intro

300
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Like the coaches thought he was too big to play wouldn't be able to

301
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
Keep up out there on the ice

302
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,663
But eventually he did get one offer to play for a mid-level university

303
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Michigan

304
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
And I just figured I would

305
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,111
In all honesty I would finish college and get a job that would be it I would have got an education for free and

306
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
You know I play hockey with

307
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
The guys on the weekends but that was down to the end of hockey

308
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
But then a couple of things

309
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,631
First at school I kind of always noticed him because he was

310
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
About 2 ft taller than anybody else on campus

311
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,055
Engineering student started dating senior year

312
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
The rest of History

313
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,455
Any other thing that happened was I got this opportunity to go play

314
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Time for the Houston Aeros

315
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,623
Minnesota farm team minor league team that wasn't crazy money it was 30,000 or 35,000

316
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
To talk to Danielle about it he was like

317
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Well let me give this hockey thing

318
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
Like a go because the only chance I'm going to get to be able to say I played Pro

319
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
In the way that I kind of looked at it was okay

320
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
It's just like

321
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
A little head

322
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
Start and then once I graduate like we'll both get our jobs like a real job

323
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
And move on with our lives

324
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,647
So John moved down to Houston I didn't have any expectations I just work my tail off I was the bad skater I work

325
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,231
At skating I was a bad pastor I would work at passing after practice

326
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
But he says no matter what he did

327
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
He would not get any pie

328
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
I was always a step or two behind

329
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,263
I think the ninth defenseman on the roster and you only dress 6 for a game so I never played

330
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
The first

331
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
I think month of the season

332
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Buljan was in Houston

333
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Notice

334
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
If there were these other big guys on the team

335
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
And they were getting

336
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
They they kind of took me under their wings

337
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
And they said Hey listen

338
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
If you really want to get noticed on your if you really want to go to the NHL

339
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
You should learn how to fight

340
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
It work perfect

341
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Play because that's what happened

342
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
So for those of you who don't follow hockey

343
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
I have guys in my team

344
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,223
Million nine million eight million dollars and they are paid the score and they are paid to perform and play well

345
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
But there are also guys out there who their job is to

346
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,255
Pester annoy and we call them the rats the pest

347
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,583
And you can hear these guys like when they're mic'd up

348
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Like 10 guys her right now running their mouths they try to get under the star players skin

349
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
How do you spell star players put sometimes

350
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
Immortal check them into the Borg

351
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
Dope in order to deal with past

352
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
You got people like John

353
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Floor

354
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Called

355
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Enforcer

356
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,863
So basically my job is to make sure those pests

357
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Don't pester my top guys

358
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
And so when we would go into a game

359
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,615
I would know exactly who to pinpoint because you know you do your scouting and I would go up to those guys and I would say Hey listen

360
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
If you're going to do that I'm going to

361
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Put my fist through your face

362
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
And more often

363
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Minaj

364
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
The fear of

365
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
The retribution if they did something with

366
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Would stop them

367
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
Can you could see the frustration in Big John Scott.

368
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,023
But if they did do something my job was to beat them up

369
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
And I was the heck of a fighter when I made the NHL

370
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
They wouldn't fight I would usually grab their tough guy

371
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:01,343
And beat him up if we were playing flat and we didn't have energy

372
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
Big John Scott trying to spark his team I would go out and try to fight to get my guys going

373
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:14,143
Or if it was a really bad head I would just grab that guy and I would be his doors off

374
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
Itsfunneh throughout my career I really hated fighting

375
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,639
Thursday's I wouldn't sleep at night just because I knew I was going to get into a fight but

376
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
You just do your job

377
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
And I think I did my job well

378
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,111
Well enough that John was able to make a career in the NHL it's everything you dream of as a kid

379
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
It's kind of like a leap of faith and it worked out great

380
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
So by this point Danielle and John had gotten married you know we had bought our first house ever had their first tooth

381
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Kids beyond anything we

382
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Are I ever expected

383
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,847
Will tell me tell me all the names of all the teams that you played for omigod so I'm embarrassed

384
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,503
Doe in 2008 John started playing in the NHL for the Minnesota Wild

385
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
After that he played for

386
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Chicago in New York

387
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Buffalo in San Jose

388
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
And and throw his whole career as an enforcer

389
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
There was this shift going on

390
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
In professional

391
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Justin incredible

392
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,191
Printable play a lot of the hockey establishment in the media decks in the league

393
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
We're pushing for the game to be more heists

394
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Anymore about

395
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Gil

396
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
And a lot of people started coming out and saying there should not be a place in this week

397
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
For fighting I was an easy target

398
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
This guy

399
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
Is it cool if you haven't seen the movie you don't have

400
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Have to bother this is

401
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,231
They went after me and they said listen we don't need guys like this in the league has no room

402
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Forward in the game

403
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
There's no room

404
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,911
Their sole purpose is to punch people

405
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Not simply

406
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Ignite a fight

407
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
You were going to eliminate

408
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Players like this

409
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,127
Which is one of the reasons why

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,735
Four guys like Greg wyshynski and Jeff Marek

411
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Booting John Scott in the All-Star game was not

412
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Just a hilarious joke about a big I couldn't skate

413
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
What is also a big fat middle finger

414
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
To the hockey is

415
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm sorry I'll just do the whole day

416
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
The big point I do it I was we were

417
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
On the road and we are on the bus heading to

418
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,055
A game or pre-game skate it was December 2015 John was playing for the Arizona Coyotes

419
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,151
And a guy my team Anders lindback gargar goalie he

420
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,991
Was sitting beside me and he's like a year you know you're in

421
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
It was like 56 place or something you know

422
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,927
About the fan voting I was like oh you know it's great people think it's a joke they're going to vote

423
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
For me a little bit and it was it was nothing

424
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Seriously that's how I first heard of it on the bus

425
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
So we go to the we go to the rink we do our skate

426
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
Literally after the skate

427
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
He checks his phone again and he's like holy comment your like

428
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Top 25

429
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
It happened that fast

430
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
And then

431
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
The next day I was top 5 and then like the day after that I was number one

432
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,783
There's a surprise leader in fan voting for the upcoming NHL All-Star Game and his name is

433
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
John Scott

434
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
So is like a

435
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
For the mega story. Is leading the NHL

436
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
It was unbelievable how quickly accrue

437
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,376
Number one the number one vote-getter among all players in the NHL

438
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
Which method would be at All-Star Game captain

439
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
King cat

440
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
At the All-Star Game

441
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
Let that sink in for a second

442
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,944
And for the fans who were voting for John there's definitely a bit of like oh you Shrunk the number of players we can vote in

443
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Oh really

444
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Here's Johnny

445
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,136
But I think for a majority of Voters voting for John

446
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
It was just released

447
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
The reason John Scott's leading voting is because it's funny

448
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
John Scott is not an ulcer

449
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
Star is one goal over eight games he barely plays

450
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Skill

451
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Wouldn't it be funny to see this

452
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
Arizona Coyotes thun ogre objectively bad at hockey

453
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
I don't know what he's doing in the league

454
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,040
Make a fool of himself though I hated it

455
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
This isn't funny anymore I get it like on this

456
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Durable player who

457
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:23,488
You guys think would be fun to watch me you know fail in this game but

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,608
I just figured it would end on its own honestly I thought it would last a few days and people would get

459
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
Me and older enough of it and it would go away but it just didn't

460
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
And that's for the NHL

461
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
They were pissed

462
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Frankly

463
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
I definitely got the sense

464
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,224
From some of the people that I speak to you on a regular basis the NHL that they were really

465
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
Angry this was happen

466
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
And white like I can you get any more specific about like why this would have been an embarrassment to them like what is it exactly that they

467
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
They were so sensitive about about the fact that the All-Star game is something that a lot of old-time

468
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
I'm hockey people and there's a lot of old time hockey

469
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
People that run the National Hockey League

470
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
See as something prestigious

471
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
One of the ultimate honors for a player

472
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
And so

473
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
This was not something they wanted to happen

474
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,688
And it was happening and they didn't really know what to do about it

475
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
Because they didn't have any fail-safes

476
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Someplace to Ravenna from half

477
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:23,136
After one day of John sitting atop the All-Star vote

478
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Kids are sleeping

479
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
John gets a text

480
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,280
He gets about a bed cuz overdose phone starts reading it

481
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
And he's

482
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
Standing there for a while

483
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,680
Selfishly I'm just want to go to bed but then

484
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
You know I can sell something

485
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Just got him

486
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Doing over there and it was his

487
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
PR guy from

488
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
My coyote

489
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
Say they thought it'd be a good idea really

490
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Statement and

491
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
They rolled up this statement for me

492
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,832
And they basically said thank you for the support I don't want your votes please vote for other guys on my team

493
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,160
Basically his own team is saying step away for

494
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
From the All-Star Game

495
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,328
I saw him like respond yeah that statements fine and then delete it and then just sit there and look at it

496
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
And I just remember us

497
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,192
Acting like see you deep would you want to go and he's

498
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Just like what yeah I think

499
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
Cuz as a kid I watched all the All Star Games

500
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
It was so

501
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Fun to watch in Iowa

502
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Dream to be in

503
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
So yeah

504
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm like woah

505
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,272
They want you to release the statement released a statement but make sure that it's

506
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
True

507
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
I'm so John and separating statement that reads

508
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Quote

509
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
It's nice to be thought of by all of the fans

510
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
And for that I am truly flattered and grateful

511
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
And while I would love to experience an All-Star Game

512
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
I think a few of my teammates are a bit more deserving of

513
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Enzo tour lights

514
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
I would go if I get voted

515
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
But there's other people who deserve it

516
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,176
I said yeah sure send it out I wasn't totally on board with that but I just wanted to appease the higher-ups to hopefully

517
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Help them

518
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
But even after that

519
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
It was

520
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Still John's got number one go-getter

521
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Go by far yeah it

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
It's funny they stop showing how many votes to players were getting

523
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,744
They took that option off the website because I think I was ahead by SoMo

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
You broke the website

525
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
Yeah I still they they took that away and then

526
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
The NHL

527
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
Babe really try to strong-arm me what happened there so I was in my bedroom in Arizona and they called

528
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
And

529
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,360
It was one of the higher-ups in the NHL and he's a

530
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,688
You want to know how I was feeling was getting really close to the end of the voting

531
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:28,320
I just said yeah you know I want to go to the game I think it'll be fun I think it'll be good for everybody involved

532
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,672
And he's like really you sure like you think you'll be able to keep up

533
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
You think you're good enough like guy you're not exactly a skill guy John and they started that way and I just kind of brushed it off you know I was like yeah

534
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
You can stay pretty well I'm a good Dees

535
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Easton hockey player

536
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
And he was well you know

537
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
What it what do you still talk to your dad what do you think

538
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Percy goes are you is your dad alive and I'd like

539
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Ohio

540
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,456
What do you think he's going to think about this situation you know you think you're going to make him proud

541
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
And I was like what's like

542
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,624
I don't think that has anything to do with this and I kind of brushed at off in at this time I'm getting a little angry

543
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Because I'm sick man

544
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
Flip and fly and then he's like whoa

545
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,072
What do you think your kids are going to think when they only look back on this

546
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
If you think they're going to proud of their daddy

547
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Who went to the All-Star Game this way

548
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,312
And as soon as he brought my kids into the equation I just like lost it

549
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
And I kind of snapped back at him like you're being a real

550
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
Sleeping sleeping sleeping sleeping on your back

551
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784

Snapback is Michael Lee, yelling at one of the head guys in NHL I should like

And I've requests

573
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

574
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
Aunts and uncles teachers

575
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

576
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Childhood brilliance

577
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
Basically I want to hear about this

578
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,352
Times when a kid you know did something

579
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
It just means you lean back and say

580
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Wow

581
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,568
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

582
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
To you

583
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

584
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,736
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

585
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music

586
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
In the margin of their geometry

587
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
We're interested in the

588
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Epic moments where

589
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
A kid does something super smart

590
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
It doesn't have anything to do with it

591
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
If you have a story

592
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840

You know we we needed a little defensive help and we traded you to Montreal for this guy

613

You know Walks Like A Duck talks like a duck to 38 Special

622
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,064
We called John's former team and the NHL about this neither wanted to talk

623
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
Nonetheless what happened next is that a short while later

I saw this news hit

698
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
And my first reaction was you have

699
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Got to be kidding me

700
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,200
Greg wyshynski started the John Scott for All-Star campaign

701
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224

I started this

704
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
This is on me

705
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
No because

706
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
At that point

707
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
You know there had been criticized

708
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
System of us

709
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
4

710
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:10,144
Having this campaign and obviously when John Scott came out I was like you guys ruined my career this sucks

711
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Caputo

712
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Right off the bat

713
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Made you feel like maybe you've done something

714
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Kind of bad dude dude

715
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
But the campaigner kind of Taken on a life

716
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
If its own

717
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
And at that point

718
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
John Scott said he wanted to be an All-Star wanted to represent

719
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
A certain type of

720
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,600
Player my role is like almost extinct I'm like the last of my

721
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:34,208
Kind of here in like oh be cool to go out with a bang all of his friends were saying you should do it

722
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,816
He wanted to do it because people are selling them

723
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
Your fault or anything but in a way that like

724
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Youjizz

725
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
And not that you could have forced

726
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
You started

727
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
The train was their party that was like

728
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Oh my God like if I had

729
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
Said that one thing on my podcast

730
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,944
Like this guy wouldn't have had to uproot his whole life I mean again like I feel like

731
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
It was the National Hockey League

732
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
That was

733
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Standing in his way

734
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,416
Now whatever you think about the initial prank or John being demoted

735
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
This is the moment

736
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
When the crowd mood

737
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Totally shifted

738
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
Complete outrage this is trash

739
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
The computer outrage this is garbage

740
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:22,336
I'm not going to go about a democracy it became protest

741
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,176
Online is a lousy thing to do

742
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Sweeping through the hockey world

743
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Like

744
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
The fans voted this guy in

745
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:36,160
The NHL is doing all it can to keep this guy out and that's not right you want to change this

Since the NHL is so damn image-conscious why don't you put pressure

750
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
On your

751
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
Favorite reporter

00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
Stick up for John Scott

753
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
I Can Only Imagine

754
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
How John feels

755
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
Pissed off

756
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,248
Sorry for yourself and you feel you get sad boy want to play hockey

757
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
What do I want to do like guy

758
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
Do I just quit talking go work like you think about all these things

759
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
Now that you're in the minor leagues

760
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
Are you allowed to

761
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Play for the All-Star Game

762
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
That's the thing no one knew

763
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
He says right after he

764
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
He was demoted to the minor league

765
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,424
People started did you know read through the by-laws read through the books

766
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Trying to figure out like

767
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
Hen a minor league player

768
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Play in the

769
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
Professional

770
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
NHL All-Star

771
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,944
And it turns out there was no rule that even remotely address

772
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Situation like

773
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
It was totally impressive

774
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,088
And so the pressure stayed on the NHL new

775
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
That

776
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
If John Scott wasn't in the All-Star Game

777
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
There's probably Visions from the NHL of protest signs along the glass

778
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
The band out the outside the arena holding a rally because John Scott was

779
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
And according to Greg hockey

780
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Keep an czarnota

781
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Aureus

782
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
For throwing jerseys on the ice

783
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
Protest causing

784
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,336
Scenes and eventually

785
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,968
The National Hockey League had to acquiesce they put out a statement they made a statement saying hey if John wants to go you can go

786
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,296
But John says at this point I told everybody I'm not going

787
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
Like nhlpa I told all my friends

788
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
The teammates like I'm done like this is a bogus sick I don't want to do this he says between the fans making fun of him and Allie demoting him

789
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
The whole thing was just

790
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Just to humiliate

791
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
But I was

792
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Was just like

793
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
John

794
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,984
Yuan may regret that I know you want to like

795
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,080
Run away and hide right now and like going in front of all these people the very last

796
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Nothing you want to do

797
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
But you might regret it

798
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
She's like let's go it'll be fun for the family the kids will love it

799
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
I would love to see you going through these people wrong

800
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
My wife was building me back up and

801
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Slowly but surely I was like okay you know what

802
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
F*** this

803
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
Let's do it

804
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,912
Very impressive

805
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
January 31st

806
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
2016

807
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,824
The complete circus it was unbelievable

808
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
I was obviously the big story so the moment I land there is reporters everywhere ask me questions

809
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
I would be representing the

810
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
Pacific Division in the All-Star Game

811
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
And we had to play

812
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,928
It was essential who everyone said they were stacked because they had all the

813
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
Stud players on our team

814
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,488
Players play

815
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,400
Patty dushane James Neal all of you much younger much higher

816
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
A player

817
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
And then you had

818
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,336
John I knew everybody was staring at me and I'm weird about my hair cuz I'm

819
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Going bald and I'm

820
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
Skate around like I wish I would have grabbed my hat

821
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
McDaniel

822
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Everything is buzzing

823
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
Danielle from the stands there two little kids everybody's looking for him.

824
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,672
Stay off this dumb he's going to make it nasty

825
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,768
And before the game the coach comes up to him to ask me if I wanted to

826
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
The starting I just said no

827
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Please let me stay on the bench

828
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Nicole chisley

829
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
All right

830
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
But you're going in early

831
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
John teammates get out to center ice

832
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
He's sitting on the bench butterflies in its stomach

833
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
Karina and goal

834
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,480
Ref drop the puck

835
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
Right away

836
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
26 seconds into the game

837
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Jaheim

838
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Go down one nothing

839
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,144
Literally one not too late and how about the hands in the playmate from the Maddie Duchesne right there on the Colorado Avalanche

840
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Brilliant Steve

841
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,312
The James Neal it was like it was like

842
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
It was a goal that all stars

843
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Gunsmoke

844
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Scott

845
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
You're in

846
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,856
Remember this is three-on-three there is a ton of open eyes there's nowhere to go like there's nowhere to hide

847
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
And John says it's kept thinking

848
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Don't mess up

849
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
Don't mess up

850
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't make a fool yourself that's all I was thinking of

851
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Rats got the puck

852
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,168
Hold it about Center Ice I don't belong here I think you're a joke don't screw it up

853
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
Drop set what's the puck drop

854
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:17,248
You just kind of you know everything else goes away

855
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
Can you just start playing hockey

856
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:30,048
This was like going back to when I was younger I wasn't the best I was in the fastest but you and I know you just start playing

857
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
And that's what I did

858
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
This time

859
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,592
John Cena

860
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Frenzy at the park

861
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
We're going up the ice

862
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,272
John and the team is charged across Center Ice they move into their opponent Zone

863
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
When

864
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,648
Brent Burns passes the puck to John

865
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,024
John manages to control it kind of up against the boards so he's using his body to protect

866
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,328
Tupac trying to figure out what to do next

867
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,264
Burnsy had to park on the right wing and all the sudden I notice

868
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,640
Between two of the Defenders there's a nice little Lane right to the net I went to the net

869
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,712
Burn spotted Johnny what the f*** rate on my

870
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Stick

871
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,320
John's just like a few feet from goal in the Ghoulies actually out of

872
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,112
Position that a wide open net

873
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,696
And I shot it and I missed the net

874
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
Like a like a white oak

875
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Open Nat

876
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,376
But the goalie was luckily sliding back into position

877
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
So the puck

878
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Hit the goalie

879
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Bounce

880
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Off the goalie

881
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
And into the back of the net

882
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
There you go

883
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,112
It was awesome like I was so jacked up by Goosebumps like after the goal I was so need

884
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
It was cool

885
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
That was anything the crowd I didn't know how they were going to react

886
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
Usually they boo me

887
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,424
Everybody boo'd me and they they they are all for it

888
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
The weird thing about the masses

889
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Two it's like

890
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
How quickly everybody can go from hating you

891
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
You to loving you

892
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
It was such a sense of relief for me

893
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
The huge monkey

894
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,392
Was lifted off my back cuz I was like okay

895
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,488
I did something for the team I didn't mess up he's going to relax

896
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Have fun

897
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Just playing

898
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
Be himself in place which he did

899
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:52,128
Laid out the guy Patrick Kane

900
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:04,927
Drop the glove pretended to have a fight

901
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:11,327
He got a couple make passes at a real

902
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,655
Bluetooth shot on goal he was just kind of doing everything

903
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
Everytime John Scott

904
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,519
Was on camera or touch the puck the crowd would come to life

905
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,199
Greg wyshynski was actually they're reporting at the game and he was down in the tunnel

906
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,343
What happens when you're down in the bowels of the arena is at the All-Star games on TVs

907
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
But there is a

908
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
Delay between what the broadcast has and what's happening

909
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
On the ice

910
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,791
So typically you'll hear something happen in the game

911
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Before you actually watch it on TV

912
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
And I remember hearing this

913
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,959
Gigantic Roar from the

914
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Crap

915
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
And then everybody kind of looked over at the

916
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
The TV

917
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
And watch the all-star

918
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
If tie-dye shootout

919
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
What happened with a listed it. Rohr was that it was getting to the end of the game tight game

920
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
Johnson was up by one we were in our Zone

921
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
Point defense all of a sudden

922
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,351
13 shot it

923
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
We had a save and burns you got the puck behind the net

924
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
End

925
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
I just

926
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,055
Bluetooth on a skid loaders on as fast as I could cuz I knew he was going to get it

927
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
He saw me up in that all I need

928
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,687
Fire tonight pass and I corralled it

929
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
Took off down the center of the ice

930
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,111
They had someone hounding me able to keep the defender off of them

931
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
So it was just John

932
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
The goalie

933
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
And then that

934
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,535
Gather dipakai Ripa shot top corner on the goalie

935
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
Can a 1in

936
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,871
No goalie deflection tool

937
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Bounce Jeddah

938
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Solid steel shot

939
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
There was just for this moment of this black

940
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,599
Laughter from the players being waited to be interviewed laughter from the media downstairs

941
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
Unbridled Joy of watching it all happen

942
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,023
I was just like as it's even happening like it I started to just be like

943
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Cuz I think I could

944
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Physically

945
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Adidas Milan

946
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
Stan

947
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,007
The guys on the ice jumped on me they're like holy cow this is unbelievable

948
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
The Final Chapter

949
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Of the John Scott story

950
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
At least as it pertains to the all-star game

951
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Is

952
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Really beautiful thing

953
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
And so

954
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
So there's this scene in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan

955
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
I swear

956
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
It looks like

957
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
The Enterprise is going to get away

958
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Having defeated car

959
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Pecan

960
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Young

961
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
Still alive

962
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,991
He's going to try to trigger the doomsday device on a ship

963
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Kill Everybody

964
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,135
It's so as as as as their prizes

965
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Is flying away you see a blood conse

966
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
From hell's heart

967
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Hell's heart I stab at thee

968
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,335
And I thought of that scene when the

969
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,175
Voting for most valuable player at the All-Star game start

970
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
To explain

971
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,087
At the end of the game there's one final bit

972
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
The fan voting

973
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,439
Fans were going to choose the MVP of the NHL All-Star Game

974
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,303
Most Valuable Player and the fans in the arena and watching on TV

975
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,863
They would text the name of the person they want

976
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,959
Do a number or they would go on Twitter and use the special hashtags

977
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Text first

978
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Ndk

979
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,335
It will be coming up shortly write as a voting

980
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,431
Is about to begin up a bunch of names of players

981
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
On the jumbo

982
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,319
Here are your choice and John Scott name was not listed

983
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,879
Among the three MVP candidates

984
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
On the Jumbotron

985
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:31,423
All Star MVP award

986
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
The fan saw that I wasn't on there they went not they started the boo

987
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Loudly

988
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Visibly

989
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
You know feel it

990
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
Around the ring

991
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
I thought it was the last gasp

992
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,111
Of all the people at the NHL that tried to keep

993
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,695
John Scott out of the All-Star game that was their last chance

994
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
To get them

995
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Like Khan

996
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Trying to get

997
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Captain Kirk that's

998
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Trying to say with the NL

999
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Anyway

1000
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
What ended up happening is that during the voting

1001
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Thousands of people

1002
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
Road in their own show

1003
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
And when it was announced

1004
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
The 2016 NHL All-Star MVP Sports

1005
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,495
It's funny I didn't hear it because on Ice level you don't hear what speakers are playing because

1006
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,335
They they point the speakers to the fan sliding head here until like

1007
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,175
Somebody's like a like going like a choking hazard weird

1008
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
John Gates out to the center of the ice

1009
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:53,599
Laughing looking a little scared boy should I was just like the MVP of the All-Star Game

1010
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
John Scott is with the air

1011
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
There's been all kinds of motivations for you

1012
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:05,119
What do you want to say first offense

1013
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,239
Thank you so much you guys are just thank you so much

1014
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
And in what was

1015
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
V

1016
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
Teary-eyed

1017
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:24,063
Disney Family Sports still moment

1018
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,647
Let's go to me and then they're going to

1019
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:32,255
He was wasted on to the shoulders of his teammates

1020
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
And paraded around like he was Rudy

1021
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:41,471
Greatest sports movie ever

1022
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,439
I wanted to go down by

1023
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,743
The ice so that the kids could see John and

1024
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
Keep for trying to help me down the stairs like parting the sea so I could get down there

1025
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,543
And it was so weird like it was literally like Disney wrote a script and said okay now he kisses his wife

1026
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:22,943
You took me in her eyes locked and it was just we both are kind of like shaking your head like we're both a little bit

1027
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Beast Boy

1028
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Now he grabbed

1029
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Kiss

1030
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Scoop them up

1031
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
Cliche fashion I grab my kids

1032
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,879
Scale

1033
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
You think you smell bad in

1034
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
Like every time

1035
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,559
Like I would just look at him and I can't even believe this is happening and it was no

1036
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
Like I just can't

1037
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,703
And if it came off the ice there were crowds of people waiting asking questions

1038
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,543
Pictures with. But we had to fight the next morning at like 5 a.m.

1039
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
He had to get back to the minor leagues

1040
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
And before that

1041
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,687
They still had to have these babies

1042
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
City Russian to give birth to the twins

1043
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
4 days after babies were born and went back to St John's

1044
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
My God

1045
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Yeah

1046
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,279
I feel like that was really the beginning of

1047
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,559
The rest of our lives

1048
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,911
John finish out that season

1049
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
Play one last NHL game

1050
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
And then retired

1051
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,823
And Danielle live with their five girls in Traverse City Michigan

1052
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Butts

1053
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
The Legacy

1054
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Arby's All-Star appearance

1055
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Lived on in two ways

1056
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
First

1057
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,879
The day after the game it was announced that John Scott's helmet-to-helmet he wore during the game

1058
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
Would be flown to Toronto

1059
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
Where will be put on display

1060
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255

00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
He Hall of Fame

1062
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,631
But the other thing that happened was just in time for the next year's All-Star Game

1063
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
The NHL created a new rule

1064
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
Known as the John Scott rule

1065
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,591
Which states that any player who is voted to be a captain in the All-Star Game

1066
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,895
Then gets demoted to the minor leagues

1067
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,967
Will be disqualified will not be allowed to play

1068
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503

00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063

1070
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
