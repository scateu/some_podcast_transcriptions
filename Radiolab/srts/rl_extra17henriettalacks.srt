1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Kate this is Chad

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,840
Just wanted to throw it in extra episode indoor

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
Murphy dandanah from movie that we're really

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,656
It about

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
But first

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
Couple weeks ago I

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:17,152
I stepped in here and I laid out a challenge grant that we've gotten from the how Foundation

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
The deal was if you remember

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
That is 700 of you guys listening step forward agreed to kick in $7 a month to support them

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,440
Making Radiolab then the towel Foundation would give us 70 Grant

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
Help make the show

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
So again

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
700 people

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Decide to donate $7 a month we get 70 grand that was the deal all right so how do we do it

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
How did you do you crushed it just

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
Rushed it okay we needed 700 people

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
As of right now I think we're at somewhere over 3,000 you did so well we did so well

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
The Thao Foundation just came back to us an up the ante full-on stretch goal because here's the thing

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
3000 people is amazing but that is just percentage of the people who actually listen to the spot

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
So they're thinking is let's capitalize on this momentum get the other 99.9% involved

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
So their new stretch goal is it they have agreed to match any donation that comes to Radiolab

22
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,760
Right now up to 10 grand so if you decide to make the seven bucks a month

23
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Deal that becomes $14 a month if you decide to do a one-time donation 60 bucks

24
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,744
That's not 120 tile will match it and this

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Reminder this is how we're able to do you know the year-long investigation in the police shooting or the

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
Nuclear chain of command the name last three that we've done this is how we pay for it

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
And this challenge Grant will allow us to go farther

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
So if you're down go to radiolab.org match

29
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Or you can text

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
The word match

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
To the number 69866

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
Getting texts the word match the number 69866

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,768
Little formal pop up and you can donate in a matter of seconds and thank you

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Alright so tonight

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Is

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
The premiere of a movie we're really excited about

37
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
It's called The Immortal Life

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Of Henrietta Lacks

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Stars

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,504
A&M homecoming actress maybe you've heard her Oprah Winfrey

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,368
And it is based on the book of a very very dear friend Rebecca

42
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Skloot best-selling book

43
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
You will watch this

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,560
The movie in a couple days on HBO but in the meantime we're just so proud of Rebecca

45
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,400
Thrilled that this movie is getting out to a wider audience

46
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Everyone should know

47
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
So none of that

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,592
We're going to play for you a document to reproduce with Rebecca we worked on it for a few years with her while

49
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
She was sort of formulating the book

50
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Includes tape you won't hear anywhere else

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Will you move me closer

52
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
And the story

53
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Is about a tumor that expands

54
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
I never stops

55
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,672
Begin to 1950 a black woman in Baltimore

56
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Is in her bathroom

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,536
And she discovers pretty much all on her own

58
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
Did she has cancer

59
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
It's all it's all a bit of a mystery how she initially knew this but she knew it was there

60
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Not she called it she

61
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,176
Had told her cousins for a while that she thought there was something

62
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Wrong with her

63
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
With her womb

64
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
And she climbed in her bathtub

65
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
And she

66
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Put her fingers up inside of herself

67
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
And found this lump chapter 1

68
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
Interlocal doctor

69
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
I happen to be an attending at that time the guys she eventually ended up seeing

70
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Johns Hopkins University

71
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,776
Was this fellow doctor Howard Jones

72
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,128
Wow what you came in to see you can you tell me anything about what you would like

73
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
Well she was a

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
You don't remember anything I really don't

75
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
But you remember her tumor right anything like it before or after

76
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
It doesn't look like a normal tumor it was it was deep purple and a quarter

77
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
Slightly raised

78
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
I think it was red Jello there is something very strange about the way I look

79
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
So doctors took a sample

80
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
These little teeny tiny pieces

81
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,719
Lab for diagnosis and in this case since it was Hawkins they would take an extra piece

82
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
And give it to

83
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Man named George guy

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
2

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
So George guy was a researcher who works at the Hop

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,775
You got a deal with the clinic at anytime they got a patient with cervical cancer they give him a tiny piece

87
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
If the tumor

88
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
What he really wanted to do his main mission

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
She noticed his scientists everywhere we

90
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
They wanted to find a way

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
To grow human cells

92
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Outside of human

93
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
In a dish

94
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
George guy had been trying to do this

95
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Working on this project

96
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
And why exactly

97
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,327
It's sort of like it's her like having a little tiny bit of a person in it in a lab that

98
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Detached from them so that you can do whatever you want with them

99
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
You know you can't

100
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Bombard some person with a bunch of drugs into

101
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Wait to see how much they can tolerate before their cells all explode

102
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
But you can do that in cell culture

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
You're so this is like

104
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,247
This is like the basic thing you need to study human biology you need cells in a dish yes

105
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Rimowa

106
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
Anytime they tried to grow human cells in a dish

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
I would die

108
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Yeah

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
They died

110
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
This is George guy's former lab assist

111
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Can you just tell me your name mean

112
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
My name is Mary

113
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
I'll put my maiden name in there

114
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Troy kubicek

115
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,127
Mary lives just outside of Baltimore about an hour from where she used to work with George guy such as

116
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
Show me some pictures and he's sitting at

117
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Atom microscope

118
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
So I can have you back

119
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
He said he seems like a really big guy like

120
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
At least six five judging the picture

121
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,487
And then every slide that you showed me he had kind of a crazy smile on his face

122
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
A man is what I always

123
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,703
Mary says they were completely stumped at why the human cells always die

124
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
But they just did

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,663
On the day that George guy walked in and married to with a little chunk of a nameless woman cervical cancer inside

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,527
No one expected anything while he was doing that well he probably

127
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Everhope

128
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
But

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,463
I was eating lunch now that you know it's not going to grow I'm going to finish this sandwich

130
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
That's what I did

131
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
No I went in and

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Cheapest house in food

133
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Turn on all the machines and left

134
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Came back the next day

135
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Bandai

136
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
So she came back the next day

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
They were growing

138
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
And the next day

139
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
Still growing they just kept plugging along

140
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
In the net group

141
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
A lot

142
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,367
Becca says they doubled in size every 24 hours

143
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
They just grew all of a sudden you know I care

144
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Transferring them

145
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Making more

146
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
YouTube transferring them

147
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Making mortar tubes

148
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
They were very reliable and stronger they just kept plugging along

149
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Dark Knight

150
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Officially she died of

151
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Uremia witches

152
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
Like toxicity of the blood because she wasn't able to get rid of the toxic waste that

153
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Usually goes out in your urine

154
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Not herself

155
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
And tell us this story

156
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,695
Is a privilege to introduce dr. George guy with long after that George guy appeared on TV

157
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
Holding in his hand a little bottle

158
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Like an alarm which we have grown

159
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Quantity of cancer

160
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,775
Did you want to look at the photos and uplifting

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Until you go to the Hopkins archives and look up

162
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
George guys pictures and videos

163
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Okay this is

164
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,527
Phone can hear your cell phone then it hits you

165
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Omigod swirling hurricanes of cells just like thousands of little pot

166
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,279
Some small and some very large

167
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
Make a note to leave them under the microscope

168
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
It's indescribable

169
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Why hers

170
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Just sort of took off and grew and the other ones

171
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,623
The day of tried before didn't is just a little bit of a mystery nobody really knows

172
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
For unless George gynuity had

173
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Disney cell line

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
What's what they'd all been waiting for

175
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
So early on

176
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Right after this one died George guy sent Mary

177
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Back down

178
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
Get more cancer cells from the court to the morgue yeah

179
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Really

180
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
So I went down there

181
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
And they are

182
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Corner I don't know

183
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Dr. Garg

184
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Pair to anywhere standing

185
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Danaher

186
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Feet sore

187
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Meanwhile she's

188
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
It's like she was flying out there she's already open

189
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
I got some samples

190
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Cornell Tech

191
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
What you look like

192
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
I could look at her face

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
I couldn't look at her

194
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
The only thing I looked at where her toes and they had chips

195
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Nail polish

196
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
What was it about the nail

197
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Oh cuz it was chipped

198
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,783
Cuz you know that she hadn't been able to take care of her nails grow long

199
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Time if they got

200
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Like that

201
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
And it's show that she was proud of her so

202
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Not everyone wears

203
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Nail polish

204
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Post

205
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Over the next several months

206
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
Well this woman's body lady composing the ground

207
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
George guy in Mary produce

208
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Hundreds of thousands of

209
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Versailles

210
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Are tumor cells and he named them

211
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
The Hela strain

212
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Hela

213
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,199
Like hela hela no one would actually know why you named them that for about

214
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Two decades but what he did with these cells

215
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
You know we would be unusual nowadays

216
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,439
It's like if somebody now found a cell that was special they run off to the patent office and then sell it to Merck

217
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Fredonia books

218
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
Hey just passing out freely in trying to make any money off

219
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
Nice nice

220
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
New things

221
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Could help science

222
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
Mary says it George guy begin to send hila all over the world

223
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
Pretty soon she was in hundreds of labs

224
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
And this was in the midst of the polio epidemic

225
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,343
1951-52 you know schools are being closed kids are being kept inside

226
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Enormous effort to develop polio vaccine

227
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,327
Problem was in order to develop a vaccine you had to have enough

228
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Poliovirus

229
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Univ quantity to be able to study in the lab

230
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
And I had no way of making enough

231
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
So what are you doing well

232
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
One of the guys

233
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Guy

234
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
One of the guys the guy had sent

235
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
DSL still your friend of guys discovered something

236
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Kind of amazing

237
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Which is it polio

238
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Loved the hela cell put polio inside a hela cell healing would copy and in the process make more polio

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Xerox El no matter what you want to do

240
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
Make a copy make a copy make it pop

241
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,535
Yeah so now that a way of making polio you that could just be a

242
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Polio Factory

243
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
And so

244
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
The government me to factory look at Tuskegee inst

245
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Ketut literally a factory said they had

246
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
He's big you know stainless steel if active culture medium that works for rotated constantly

247
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
Autoclave screw sterilizing other equipment Arroyo with snails

248
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Buy microscope

249
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
Crazy frankensteiners to give mode they had

250
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,975
Machine like an automatic pill dispenser and it had the surgery on arm

251
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
It's worth

252
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
A certain amount of

253
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
This culture medium filled with

254
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
Fuel cells into a tube of Industry

255
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Yeah it is absolutely the cells that were produced satisfactory she says were used to test the polio vaccine

256
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
The test

257
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
In North is the largest field trial ever done

258
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
At its peak

259
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
The Tuskegee

260
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Hila production Center

261
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Was producing. 6 trillion cells week

262
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Maui

263
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Kind of inconceivable

264
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,559
That was actually only the beginning such a backup because this Factory led to an even bigger one

265
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
It was for profit rate

266
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
That second Factory was the first

267
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Time

268
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
Any human biological material was commercial

269
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
To this was the first biotech

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
Basically when they first started mass-producing

271
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
What sort of things were done to the

272
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Problems

273
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Investigate

274
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Click anything you can imagine

275
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Do they infected Hela cells with every kind of virus

276
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Titus

277
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Equine Encephalitis virus yellow fever herpes measles mumps rabies whatever like you just any

278
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
And this was just

279
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,703
This is a revolution for scientific research on chemotherapy drugs Hela cells went up into the first

280
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Space mission

281
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Really

282
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
Yes if they were Hela when to spay Louis and to say such a every time I hear that you're like

283
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
Why I mean

284
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Because the premise was

285
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
To see what happens to human cells

286
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,671
In zero gravity to know if we're going to be sending people up into space what's going to happen to them up there

287
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Inhumans dead

288
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Sheetz

289
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
The Fells

290
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
What's actually skip forward in the story to the point where that

291
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
The Flipper

292
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
We just heard that pronoun confusion

293
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Gets

294
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Personal

295
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Know what would happen

296
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Okay the late 60s

297
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
Revolution in science and now there are hundreds of cell lines not just he livid

298
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Hundreds

299
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Somewhere along the way

300
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Scientist discovered that

301
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,327
Sheila is so aggressive that she's actually been contaminating and taking over

302
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
All these other cell lines

303
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
What you just said she

304
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
But I get your point

305
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
And she doesn't know

306
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
It

307
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Does it in The Stranger

308
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
Just way he was elves can you know they can float on desk

309
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
We can ride I can what

310
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
They can float on Dust particles

311
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
Yes so they can they can hop out of addition to

312
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Get on a particle and

313
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Out the door

314
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Stairs down the hall and he'll self to allow drops into into dish cell culture where there's other cells growing

315
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
And because he will sell their sort of powerful

316
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Salisbury

317
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Take over

318
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
So on the heels of this catastrophe someone at Hopkins decides

319
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
To make a test

320
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Let's make a test

321
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,831
It will allow us to genetically determine if a cell is Gila or if it is

322
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
How to make a long story short

323
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
This desire for a genetic test

324
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
Lead scientist II Men journalist

325
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,815
To ask a question which amazingly for 25 years had not been asked

326
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Who was this woman

327
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
And that's when we found out her name

328
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Henrietta

329
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Lacks

330
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
This is the sound of Rebecca reading henrietta's medical Rec

331
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
First time

332
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Can I have this

333
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,831
Is a 30 year old colored woman

334
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
She sitting with

335
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
Henrietta's youngest daughter Deborah

336
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
2nd of November to this is again

337
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Just bring it with you

338
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,815
Henrietta had five kids when she died at the age of 31

339
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Most have no memory of

340
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Especially true of Deborah

341
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
Was only 15 months old and I don't

342
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
Remember anything about my mother

343
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Yes she

344
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
You know she

345
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
She gets in her entire life

346
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Just a Longing To Know

347
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Her mother was and did she lie

348
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
Dancing and I always wanted to know what she

349
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Like to do what she

350
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
When

351
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
Would you like to eat that you breastfeed Deborah she was she was really sort of

352
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
I was fixated on that idea she wanted to know

353
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
If she was breastfed

354
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
I don't know what I would give up just to

355
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Just

356
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Half a hair tie

357
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
It's a see her

358
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Homework

359
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
So in 1973

360
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,103
When a scientist calls the lacks family never hears

361
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
That little bit

362
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
Of the mother that she never knew are still alive

363
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,367
And oh by the way can we take a blood test from your family's or having some contamination problem when you do genetic marker

364
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
Blah blah blah what is you could imagine

365
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
Took me by surprise it really did

366
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
It was really confusing I mean how much is it how much of a sales is out there you know eventually she went online

367
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
I found thousands and thousands of hits

368
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
Like for instance on HELOC loans

369
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
And Deborah had heard

370
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
And various journalists

371
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
In the past to come to her and mentioned you know

372
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Dolly the cloned sheep

373
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
End

374
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Dad you know your mom

375
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
They did this with your mom to meaning that's actually where the technology started

376
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
The first cells ever cloned were Hela cells

377
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
But that was just clone yourself

378
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Not cloning an entire being

379
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
But that

380
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Distinction

381
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Is very complicated

382
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
For somebody who doesn't know what a cell is

383
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Between what

384
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
Journalists I told her and Googling

385
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Can relax and clone thought there were thousands of

386
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
Cloned her mother around and

387
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
You mean like a bunch of Henrietta

388
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Walking Street walking around

389
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
Rebecca says that one of Deborah's biggest fears

390
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
Is bumping into one of these clones

391
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
You know she would say I would have to go talk to her and she wouldn't know that I was

392
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Daughter and

393
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
And and I don't know that I

394
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Handle that

395
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Wow sound so fantastically how could someone believe that they're copies of her mother walking around but at 1.25

396
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,791
5 years after their mother died someone called and said hey

397
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,887
Piper still alive and you know we've got enough of her so that they could wrap around the Earth

398
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,727
Travel time to Des Moines all bets are off

399
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
Not to mention that it's actually not that crazy

400
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Is your DNA is in yourself

401
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
So if your cells are taken out of you and they still grow

402
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
What is Nats w

403
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,159
Alive of you but it's clearly not you and it's going on and on that some

404
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
It's a funny middle space that's for sure

405
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,631
So here's what happened is Rebecca went off in search of Henrietta Lacks

406
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
Every so often Deborah would come along

407
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
And sit with her as they interviewed you know anyone that could find friends family and eventually over many many

408
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Years

409
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Picture does emerge

410
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
This woman was she was born in in Roanoke 1920 Virginia

411
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
10th

412
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,279
Of the 11 children but at least she was the one that stood out everybody talked about her as just being

413
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,143
You know she was the catch oh my goodness I don't think I could stop her

414
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,239
This is Sadie Sturdivant henrietta's cousin

415
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Did it for myself but it was very

416
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,663
Brown eyes brown hair

417
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
Snake tan complexion

418
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Everyone they spoke with zeroed in on the same few points

419
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
First she was really

420
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Meticulous about her nails

421
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Always has very deep red and second Henrietta just had this she was very strange

422
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Forthright

423
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
MicroCell

424
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
Unfortunate thing is it when it comes to her life

425
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
And how she lived

426
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
There's not a ton of detail

427
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
So this is when

428
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
But in that hotel room

429
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Flipping through the medical record

430
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
They did start to get some detail

431
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
The Hedgehog

432
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Write about

433
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
How she died

434
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
Wishing a lot of pain when she died this was the hardest thing

435
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
She was eventually in an unbelievable amount of pain

436
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Complains of pain

437
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
In the right lower quadrant wailing and

438
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,263
And crying and you know moaning for the Lord to help her and

439
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
According to the records doctors tried everything morphine they injected

440
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Gibson alcohol straight into her spine

441
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Pain

442
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Spider the alcohol

443
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Injection last week to have these fits of Team through spasms

444
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
Waves of pain would hit her and she would rise up out of the bed and brush around

445
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
The bass Tracker to the bed and

446
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
Her sister

447
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Along with one of her friends

448
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
In one of them would tighten the straps and the other one would put a pillow in her mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue

449
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
If I just had the chance

450
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
To take care of

451
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Now

452
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
Dealing with how her mother died was one thing

453
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Cells

454
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Made it more complicated

455
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Whatever her mother was alive and he sells them how

456
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
So if that's true that

457
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,304
Left very big questions and the first of them

458
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
For Deborah was how can

459
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
I'd rather rest in peace If part of her with part of her soul is being in a shot up to the moon and injected with l

460
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
Chemicals in a radiated and bombarded it so painful

461
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
No one you know that

462
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Had her sales on

463
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,712
The backward donkey going to Turkey

464
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
You know in the airplane

465
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Just born all over the world

466
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,208
I just don't know if she worried about them

467
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
She worried that it hurt

468
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Your mother

469
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
The cells with Ebola

470
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Does somehow her mother feel

471
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,704
The pain that comes with ebola and had a scientist ever like sat down with her

472
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
Me just explain to her like this is no never

473
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,688
Nothing cuz it's you that wouldn't be that hard to explain it like

474
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
When you take cells out of a body it's kind of like when you cut your fingernail

475
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,624
Off it just doesn't that your fingernail doesn't keep growing and living after you cut it off

476
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
It's a it's really hard there is no other example of

477
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Some way that you can take something from someone's body

478
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
And have it keep living and not have a person feel it

479
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
And all these worries sister Baga

480
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Began to build and Deborah's mind

481
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
And Dill

482
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,824
And Bill

483
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
At her cousin's house

484
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Other cousin Gary

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
Tooth broken out in hives

486
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,552
She was telling him all the stuff that she recently learned can almost hear it on the tape she says to him

487
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
Can't carry the burden of these cells anymore

488
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Do it

489
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
I don't want to try to do

490
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
And I have been started trying to talk her down and he was trying to talk her down

491
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,936
And then just out of nowhere he just started

492
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Singing

493
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,560
And he started preaching

494
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,448
He held her head in his hands

495
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
About Buffet

496
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Thank you for being awake

497
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
You make a pass in the mail

498
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:51,296
You called the mountains skip like lambs

499
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Thank you Lord

500
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Thank you

501
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Thank you Lord

502
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Thank you

503
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Thank you

504
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Thank you Jesus

505
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Hallelujah

506
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Hurry up

507
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Hey man

508
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Batman

509
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
And she just

510
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Feel like a man

511
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
I feel like

512
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
She didn't realize it then

513
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
That night

514
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
Deborah was on the verge of a stroke

515
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,912
One of the most striking moments of the stories when the two of them visit Hoskins

516
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
And

517
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
Debra meets her mother's cells for the first time

518
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
The scientist finally contacted

519
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,296
Christoph lengauer the scientist to invite us into his lab to see the cells

520
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:02,208
He had projected them onto a screen

521
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
Appliques cuz the way they were stained and protected

522
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
So they're very it's cereal looking they're very assertive there they glow you know I mean when you think about angel

523
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,592
Filtrate you think of something glowing Christopher turned on the screen and she just

524
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Xiamen Deborah gist

525
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:25,504
Gas

526
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
200 times bigger than what they really are

527
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Chain of cells

528
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,104
Kristoff gave the he gave her a vial of the cells that you can hold in her hand

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
And it came out of the freezer so they're cold and she sort of her hands together with the

530
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
Violin her hands or warm them up in

531
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Blue on them to keep them warm

532
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
And then she just threw whispered to the cells it was

533
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,768
Incredible sheep just raise them up to her lips and she said

534
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
You famous

535
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Nobody knows

536
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
Just a week before Rebecca and I spoke in the studio she got

537
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,064
Got a call that Deborah had died she had a heart attack and died in her sleep

538
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Okay so

539
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
As you may know at this point

540
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
That segment was based on Rebecca

541
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
Exclusive book The Immortal Life of

542
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Henrietta Lacks

543
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
Amazing book

544
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
It cannot

545
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Right when we released at

546
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Hispanic

547
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Couple years now

548
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
And recently we met up with

549
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Rebecca inch

550
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Chicago

551
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,512
Just get an update came out of that but

552
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Twitter just took off

553
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
Scholarships for named after Henrietta

554
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Honorary doctorate monuments Highway placards and historical landmarks and buildings named after

555
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
High school called Henrietta Lacks High

556
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
Hela high for short B while the book is it

557
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Exploding she went on this like insane book tour members of the lacks family began to join her and started off with just

558
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Relax would go in

559
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
User on stage

560
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
It's Q&A

561
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
And people started cheering

562
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
And scientist ending up saying

563
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,328
I want to tell you what I did with these cells and I want to tell you why this was important for me and I'm sorry it was hard for you and

564
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
People reaching out I'm alive today because of this a drug that your mother sells help that Oliver

565
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
You know I do this in my lab and they just it never stop

566
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,616
The flood which is an away with Deborah always wanted she wanted to go

567
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,992
To every event she wanted to be on every television show she had her dress picked out for Oprah like

568
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,576
You know 8 years for the book came out you know she was

569
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Deborah wanted this is

570
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Exactly what she always do

571
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
But then

572
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Just last year

573
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Something interesting

574
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,864
Troubling so yeah so March 2013 to 3% is from Germany sequence

575
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
The original in Publisher online

576
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Where anyone can download at

577
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
Please click button I downloaded it was is there

578
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,872
And they did not ask the family and my initial reaction when I saw this press coverage was

579
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
They did what

580
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Because

581
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Within the Hela genome

582
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
There's also

583
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
And some of that

584
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
Was Pat 50% kids in 25%

585
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Potentially to her grandkids

586
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:48,768
But one of the things so they put out a press release when this genome sequencing on it had a little

587
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,072
Frequently asked questions of the press might

588
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
And one of them was

589
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:59,008
Can you learn anything about Henrietta or her or her children from this you know the answer is no.

590
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,056
And I do and I believe that they

591
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
But they believe

592
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,968
But this is a misconception you can in fact learn about people and in fact you cannot even hide

593
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,040
People's private information if you try and so

594
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
1

595
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Researcher

596
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
Took the genome and created

597
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Essentially

598
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
A report on Henrietta

599
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
You have

600
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
X percent chance of

601
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
Bipolar disorder

602
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,704
Alcoholism obesity has this huge range of things and

603
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Some of it is yes there's some real

604
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Potential privacy violation like with the Alzheimer's jeans and things like that bit of information about your family

605
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Will not tell you

606
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,736
Was it support this dude

607
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
May did he

608
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,856
List all these things are describing to me

609
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
So I called The Lacs

610
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
Did you know that

611
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
Let me think about this and Rebecca head cold you know

612
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
They did not

613
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,864
Any kind of bothered us because we're saying okay

614
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
Why wasn't a family involved with this decision maker

615
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,752
That was Jerry lacks Gary Lacks

616
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Y.

617
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,872
Laxus granddaughter back in the 50s you had Henrietta Lacks

618
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
Versailles weather

619
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
Removed without her family's knowledge

620
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
Can you go in the 70s

621
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,832
My dad and his siblings

622
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
Mito blood samples

623
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Used it for research

624
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
They didn't give consent

625
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
Then you come 2013

626
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
And you have

627
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Henrietta's

628
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,656
That's out this though it was her medical records being

629
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Published publicly

630
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
Another first question was

631
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Can you get them to take it down

632
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,080
Until we can figure out what it is what it means

633
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
So I reach out to the scientist and said

634
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Black family you know

635
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
They replied immediately they took it offline

636
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Immediately

637
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
And then I contacted Francis Collins

638
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,184
The head of the NIH I also reached out to

639
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Kathy Hudson who

640
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:01,120
Used to run the genetics and public policy Center at Hopkins and is now over at the NH dealing with a lot of these issues

641
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Shout to them

642
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
And said somebody needs to try to

643
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
Help black men get consent to me need to just

644
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Go back

645
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Pretend like this is starting

646
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Now

647
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
And just do it probably should have happened in the first place and that's a might have been like a couple of weeks after that several weeks after that

648
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
That they had a meeting with NIH

649
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,904
That was my mom myself my sister my dad my uncle My Brother David

650
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
My cousin Ron Rebecca skloot she was asking or not

651
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Conference call

652
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
All the nhbooks drive up to Baltimore

653
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
Doctor College Kathy I sending it was like we were excited like

654
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
With the director they all met

655
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Listen to everybody you know

656
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Listen to all

657
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Cassandra listen to all quiet

658
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
What can be done what can be done

659
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,832
The last time we asked about everything you could possibly imagine when over you know

660
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
The information about Geno

661
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:00,000
Gene sequencing the basic science of genomes to get a clear understanding of

662
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
What DG No Limit

663
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Defiance

664
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
We all want to stop science

665
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
But yet we don't want

666
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Certain information to be just broadly available

667
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Publicly so they laid out three options one was we don't release any of them at all and then there was a second option which was released

668
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Sit with

669
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
No restriction

670
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
Just put it out there like the Germans did

671
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,552
And then there was corruption which was really sit with restrictions

672
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,344
Dover NH wood house it

673
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
On their own servers

674
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,792
And that in order to get access to it you would have to send an application at said this is the research we're going to do that would be

675
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
The committee formed that was a group of scientist

676
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
And then some members Alexa

677
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
The Hela genome

678
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
Committee one grandson child and one great-grandchild My Brother David and my cousin Veronica and this is the option

679
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
So yeah there's this company and they just

680
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
A few weeks ago

681
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Saw their first batch of applications

682
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,600
In the news hit and it was the first time that they were part of the news

683
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,416
Sole the third generation

684
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
Like Jerry lacks was on

685
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,280
MSNBC Live doing an interview about this

686
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,168
She never done this before and they were in every newspaper and it was

687
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
Everywhere is pretty exciting and we are stepping into the spotlight is it's the grandchildren

688
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
Third and fourth generation blacks

689
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
16 great-grandchildren is there snow right now and that's

690
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah the other thing that is an undercurrent for all this is Deborah's gone

691
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,320
She was the one who was

692
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Just so forceful

693
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
And so dedicated with

694
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Getting

695
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:37,024
The information out there about her mom and you know what I look at

696
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
The four years since the book came out

697
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
Yeah there a few moments

698
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,424
The standout is incredibly emotional

699
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
This

700
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
The first meeting

701
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Sitting on the

702
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Speakerphone

703
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Listening to

704
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
This

705
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,968
Meeting these high officials sitting at the table and and have

706
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
Sincere concern about

707
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Alquest

708
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,392
If she could have said what what do I dream might someday happen

709
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
That would be what she would have described how I've been I can just imagine her just sitting there and she just laughing rocking back and

710
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,888
Twiddling fingers

711
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Absorbing all of this

712
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
This excitement

713
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
I want to thank Rebecca skloot for giving us her rot Apes her book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is true

714
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Truly spellbinding

715
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,400
