1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you awake

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,800
Radiolab

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,664
From WNYC

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
And NPR hey I'm Chatham run this is Radiolab

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Cast and

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
I'm usually want to do today

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,232
You know what we just did the hour-long show about the

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Ghost

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
And in the middle of that show hit on this idea that there are so many of us on the planet now doing so many different things

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,240
Which affect the air and the water that the creatures on the planet

11
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,800
Can no longer really

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
Uninfluenced by our presence

13
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
Truly Wild

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,248
That made me wonder will

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
If you want to give the other creatures on earth a little more

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Groom-to-be

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
Be wild and independent than what do we have to give

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
How much are we willing

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
To give up to make IHOP

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
I don't know these are

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Tough question

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I mean you know when I get it the answer part right so this is John moala I'm John

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
I read a book called wild ones and I'm a writer with the New York Times magazine

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
And being a writer he told me a story

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,272
This is a story would shed some light on this question but I think it's

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Sated

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Difficult

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,160
So there was a family of whooping cranes that

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
Had been part of the story revolves around a project

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Create a wild

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Flock of whooping

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
One of the most spectacular birds in the world 5 foot tall is pitch white thing with black wingtips going to 7 Foot

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Wingspan beautiful Flyers is Joe Duff I'm the co-founder of operation migration the currency

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,480
Now we've done it story of operation migration before and Radiolab but here's the here's the gist

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,320
At one point the whooping crane population in North America was down to like

36
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
15 bird

37
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
One flock

38
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
SoJO with a bunch of other folks decided to see if they could start anew

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Flock of crows

40
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,096
So they raise some cranes in Wisconsin and then they teach them

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
A new migration route

42
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Florida

43
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
By leaving there

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,824
In ultralight airplane Joe in addition to being founder and CEO is also the lead pile

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
How long have you been you been doing this for a while

46
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
I started flying with birds in 93

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
20 years and the key to this whole project

48
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Joe says

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,344
Is to eliminate all things human

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
These are wild creatures you know we do this whole thing in full costume so the birds

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Don't hear voices they don't touch

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
I don't see buildings or any other human paraphernalia in order to

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
Maintain their Wild

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
Still even wears an all white

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Crane-like costume when he's up there in the ultra

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Feeding the birds

57
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Come to Florida

58
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
And when they get the flu

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
Florida crane they're supposed to know they're brought to this some chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge it's a coastal wetland

60
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832
And it's all a salt marsh in the Tampa area and the birds are put into Squad release Panda Tennessee

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,696
12 foot high fence is protected by electric wire but the whole complex is not talking at it

62
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
And so on

63
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
After a while the birds realize they can fly out then they go seek

64
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
Shout their own territories

65
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
It's called a gentle release Into the Wild

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Or

67
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
The Nights Watch

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
And here's where the problem starts it's the winter of 2007 and we got a particular bunch of cranes this

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Family they were called the first family cuz they were the first trains in the population to have a have a chick that they LED South

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
Wild hatch migratory whooping crane in the US since the last Nest was reported in 1878

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,072
These cranes head wound up in on this little subdivision Wetland complex that was surrounded by houses

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,656
It was perfect crane habitat it was it was basically a March

73
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Just so happened that it was in this

74
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
This one is backyard

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,336
And so the birds which had been the product of this

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
You know very intensive effort and tons of money hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour to be wild whooping cranes were now just

77
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:10,624
In our backyard and there was there was free food there she had all these bird feeders whole array of different bird feeders

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,464
Aprender yard and that's not good sign why the why is this a problem

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Well the problem is we're worried that the birds are going to become acclimated to people to be really safe Joseph these bridge should be

80
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
Freedpeople 6mm have been shot

81
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Hmmm by Vandals

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
636 whooping cranes have been shot

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
In this project by vandals a so what are you doing we asked people to

84
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Stop timer

85
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Feeling with jellicoe a reverse phone directory awake give us

86
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
So we tracked the birds are not tracked I said they knew exactly where they where they were and they were able to figure out that the cranes work

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
In the backyard of

88
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Someone named

89
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Gibbs

90
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Clarisse Clarisse

91
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Yes Clarice Gibbs

92
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
And you know they knocked on our door in and explains you know the whole engine out to the project and would you please take your

93
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Bird feeders down

94
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
And she said she said no

95
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
No yeah

96
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
Why don't you say no

97
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Well done tok

98
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
The people who went to see her and I didn't say crazy but you got the sense that there was this you know crazy old bird lady lived in this house with wooden

99
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
Not take her feeders down thought you was acting kind of your attic and things just keep getting worse

100
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Words

101
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Gone in and put a plastic fence around one of her feeders at 1 playing with it what she thought she had given permission but she had no memory of that

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
It got it got better pretty fast and so John decided

103
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,823
Self for a you know crazy old bird lady who lived in this house

104
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
But I will but I went to go see her

105
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
And

106
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
You know it was a

107
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
How do I get taco time is it really

108
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
The emotional day for me

109
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:48,415
Massager under dining room table and she was having a lot of trouble remembering the exact chronology of what happened when

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Cheetah

111
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
You know she said excuse me I'm just hard for me to kind of

112
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Piece things together around that

113
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Toronto time

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
And and basically the story emerged

115
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Oh gosh

116
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,311
When we heard that story we decided we needed to talk to Clarice

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Cartels

118
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
So we called her up out of it

119
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Kind of the blue and asked if we could record the conversation

120
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Record we would love to do it

121
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
Well you know it wouldn't bother me at all I wouldn't mind

122
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
Louis hotels

123
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Surprising version of this Tale

And I'm here because I need your help

131
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
And I request

132
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

133
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

134
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
No did something

135
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
Kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

137
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,903
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

138
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

139
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

140
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
If you have a story please share it with us

We're back and we've just called up

146
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Clarice gif

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
No it wouldn't bother me at all I wouldn't mind okay

148
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
So you're about to say that you're

149
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Fishball the description you eat

150
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
How many

151
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
Bird feeders did you have in the backyard would you say rough

152
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
At that time

153
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
I think I had two or three in an oak tree that's here in our backyard and where we live

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
It's just

155
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,719
You know it's a peaceful area in birds like things like that they don't like to be alone around a lot of

156
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Congestion and stuffy nose

157
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
We enjoy them well I say we home

158
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,703
And my husband and his alive with you know we both enjoyed the birds and

159
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,591
This is where the story flip for me because when those conservationists were knocking at clarice's door

160
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Her husband

161
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
I'm more than 50 years

162
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
See hear all timers

163
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,295
They were sort of hunker down at their house waiting for his

164
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
Bree life to end

165
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,279
You know the Alzheimer's cooking really bad and what they were doing was spending a lot of time on their back porch

166
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
Looking at the birds we would come out here and

167
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,495
It was Artie or lemonade he would he would just kind of watch

168
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
Our back porch of course faces the lake

169
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
We have a beautiful yard we have oak trees

170
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,111
And as I'm sitting here talking to you there's all kinds of birds around right now feeding

171
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
We even have sandhill cranes that have to

172
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Babies with them

173
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
So the reason your husband would be there

174
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
On the porch and if you had this disease in your family

175
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,007
You know how painful it is because he is her husband

176
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
And he's just disappearing

177
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
A little bit

178
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
A little bit more

179
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
And then he's mostly not there

180
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
But when a bird

181
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Or a bunch of birds

182
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Come by the bird feeder

183
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
From wherever he was

184
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
He's back

185
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,767
As soon as he would spot something needs a baby there it is there's something bird

186
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
And when the whooping crane showed up

187
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Pekin

188
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
White

189
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Wild

190
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,983
And that would really get his attention cuz they are such big beautiful birds

191
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
You know I could see the

192
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,871
Oh gosh like I happiness in his eyes and

193
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
He would smile

194
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Oh

195
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,295
To me it was like you know he came back to me for a little bit when

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
When he would see things like this it would just

197
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,719
It would make him so happy and it would make me happy to to see

198
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
How it affected him

199
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
I'm sorry I just fight

200
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
I get a kind of choked up when I talk about him

201
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
We were married for 56 years then

202
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
That disease took him in

203
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
It was hard

204
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
From her point of view is like a miracle to see a bird like that

205
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,647
And in the way that our husband responded to them and just the other way they that they took his breath away

206
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
When really you know he wasn't responding to a

207
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
To a lot else in the world

208
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,607
You know when when they seem to recognize things and

209
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
And then you lose them again you know

210
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
So that's why when the crane people showed up at her door and said please take the bird feeder down

211
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
She said

212
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
No

213
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
You know I left that house

214
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,783
Just you know I just couldn't figure out how to make sense at all once it once it left

215
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Have the people who visited her

216
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,207
Having read your account have they changed their minds at all about

217
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Her or what they do because

218
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
It's a toughie

219
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Yeah I'm sure they would still believe that the bird shouldn't have been fed but I don't know if they would be any more sympathy

220
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,103
Her husband at least Bruce Ali and Ivar the trigger so I told Joe Ferguson story

221
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
So now what do you say

222
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
Well you know my father died of Alzheimer's so I can respect it exactly what she's going through and how different

223
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
It is however the cost of that is

224
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
The demise of a bird

225
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
That that

226
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Other people have spent a huge amount of time in 24 hours a day 7 days a week for that entire Birds license

227
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Let me see year old

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Putting in the wild

229
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
To help save a space but it but if you put yourself in her

230
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
Shoes she says

231
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
She by the way

232
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,943
Was very carefully I was very very emphatically

233
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
That we didn't

234
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Mess with the birds because

235
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,647
I knew they didn't want them being confronted with with people you know they

236
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
Because they are a wild thing and and

237
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Is it

238
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,119
Is it to me it is I don't know why we've always loved nature

239
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
We just always loved nature and

240
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
And Wildlife

241
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
She stayed where

242
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
What she felt

243
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
You'd want her to stay

244
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
But

245
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
It's a hard one

246
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
To ask the chi

247
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Give up

248
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
A glimpse at her husband

249
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
For the

250
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Sake of the bird

251
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Espo's

252
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
I'm a little more pragmatic than that unfortunately

253
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
You would want you would have him make an exception for her

254
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,703
Well at the very least I would have him cuz I understand but she's in a new unique

255
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Place that he's no I don't think it's Unique

256
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Well maybe she is in her particulars

257
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
But

258
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
That is precisely the problem he has to deal with it are people like her she means well we all mean well

259
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
It's not a case of like

260
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
People with guns shooting these birds I mean that does happen but I don't think that's the big problem now these are two people who both love the bird book

261
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
Can't agree on something right

262
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,815
And he sing in order to love the bird you have to negate

263
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,423
You have to just you have to disappear and we can't as human beings

264
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
We don't seem to be able to do that we all have our own personal

265
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,895
Requirements and we put those over and above anything else including wildlife and that's why

266
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Wildlife

267
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Is this

268
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Inside peril

269
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
He's asking her

270
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
To say goodbye to her husband for the sake

271
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Of

272
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
A bird species

273
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,071
How do I get to I just worry that if everybody in the world

274
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
Is like her than those birds don't have a chance

275
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,775
I would love it if these birds could just exist on their own somewhere and

276
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
Nnnnn in Deepwater marshes where they don't ever encounter people that's never going to happen

277
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Just not going to happen

278
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
And that's the struggle it's never going to go away you know no matter what

279
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
What happens if any of these species conservation project

280
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
We're not going to strike some balance wear

281
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
We never have to think about

282
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,583
The power that were exerting in the world this give-and-take. That's what it is

283
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
That's the endgame it's is that forever

284
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,391
