1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,296
Is Radiolab on Jad abumrad couple days ago Joe Frank passed away

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
One of the greats

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
Your business

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
Huge inspiration for me

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
But a guy his work you may not know

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
He was one of the originals

9
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
Nobody told stories like Joe Frank

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,168
Nobody tell stories like Joe Frank no one day he is still

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,008
You know what Imma do I want to take this podcast

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
To play for you a little bit of his work

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
It's so good

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
So good

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,224
Elsa play for you a few conversations I've had recently about

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,784
Joe Frank the impact of that work

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Starting with a

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
Conversation I had with Brooke Gladstone from on the media she recently interviewed me

19
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:07,072
About the impact that your hat on Radiolab which is significant so let's start there this is an excerpt

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,680
A conversation that I have Brooke Gladstone that they use for on the media and I believe

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Starts with clip

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
Let me play a clip

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
Or maybe a couple of them and get your reaction

24
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
You hug people goodbye after a social event

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Apsa dinner party

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Or gallery opening

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
There is always that moment

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
When they squeeze you more forcefully than before

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
A polite way of letting you know

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
They are about to withdraw

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Usually

32
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
The one who disengages first

33
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Is the one who cares less

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
This used to happen to me

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Dog rejected

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
I come home with a lonely sick feeling

37
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
That's why

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
Naughty to assume the power position

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
Game the psychological advantage

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Are people very briefly

41
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
22 seconds

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Before freeing myself

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Sometimes

44
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
Detect any resistance

45
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
I'll push the person away

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,408
I caused a woman to fall backwards over a chair and during their back

47
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
Sledge or hospitalization

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
But I had no choice

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
What's the matter

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
A self preservation

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
That is classic Joe Frank

52
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
It's really good writing you know he writes

53
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Scenarios

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
They're like demented Talk of the Town

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
Anyway later

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Little fragments of dark

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Experience which are beautifully realized very Vivid

58
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Kind of funny but kind of also struggling

59
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
How do you think

60
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
He

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Influenced you

62
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
You are always

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
A great producer always

64
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Technically adept

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
You had

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,768
Tons of musical composition training you understood the rhythmic possibilities of radio

67
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
What did he do that you

68
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Don't think you could have done without him

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
A lot of different things

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
This was way too beginning for me

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
Radiolab was just a 3-hour thing

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
On the AM station

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
We're going back home

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,968
We're going back to the Stone Age so January February 2002 somewhere around there

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Willie the beginning

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Everybody here who knows the beginning of Radiolab knows that I didn't deserve that show it was too soon I didn't know what I was do

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Doing it didn't have a style I had this

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
I had the unfortunate

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Thing that we all had back at you.

80
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
I said I would she wanted to be Ira Glass everybody

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
I want to be hourglass right

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
And I was still trying to figure out like a case of who am I what do I want my stuff to

83
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
The sound like

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
And so I would

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Every Sunday night

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
How to put a 3 hours and it was an anthology show at

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
And it was literally

88
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Take

89
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
The best documentaries from the BBC the CBC

90
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,088
In Canada the ABC in Australia radio Netherlands all the stuff

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
And

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Package them into

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
3 continuous hours

94
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
And I would certain aerate in and out of different segments

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
And so from 8 to 11.

96
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Playing my show House boar. Big

97
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
At the time which means I wasn't just making the thing but I had to sit at the board

98
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,031
Hit play on the CD and then it between our one and hour to an hour to an hour

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
R3 I got to say the weather

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
I was doing the whole thing

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
And after me Joe Frank would come on

102
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
And he was part of my shift

103
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
And everytime I J

104
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Just be like

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
F is this that I would just be sitting there listening to him and just

106
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
Like amazing like mentally taking notes be like oh

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
This guy has a

108
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Feel

109
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
There's a surreality and a disorienting Ness

110
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
To his stuff that I just really fascinated by and I was like oh I want to

111
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Going to do that

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Can we play that one that we

113
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Said that we can play

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
It was a time when I danced on a street corner

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Dressed as a chicken

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
My job was to draw attention to a furniture store down the block

117
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
One evening

118
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
When my shift was over

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Still wearing my chicken outfit

120
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
I walked into a bar across the street

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
I go to the Bombay martini

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Straight up

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
IMAX on the side

124
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
Prostitutes sat down next to me

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
She was young

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Willow Way

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
A Faraway look in her eyes

128
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
We talked about our careers

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
The importance of networking

130
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Focus

131
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Then I excused myself

132
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Walk into the men's room

133
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
Sat down on the toilet

134
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Had a bowel movement too broken to

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
And half of it was still hanging out of me

136
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
So I had to wipe myself 50 times

137
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
Repeatedly checking to see

138
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
Who's more left toilet paper

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
Written on the wall for the words

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Know that someone is suffering anonymously

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
And unknown

142
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
By the time you read this

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Oh that's good

144
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
That's really good

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Wow there's nothing wrong

146
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Who's playing that

147
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Clip

148
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,751
Actually he's not using any bad words true and you just have to see violations there

149
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Simply

150
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Growth and yet

151
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
You tell me that there is a

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Person on the planet

153
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
That has

154
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
Joe Frank always had the quality of like he's coming from inside your head out and then back in again he has that kind of quality

155
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
It sounds like he's somehow like the voice in your head but broadcast back into your head are there something about that quality

156
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
That's what I want from the radio is what I want from

157
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Guess I want someone to be speaking

158
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Inside me

159
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Anyway

160
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Have you ever talked about

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Joe Frank

162
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
2

163
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
I give this talk

164
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
3040 times a year

165
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Where I have like

166
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
An extended Joe Frank excerpt

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
I have an image of Joe Frank that I show

168
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Yeah I talked about you all the time

169
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
The vast majority of our listeners

170
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Other people listening to this

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm going to have to assume they never heard of Joe Frank and

172
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
He was always available on

173
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Podcast

174
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
He was like this

175
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Mystery

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
2

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,383
People who weren't willing to sort of follow the breadcrumbs to him I'll tell you I mean when I give

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Talk that I

179
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
That I have to give

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
I go through the series of

181
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
People live in FLA

182
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Let's meat

183
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Always ask any Joe Frank fans in the house

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Diesel be like audience

185
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
2500 people

186
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
One time

187
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
One time

188
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
What happened

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Like there's a clap in the far right now

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Joe Frank fan

191
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
It always broke my heart a little bit

192
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Cuz no one ever knew

193
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
His stuff

194
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
Like amongst us our little turtle Posse radio people

195
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
She's a legend

196
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Nobody on the outside of her do him

197
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
You know

198
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
This is going to be there Chan

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Last night I dreamt I was lost on an elevator all the floors were the same

201
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
And I realize the elevator was moving horizontally so I tried another elevator

202
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
The express but it just got be more lost faster

203
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
People kept getting on and getting off the roll wearing green gauze over their heads who were smoking ice cream cones

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
I said please let me on 39th Street and the conductor said this is 35th Street.

205
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
3 blocks and take the escalator but when I got to the escalator it was just a phone booth

206
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
So I need to call I called my father I said hello

207
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
Post on 39th Street looking for an escalator and I can't find it anywhere and he said

208
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
I'll be right there and there we was in the phone booth started moving for

209
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
Very slowly with my father and I in it and I didn't know where it was going or why and he said

210
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
Don't be afraid this phone booth will take us home and I said but we have

211
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
And he said we live on the 8th floor apartment why

212
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,495
I said why and he said

213
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Yes

214
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,999
That was a condensed version of a conversation I had with Brooke Gladstone for on the media

215
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,607
Can find a full conversation upon the media. Org

216
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
Pool return with one more Joe Frank recollection in just a moment

217
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Is Michael Burrows from Portland Oregon

218
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311

222
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,951
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

223
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,071
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

224
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about

226
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Kids you know did something

227
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kids

228
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
You've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

229
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

230
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,935
Maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

231
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

232
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
Doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

233
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,807

00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Hello

244
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Hey how's it going

245
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
It's going okay

246
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
It's going okay

247
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
There are two entirely different okay's just

248
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
For the purposes of this conversation I'm doing I'm doing just fine

249
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
All right did you know Joe Frank

250
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
No I had one interaction with your Frank

251
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Which was

252
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
It was almost

253
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Perfectly Joe Frank

254
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
And that

255
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
I met him once at Third Coast and he

256
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
I asked him something and he looked at me for a long time and then just

257
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Walked away

258
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,119
That was my window Frank interactions

259
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,191
Do you remember what you asked I think I might have

260
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215

00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823

Let me know and he just looked at me like

00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,063
You have the gall just walked away

266
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111

So what do you remember about who I'm just like what what you saw cuz you will you work for them

268
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Right

269
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Basically when I was when I was 20

270
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
I had my first paid job at NPR

271
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,799
And I was there a production assistant to this guy whose job it was to invent new ways to

272
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Tudo radio for NPR

273
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
And get a Regular Show when he would do different things in

274
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
Weeks and then he brought Joe Frank down from New York

275
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,319
And that was the thing we're doing for a while and I was Jose production assist

276
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
As my very first paid job at NPR

277
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
And I ain't never heard it on the radio I mean he wasn't

278
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
National media

279
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
So I'm never like

280
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
A few very specific memories for

281
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
Trish suhr

282
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
The best way I can explain it is like

283
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
I've had the experience a number of times over the years where people try to tell me

284
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,871
Liko the first time I heard your show

285
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Was this

286
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,991
And generally the singer trying to say to me is like I didn't know that the radio could

287
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
Did I mean like I didn't realize it like old radio could you like

288
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Australian

289
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Feel like this

290
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
And I myself had that exact

291
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Experience the person who I had it

292
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Was Joe Frank

293
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
And dumb

294
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
And I remember there was a day

295
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Early on

296
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,751
And I was standing in the old control room at NPR's original Studios like the original two

297
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Studios they have

298
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Studio 1 Studio 2 on the 1st

299
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
420 20 amps

300
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
We're in studio 2

301
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Standing by the reel to reel tape

302
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Get the bank of them

303
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
And I remember Joe was

304
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Telling one of the stories I remember feeling like

305
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Oh I've never

306
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
I've never heard this before I just remember feeling like

307
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,863
Like this like this thing like I didn't end end end it was just elected feel like

308
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Totally caught up in a story

309
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,287
And you don't exactly know why you're so caught up with it and you don't know where it's going

310
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
And

311
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
And you just want to stay with us

312
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
In the sound of

313
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Voice is such an incredible

314
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Radio performer

315
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
Like much better than you were made

316
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
I don't remember which specific story it was I do remember have gone back because there was one story of particular called the

317
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,911
In fact I've gone and dug up that I remember at the

318
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Hi

319
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,519
I thought like this is at this sums up the whole thing

320
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,151
Literally what it is I'm riding up the elevator of my building is he gets on an elevator

321
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
I'm standing there sharing with small space with a

322
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,063
Terrific looking girl he totally gets a crush on this woman but I feel shy

323
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Edible

324
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Scratch my head

325
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Vici

326
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
I gaze up at the numbers of the floors lighting up one after another imagine their life together and everything that they will be

327
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
She seems like

328
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Kind of person I'd

329
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Really like

330
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
Eddie cannot bring himself

331
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
To stand there silently

332
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Not looking at each other

333
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Say a word to her

334
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Edsel

335
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Pulls out something from his

336
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
How can I reach into my pocket and draw out

337
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
Paper which I unfold

338
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
It turns out to be a cash register tape from the A&P

339
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,487
But I scrutinize it is if it's very important before putting it back in my pocket

340
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
It has a guy come very magnetic

341
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Forward motion and it's like 4 5 minutes long

342
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
And the entire thing happens in the elevator

343
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,103
Are you going to races describing the floors going up and all the feelings he has

344
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
You go through your life looking and looking

345
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Sometimes you see her.

346
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
The woman you might have loved

347
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Might have loved you at a bus stop

348
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
Museum across a smoky room at a party

349
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
In the lobby of a theater

350
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
Online at the supermarket

351
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
In an elevator

352
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
When she leaves in a panic you want to run out to her calling out to stop

353
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Stop

354
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
It's me the person you were meant for

355
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Don't you recognize me

356
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
I may seem like a stranger but I'm the person you've been waiting for

357
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
The one in your dreams

358
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
But you just stand there and watch her leave

359
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
This happens to me with a different woman about once each day

360
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
And I remember

361
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
What has 20

362
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Curing that and being like this is at

363
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
This guy is doing

364
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Like I want to know

365
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
I want to know how you do that

366
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,687
Yes for me the equivalent thing with Debbie hurt his rent a family

367
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Trilogy

368
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
No, I'd be hard-pressed at 2

369
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
To summarize a story but it's essentially it's a

370
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
This whole world in which families can be rented

371
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
For occasion

372
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
When I saw this ad

373
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
And it said

374
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
Rent a family

375
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
We have certain

376
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
Package programs

377
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,471
Where an individual can experience over the course of

378
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,055
The twelve-month period A pretty considerable rain

379
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
The family

380
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Hi

381
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
And it's all like in this very documentary

382
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Format and it's done really well so you can

383
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Okay sometimes like

384
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,023
Aren't totally sure that what you're hearing is a drama that sounds super real

385
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Society

386
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Seems to be

387
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Speeding up

388
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Before I buried

389
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
The whole idea of renting thing

390
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Have to do with the people's desire

391
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
Do not have a permanent commitment to them

392
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
I think it's important to recognize

393
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
Depth of loneliness

394
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
That

395
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
That must be addressed

396
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
The end like doesn't resolve at all you'll just left would like 12 different feelings that you don't even know what to do with

397
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
I think that's that's what he represents

398
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,559
You're like thrown in the middle of the action and it's greeting you don't understand it's kind of dark

399
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
And it's not all going to get resolved all the answers aren't going to be given to you

400
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,519
And enjoy going to have like weird feelings you don't know what to do with and often it's good over reach

401
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
And it's not even going to work

402
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
But it was still kind of cool

403
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,735
You don't like all of that is completely his completely 70s film turned into radio

404
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
So what is it

405
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
Is it you think you took with you from Joe Frank and putting to This American Life

406
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,463
I mean honestly the first thing is just what he gave me the most important thing which was desire

407
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
To do it

408
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,071
Hearing him made me want to make stories

409
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
And then I spent a decade

410
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
Trying to figure out how to do it

411
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
With ax

412
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
And with reporting

413
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
The thing that started me

414
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
With that ambition was him so that's one thing

415
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,711
The second thing is I'm just the way he would use music in the way that the music would pull the story forward and

416
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Create a mood but also kind of like

417
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
She went to the dream of it the notion that you'd use music as a kind of cinematic

418
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Scoring

419
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,743
Which is not the way you know music would be used in old time radio dramas and certainly not the Wave Music

420
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
NPR

421
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,631
And the way you use music is so built into me that a couple of years

422
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
After this American life was on the air

423
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
Joe is already letting out in California have been for

424
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
And I like mutual friends I mean Ohio is so angry with

425
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
And I was like why is Joe so angry with me

426
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
You like why is he so angry

427
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
And it turned out that Joe thought that I was listening to his show

428
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
And stealing the music oh yeah

429
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
And I got in touch with him

430
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,839
And he's just like it's so petty said this is so petty

431
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,727
Choosing any music and you listening to my show is like it take me so long to find decent music and I

432
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Edited so carefully

433
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
You know it's such a part of the identity of the show

434
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,151
Are you just listen to my show it rip me off like do a little work brother

435
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
Isaac Joe it's so

436
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
Much worse than that like the fact is like I haven't heard you're showing years I haven't heard him so sorry and would have

437
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
I just learned how to use music from you

438
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,488
Pat Metheny comes out with a new record

439
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
I hear the same track you do and you're the same possibility in it and I just do the same thing because like it's so built into who I am

440
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
So in a way like I am totally stealing from you but I'd swear I guess I didn't know it

441
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Did you ever

442
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
Did you ever like Linda in a good place and he was fine at the end of it I think

443
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,160
It seems so small what's the matter with you

444
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
Yeah so there's that and

445
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
What else carries forward

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
I mean I mean it's it's

447
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
Honestly there's a thing or two that he does

448
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,872
That I have never figured out how to imitate that in the back of my mind

449
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
I still feel like I'm going to stay

450
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,040
And one of them is a thing I came up last week I was talking to Parker one of those like the younger producers

451
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
I just say what I think she went to do in kind of a moment that she really loves and she's to be a film professor

452
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,280
And is like a super cinematic think she was shooting for us like you know what you should really listen to disguise Your Friends cheat

453
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Heard of him

454
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,608
I downloaded last week I bought a downloaded

455
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
The eighty yard run

456
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Have you heard that one now no never heard

457
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
God

458
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,848
It's a super early one in fact I think it's just an aircheck of one of his WBAI broadcast

459
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Play with natural actual

460
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
Live radio show

461
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
I've done late at night

462
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
It's just him in a microphone with music

463
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
And he's telling the story of what he keeps referring to as

464
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
I like to call it my Infamous 80-yard run

465
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Twisted

466
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
Convoluted tale now before I get to the

467
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
The full story of my life

468
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
I hope

469
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
You will bear with me

470
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
There's a few things you need to know

471
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
The first and the first thing you need to know is

472
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Despite between

473
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Luis Rodriguez

474
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
And Rubin Hurricane Carter

475
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
Professional fight

476
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
That happened over the years and tell them

477
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Oh wow

478
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Terrible beating

479
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Standing crop top

480
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Unconscious

481
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
And then there comes a point when he's like

482
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,232
Did you like 6 or 8 but it's another thing and he says

483
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,328
Stop before I can tell you that part of the store you need some this next thing and I would tell you that

484
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,864
After a brief interlude

485
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
During which I will

486
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Drink some tea

487
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
The music

488
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Comes up

489
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
And then he just leaves

490
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
God

491
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:56,416
30 years trying to figure out how to steal that I don't even know how to do it

492
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,464
I honestly honestly

493
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
I don't know man

494
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
I mean I mean like like

495
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
I'm going to figure it out

496
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
The first

497
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,456
That's Ira Glass from This American Life thanks to him thanks also to Brooke lasting from on the media

498
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
Anti sarkari and Kelly Prime

499
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
Nothing more perfect crew who produces tribute

500
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,392
Also a very special thanks to Michael story

501
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,744
If you want to hear excerpts of Joe Frank's work which I would highly recommend

502
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
Go to joefrank.com his entire archive is there will also link you to a from radiolab.org

503
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Here I think

504
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
If you listen

505
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Iran I talked about

506
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
This is it

507
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:49,152
Even though he's a guy who's inspired so many of us to get into the business of telling stories

508
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
Nobody sounds like him

509
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
Still because it's completely impossible to imitate

510
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
Into the hundreds of thousands of podcasts that are happening now

511
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Is nobody doing anything as

512
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,768
Daring and competent at the same time

513
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,376
Yeah I could so singular you can't really imitate it very well

514
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:15,008
And I'm personally not one who believes it matters like if your work clothes on past you

515
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
The people of the future

516
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,408
I meant to be enjoyed like

517
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,016
I'm doing right now and then like if no one ever listens to them again after we're gone like

518
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
Wolf pack them anyway like walking around in

519
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,648
Being alive while we're dead first bumfuk office people

520
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
Being alive and having sandwiches and beating for lunch while we're dead

521
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,632
And not existing like I hate them already they can f*** themselves

522
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
But it seems that it seems sad that

523
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
That that other

524
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
People

525
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Lake won't know this

526
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Weird thing that I know it's a special

527
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,504
You know like he's so outpacing everybody even now even out there like this Army of

528
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Of people making podcasts

529
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
I tried to invent something that's like nobody else is doing

530
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672
He still is he still has outpaced every single one of them

531
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
From the grave

532
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
That's perfect life and

533
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
