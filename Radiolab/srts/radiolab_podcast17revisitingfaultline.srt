1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,368
So we can start with a story for my producer Pat Walters

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
About a couple

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Oh my word

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Okay so

8
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,768
I mentioned a couple episodes ago

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
By the way this is Chad Radiolab.

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,680
Will be bringing back some episodes back to the flow from time to time episodes that we haven't

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:44,544
Stop thinking about the field true or to us now than before maybe the opposite

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
New episodes

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
We still end up getting two fights with people about and a couple years ago we ran a story about a guy named Kevin

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
A little bit more recently hello Robert are you there

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,624
Yes snake gentle be here in just a sec

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,720
Robert sapolsky Stanford who

17
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,536
College and I have had on the show many times

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Seriously would have booked

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,936
Which makes an argument that really tries to kind of just explode

20
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
That story

21
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Anyway that we found her dancers

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
It was just my hunch

23
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
That it plays near a lot of your button

24
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Sure does

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
So what we did was we sent him that piece having listened to it

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,856
NXT will do now is Replay that piece and then at the end

27
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
We'll come back and

28
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
A little bit of a fight about it

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
So we can start

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
With a story for my producer Pat Walters about a couple

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Oh my word

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
The lady and Shannon

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
This is the guy I don't need you to introduce yourself that's usually the thing we do but we're not dumb people who you are

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
We're going to call him Kevin Kevin yeah yeah yeah that's

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah that's my name

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
That's suspicious at all it's not his real name

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
No make sense why we're not using his real name

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
Okay but this one starts a few summers ago

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
It was July 2006

40
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Dan and Kevin went home

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
And

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Some people

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
You don't know

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Chill up and maybe I'll start with you

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
When they show up at the door

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
So we were it was we were getting ready to go down the shore was a Friday so we so we're in the kitchen and and they

47
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
Come to the back door but I thought that I thought they were fundraising

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,432
I thought they might even firemen just by you not that the blue the blue shirt and then realize that

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
That they were

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Law enforcement

51
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
Two women and two men

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm around that you know the side of the house and they show us their badges

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Are they cops

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Next door neighbor Homeland Security

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
They took me outside and they asked me to stay in the kitchen

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
And they had a woman with me

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
I didn't know it was going to nobody said anything to me sing to you on the porch

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Meanwhile

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
When they when they showed up

60
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
I got to the door

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,016
I said you know why we're here I said yeah I do I was expecting you

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
I showed him everything was

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
This story about Kevin and his wife Janet inspired us to do the entire hour cuz it when was

64
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Basic things that we do

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Is we judge

66
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
You just want another judge what's right

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
What's wrong with this story of the two that follow

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
They will make you judge how you judge

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
At least they have that effect on us

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Can I show

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Blink

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
Omron arm Robert krulwich mogul

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Baidu

74
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
You should know that this show contains some graphic

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Difficult descriptions in a few

76
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Teaspots

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Turn on the mood or if you have kids around

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
You might want to sit this one out

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,864
Okay so what happened in that first scene and what happens next

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Only makes sense

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
If we go back there

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
The first

83
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
About 15 years

84
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
It's just an ordinary day Kevin

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Going home from work

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
And

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
I was

88
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Driving home

89
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
Going about 65 70 in the fast lane

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
When

91
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Suddenly

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
There was a thump

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
In my chest then he just that I hate voting

94
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
After that he said suddenly he had this thickness in my tongue in my throat and a foul taste in his mouth

95
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
Then

96
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
My hearing

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Spit it out

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Enneathought

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Its back

100
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
If I did come to

101
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
He sees his car smashed into the side of an

102
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
I do recall the officers, you've been in an accident you better than any members want them insisted that he soon

103
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Smelled alcohol

104
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
And I was talking through clenched teeth cuz I had bit my tongue and

105
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
And my cheeks

106
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
I was saying over and over again

107
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
I had a seizure

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
I had a seizure

109
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
Kevin Scott epilepsy

110
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
He's had it since he was a teenager

111
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
But two years before this all happened he had surgery to remove the part of his brain that was causing the seizures

112
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
End

113
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,391
It seemed to work to be doing great eventually wasn't having seizures anymore

114
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Until suddenly with you

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
He was

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
Lost your license I lost my license for a year things have kind of taken a nosedive like here he is he's 35

117
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
5 years old I'm living with my brother I'm divorced

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,007
And I have to call my Daddy and ask him now

119
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
To drive me to and from work

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
And you saying

121
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
I need to do something this is not sustainable

122
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Now don't don't need that

123
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
So I walked into the office at HR person where he works

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Export a list of all the employees

125
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
Give me a list of everybody who were the front so she pulled it up I go down the list and I get to Janet Woodruff Bloomfield

126
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Only one asteroid close to me 5 minutes away

127
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
So I walk

128
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
To work you

129
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Knocked on the on the wall

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
And

131
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Introduce myself

132
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Like hey my name is Kevin

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
House of work here

134
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
I got this thing though

135
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
He's kind of awkward I can't drive

136
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
And I was wondering if

137
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
You give me a ride

138
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
And

139
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
She said yes

140
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
I really pass by his street I mean on the way to work so it was

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
Right on History pretty much but I made it clear and you know I'll do it when I can start talking finding out

142
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Little bit more about each other

143
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
Notice pretty quickly we like the same music that was unique because I sort of

144
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Like music that was probably more in his error Kevin was 7 years older than what kind of music are you listening to

145
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,527
Jackson Browne mostly lie detector on James Taylor

146
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
Bonnie Raitt it's a little you know Elton John

147
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
They found themselves

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Sing along to the lyrics

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
You cannot sing

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
With somebody

151
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Day in and day out

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
And not have something

153
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
We want them as a spring came you know it's getting nice out so now it's like well let's not go home as well for a beer after work we're becoming

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
We'd like each other over Kevin

155
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
It was a little more serious than that

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
I'm thinking about her and I'm starting to wake up at night and what day in May is Jenna is dropping him off

157
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,391
Turn stir and he says I really appreciate what you've done for me let me take you to dinner

158
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Dentist

159
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Sure so

160
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
May 30th

161
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
1992

162
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Highlawn Pavilion

163
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,887
Nicest restaurant in town so your friend takes you to a 4-star restaurant you're thinking right away

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
He thinks this is a date come on now I'm panic-stricken we have our dinner we leave

165
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
She drops me off and I handed her the poem

166
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
What is the poem say

167
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
You still have it

168
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Yeah I do

169
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Okay this is a little slower

170
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Each time we sing on the way home

171
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
I pray that traffic backs up

172
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
So we can sing together

173
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Just a little longer

174
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
And the harmony can go on forever

175
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
And each time you reach my door

176
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
I feel robbed

177
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Because we're always admit song

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Amidst thought

179
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,287
Only he gets out and goes inside and try things awesome I gave her the phone she's going to be so

180
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Smitten with me and you go home and what

181
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Want to throw up

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
I just thought I'd got it you know

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
Next day I just looked at him and said listen we got to clarify this

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
This is clearly just going to be a friendship

185
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
He was 7 years older than me he had to

186
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Your brain

187
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
You know surgery he has epilepsy

188
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,095
He's divorced he has two children

189
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Try and try and he's just like

190
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
I'm not asking you to marry me

191
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
I'm asking you go out on a few dates

192
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
I can go out with me like four times in the next 6 months

193
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
I'm ahead of the game just handled it

194
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Then I don't think it was long at all I can't even remember but it wasn't long at all before we were like

195
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
A couple

196
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
And Kevin I'm Dopey

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,207
Ethiopian love romantic things for her all the time

198
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
Flowers poems and illustration of the Jackson Browne cover Anthony year

199
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
All the while Kevin is having seizures since the car accident

200
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
It was a point where we were obviously Dayton

201
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
Japanese make his bed and

202
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
He said she pulled up the pillowcase

203
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Covered with blood stain

204
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
1 2 3

205
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
4 5 6 7 and count the number of seizures that I had

206
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
In between my tongue and bled I knew nothing about

207
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Epilepsy

208
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,375
I never seen anybody have a seizure in my past those would have been big red flags that I would have just walked away but

209
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
I just went with it

210
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
And they both want with it

211
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
50 years

212
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
Until finally Kevin agenda side

213
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
This is not what I wanted to be done with it

214
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
I just needed to be done with it

215
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
To reschedule a brain surgery

216
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Which sounds like a big deal and obviously it is but they had every reason to think that this wouldn't change him

217
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,463
I honestly thought that he was going to come out of it fine a better

218
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,839
Quebec map in the first time giving head actually gone through a brain surgery much like this one once before

219
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Any come out

220
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Pretty much the same guy you still himself

221
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
In fact

222
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
He made sure of it

223
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
I had a I was awake for the surgery

224
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
That's crazy

225
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
It was had to be awake

226
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Had to do with me

227
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Kevin is a musician

228
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
And the doctors told him they said that if I lost anything I was going to lose my appreciation for music

229
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
That it would be like music with the white noise

230
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Pasadena now for me music was

231
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
Is part of my personality

232
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
It was how I cope with

233
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
My Darkest

234
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Moments in dealing with epilepsy and seizures

235
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
At 18 years old

236
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
I have a seizure

237
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
I take whatever Monica and I find a place

238
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Decent Reverb somewhere and be right where I needed to be

239
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
I didn't want to lose that part of me

240
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,647
Do I have the doctors were doing the brain surgery that had his head open bathroom to sing remember what you saying

241
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
End of the Innocence

242
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Some James Taylor

243
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
While he's saying they would tickle

244
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Different parts of his brain

245
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
If you ever touch the part that made him stop singing

246
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
They say okay that's a part we cannot take out

247
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Wow

248
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,079
And in the end I think they ended up taking out like 4 and 1/2 cm

249
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,735
Like a little bit of a bigger than a golf ball well but afterwards that he was recovering the I had my keyboard in the

250
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,087
And I tried playing right away data data data data.

251
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
It works

252
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Partying that you really cared about

253
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,023
Was still there exactly after the first surgery so

254
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
I thought well you know

255
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
None of the country's second surgery he's already been down this road

256
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
We're fine

257
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
And after that second surgery

258
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Editing by Janet didn't have her brother

259
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Sneak my my keyboard up to the room again very very adamant that he wanted that keyboard

260
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,087
Just noodles a couple of notes played a couple of things and it was like okay I'm there

261
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
Tell me I was ready to go

262
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
To you go home and like

263
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
It seems to have worked

264
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,119
Yeah for seizures go we thought okay this is it we're home free and I was just happy to have some normalcy

265
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,959
But then in the winter by beginning the middle of January

266
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
Kevin knows he wanted to eat my physical appetite

267
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
A lot more than usual. Like insane

268
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
Or maybe a snack that was it but now I could eat the couch

269
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,391
It just was I thought it was not him normally but you know you're like okay

270
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
But then the piano

271
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
You play the piano for hours

272
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
Sing songs to sing in the car together he has stuck on a piece

273
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
He would play it for hours

274
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
How many hours

275
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Eight nine

276
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
And then

277
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
No sex

278
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
You know we were happy

279
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Healthy couple

280
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
Kevin's nodding

281
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
What was abnormal was it was it was anywhere clearly wasn't like all we're in the supermarket let's have sex here

282
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
I mean it wasn't like that but I mean it was like

283
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
I could just walk in the kitchen I'm an out-of-work and helical you let's go here

284
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Which structure is weird

285
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,095
But then again we were thinking you know let's try to have a family make things confusing

286
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,703
And what's in that it wasn't like any of this stuff was out of character exactly

287
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Fact

288
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
It was all stuff.

289
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:36,383
She liked about him yeah that was all turned up to 11 all the things that were wonderful

290
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Became tours

291
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
And that's pretty much where things are at

292
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
When is federal agent showed up in July 2000

293
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
I was just completely blindsided

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
I said you know why we're here I said yeah I do I was

295
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Expecting you

296
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Kevin contagions upstairs

297
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
I took him right into here where my computer was

298
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
And they arrested him

299
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
For what was on that computer

300
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
I gave it up to him

301
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Right away

302
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Warning this next batch

303
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Which contains some graphic

304
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
I mean I I hadn't

305
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
I don't know if I am fully like

306
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
I think I had just like black c********* be this kind of vague

307
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Thing that meant

308
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
Someone younger than 18

309
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
But then I read some of the

310
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
The court documents in

311
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
They were like

312
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Toddlers

313
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Hair pic videos of

314
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
2 3 in

315
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
4 year olds

316
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
There their ID sites had the most

317
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Despicable disgusting

318
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Thanks

319
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
You can imagine

320
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Infants on throw

321
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Yeah pretty

322
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Preteen in

323
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Pre-adolescent up in at adolescence

324
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Did it right and you bought this

325
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
And put them on your

326
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Computer eye

327
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Yeah

328
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Yeah it it it bothers me

329
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
It bothers me

330
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Like

331
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
Like I said initially it was and I was just your basic your basic

332
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,423
You know how to roast heterosexual Playboy like Penthouse like

333
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Sites

334
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
And then

335
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
Windows would just start to open up pretty soon he says

336
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
He's going every

337
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
It was gay sex they were for me that there was due is bondage there was

338
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
Defecation sex there was a********* is Zeno sex

339
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
I went everywhere

340
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
That a button came up

341
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
The Porsche

342
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
I still don't understand it

343
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
I still I still don't understand

344
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
He said Disturbed you and you feel terrible. I just like Wonder like how do you

345
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
Do you tell yourself like that wasn't me like how do you

346
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Explain it to yourself to

347
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
So that you can kind of

348
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
And I'm not feel like you're

349
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
As bad as

350
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
The person who goes there

351
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Without a brain injury

352
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
You know like

353
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:06,143
Say that again I guess I'm just wondering I don't know like knowing that the thing that you did and it sounds like obviously you know that that was bad

354
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Ever the wrong thing

355
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Terrible thing

356
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
But it was

357
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,567
It was you who did it or was it not

358
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
I don't know you going to mean

359
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
No it was it was me who did it but it was me

360
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
With a

361
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Complete lack

362
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Under a logical control

363
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
Not I mean I know

364
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
I know who I am

365
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,631
I did idiotic things that I couldn't stop myself from doing I didn't want to do it

366
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,519
It would be nice where would be 456 hours of going to the same site and end in

367
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
Downloading one or two files and then deleting them

368
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Going back

369
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
A minute later

370
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Downloading the same files deleting them

371
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
I would download those files a dozen times and delete him a dozen times cuz I didn't want to be there knew I shouldn't be there in

372
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
And couldn't help myself from going back

373
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
I'm not an idiot

374
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,535
I mean I'm on the smart guy I'm not an idiot

375
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
I know I had no control

376
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Ineptitude arguing Court

377
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
Can we plead guilty but at the sentencing hearing he asked the judge to be lenient

378
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,615
Arguing isn't played that the person who did all those things in some sense

379
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Wasn't him

380
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
It was some other part of

381
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
His brain that he couldn't control

382
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Play the hearing he called one witness

383
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,391
Orrin devinsky I'm a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center

384
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,463
Even treating Kevin for decades 20 20 some odd years

385
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,303
And he says as soon as he found out what Kevin had been doing had a terrible sense of

386
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,119
Of responsibility this is because the brain surgery

387
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
The surgery on recommended he have

388
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
Target in court that this was not Kevin's fault

389
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
I remember looking at those agents right in their face

390
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
And sing to them and to the judge

391
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,783
This could be anybody this could be those agents judge this could be you this could be me this could be anybody

392
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,855
And we would have no control over what we did

393
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,415
Explain to the court what the biology was

394
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,351
That the way the brain is working that is it there parts of our brain that are way deep down

395
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
The control

396
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Base desire

397
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
Mike hunger

398
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Sex keep the faith alive but it's teeming with the nastiest thoughts we all have these crazy thoughts in her head

399
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,943
Most of us are kept in check because there are other parts of our brain that sit on top

400
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
And act like a lid

401
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Bank Evans case

402
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
The brain surgeon you did that surgery

403
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Remove part of that filter

404
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,767
And suddenly the cork was off I mean it was just no lid

405
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,655
On his sexual desires he's a scientist

406
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Condition for a long time difference. In monkeys

407
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
The rhesus monkeys when the monkeys would lose roughly the same part of the brain that Kevin laws they became very hyper sexual males

408
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,943
It would only previously be sexually involved with females

409
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,783
Now we're ten times more sexually active with both males and females

410
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
David feels too meme

411
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Feels to me like there's a

412
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
It would be a brighter line

413
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Before

414
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Kids

415
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
You know

416
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
I think

417
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
There is a line for quote-unquote normal individuals

418
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,935
But in a brain disorder case those lines get blurred

419
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
And he told the court

420
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
That's what happened here was black and white can with sick

421
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
End behavior without his control

422
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Well

423
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
That's not what

424
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
The facts showed

425
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
In this case

426
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
This is Lee Vartan what's the

427
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
We saw no evidence of impulsivity

428
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
He says if you're claiming that he had no control that his brain made him do it then how come he had all this c********* on his home computer

429
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
I believe it was

430
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,887
52 videos and 125 images on his work computer images

431
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,727
0 videos of child Pornography on his work computer

432
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
And you worked a lot

433
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,079
He held down a job he was working everyday

434
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,407
If you truly lack impulse control I would think

435
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
You would see

436
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Child pronography on both computer

437
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Nobody argued back was

438
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:11,135
What with the lid on at work and off at home seems to me to be an easy out

439
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
The answer is that this is common with neurologic

440
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Disease

441
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
They tend not to be

442
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
24/7

443
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,143
If it's taken to make tourettes some people when they're engaged and playing sports

444
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
They tend not to have pics

445
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Redlands didn't ground for distress

446
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
They do that.

447
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,151
So you could say well-dressed clearly isn't a neurological disorder but no Tourette's is a neurologic disorder we understand

448
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
Some of the brain things that go on Tourette's

449
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
The prosecution didn't buy it

450
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Thought it was hogwash

451
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
What was hogwash was his level of certainty

452
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
Breskis and ask the Kevin be sent to prison for 5 years

453
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
Isn't paying for c********* you supporting industry

454
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
It does terrible things to kids

455
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,751
Kevin Oakes YouTube or jail time altogether and instead you placed on house arrest

456
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Casper Janet

457
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Rid of beer breath

458
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Captain imagine that

459
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
You are in chocolate. Like

460
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Uganda City lawyer

461
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
One of the questions he asked was this marriage going to survive this

462
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
And I said

463
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
I don't know

464
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
And at that point understand I didn't even know

465
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
The level of picture

466
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,656
But she said the moment she heard orange say that this was a brain disorder with the name

467
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
Kluver bucy syndrome once I was able to

468
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
Get that for me

469
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
A click like

470
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
You complain that we have these experts saying that

471
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
It was a disease and I kept thinking they'll understand

472
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
Give him some medication and dances

473
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
It was like flipping a switch

474
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
It's exactly what it was was like yeah yeah and back

475
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
He's Able I was able to sit and watch a movie with

476
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
You know normal

477
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Did it actually says in a lot of ways those few months

478
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Between the arrest

479
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
In the sentencing hearing

480
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Baton

481
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,032
The best months in a marriage he now is just so much easier,

482
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
You could we just talk

483
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,688
The hearing took about 3 hours and when it was over the judge took a recess

484
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Winter Chambers

485
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
When she came back

486
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
She delivered your decision

487
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
And we'll hear that decision when we come back

488
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Traffic break

489
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
This is Amanda Darby

490
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Calling from Rockville Maryland

495
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,152
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

496
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,272
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting the show

497
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

498
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

499
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Brilliance

500
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,376
Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something

501
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
It just means you bring back and say whoa

502
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,104
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

503
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

504
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,016
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

505
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,880
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

506
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
We're interested in the

507
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Epic moments where

508
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,816
Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

509
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
If you have a story with us

510
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:38,240
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message

511
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Fan that's radiolab.org / brilliance

512
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Thank you so much

513
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,792
Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab we're revisiting Pat Walter story about Kevin and when we left

514
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,864
The judge was just about to render her decision

515
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,008
She actually wouldn't talk to me for the story but I have the transcript from the

516
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Hearing

517
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,896
And if you remember the prosecutor Bolivar 10 was asking for 5 years

518
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,480
63 months

519
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
Meaning no jail time there's no way this is clear-cut

520
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
Can use with the judge.

521
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
She says I do agree with orange it is a neurological disorder real question we can't be held fully responsible for

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Behavior she was getting

523
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,864
And she said the prosecution did have a point that

524
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
He was very much in control of his impulse

525
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
At least some of the

526
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,568
I took the question for the judge was how does the legal system assign blame

527
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
When a person is sometimes can selves and in control

528
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Sometimes not

529
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
This is a crime she said

530
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,648
A crime which ultimately leads to children being hired and considering that you did have moments where you were in control

531
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
But in those moments

532
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Responsibility

533
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
You could have done something

534
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Girl ask for help

535
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,144
You could have told the people around you what you were doing so even if you couldn't have stopped

536
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Takers.

537
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
She made it very clear

538
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
That we have to do something here

539
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Sentence

540
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
26 months

541
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
At a federal prison

542
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
And 25 months house arrest

543
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,088
And I I believe I believe that she she was she was fair

544
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
And I believe she was compassionate

545
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
About a week before Christmas

546
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
In 2008

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Introverted person

548
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
How long was he in jail for about 2 years

549
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
And she was even though the judge said you know

550
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
He is responsible to that

551
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
Change her attitude toward him at all now

552
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Totally stuck together she doesn't it

553
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Pretty much every weekend

554
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
The whole time

555
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,224
I knew the rude and I had my own little routine down

556
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,856
In between visits in the notes he could send me mail that a store where he could get some cards

557
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Super Walmart

558
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
And he would like alter them

559
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
I've ever remember the very first card I got

560
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
It was this very you know

561
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,632
Beautiful supposedly supposed to be beautiful but it was like you know if you need anything

562
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
You anything at all just let me know and then he writes

563
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,080
Of course if it's pressing you might want to ask someone else cuz you can wait 24 months

564
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:28,736
And I remember getting that and just laughing and then that became our thing like listen this is a horrible situation

565
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
But we're going to make the best of

566
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Tell me a little bit about like

567
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
Where things are at now are almost normal

568
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm still

569
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,376
On probation he's home he's working

570
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
Life is going on we have our normal routines

571
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Can still take those medicines that

572
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Keep that other part of him in check

573
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
I have no libido at all

574
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
But

575
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
I know who I am

576
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
I know what I am

577
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
I'm disturbed by that portion of my life

578
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
But I'm trying I'm trying to move on

579
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Producer Pat Walters

580
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
Sew-in no nothing about your reaction to that will be which is my hunch is author Roberts

581
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
That it's sort of

582
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
It plays near a lot of your butt

583
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Where does yeah

584
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
And know why we always felt

585
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,560
The at the end of the story the sentence that Kevin gets from the judge was this kind of

586
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
Interesting in Nuance balance

587
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Between

588
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,520
You know the idea that he just had a brain disease and the idea that there's some still Center of personal responsibility involved

589
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,152
All right out of the gate sapolsky had a different reaction, Paul

590
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
Underlying worldview

591
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Really

592
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Yeah completely

593
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
And for him it all centered around that sort of

594
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Key argument

595
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
This way the judge

596
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,208
That's some of the time he can control these urges

597
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
And some of the time he can't

598
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,632
The example and there was that never once it worked if you do anything like that and DFCS

599
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
You spend hours each night at home

600
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
And the fact that he could control it and other circumstances

601
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,848
Does that mean there is a separate me inside there

602
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,688
It's able to get to the control panel some of the time but not others

603
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
And thus

604
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
That's

605
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Punishable

606
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Yeah it said it's like

607
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,112
He's in a kind of

608
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Pitched battle

609
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
With some

610
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
Inner urge that he has maybe two biological urge

611
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
But

612
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
Sometimes he wins maybe in the morning when he sets

613
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
The coffee and he's like nicely sugared up

614
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,752
But then at night we all know this when we get tonight or if we're tired by brains are tired

615
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,848
And we the it comes out a tiny little bit well let's

616
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Let's translate what you just said

617
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
Industry nuts-and-bolts biology

618
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Your frontal cortex

619
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,112
Which is making you do the harder things when's the right thing to do is one of the most

620
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Expensive parts of the brain to operate

621
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
And when

622
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
You're starting to get hungry

623
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
Are you starting to get tired

624
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
Your frontal cortex doesn't work as well

625
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,632
And that's simply why

626
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:30,240
We have less regulation of our behavior in at night than in the morning

627
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:36,640
And the perfect neurological example where nobody would invoke Free Will in this one is he

628
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
You look at somebody with alzheimer's disease

629
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Beverly stage Alzheimer's disease

630
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
They sure was sundra a sundowner syndrome

631
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
Which is in the morning they can tell you what their name is

632
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
And by night they can't tell you

633
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
And the next morning they can tell you again

634
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Wow

635
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Are we here sort of

636
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,960
A choice okay so they know their name and if they're not telling you at night they know their name they can tell you

637
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,568
Username in the morning if they're not telling it to you at night they're choosing not to

638
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
No

639
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
What happens at night is blood sugar levels drop and the brain is tired and the frontal cortex which has to do the

640
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,576
Like what was my name again with three-and-a-half remaining neurons

641
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Can't do it as well

642
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,208
Nobody looks at that and says there's volition

643
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
They can do it part of the day

644
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
They should be expected to be able to do it and that's that. That's because it's a different issue I mean this isn't what you're talking about memory

645
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,704
Okay so let me let me

646
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Let me go through a sequence here that I am they obviously

647
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Prepared for the occasion

648
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
In the in the Kevin segment they made mention of the syndrome that he has which

649
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,272
Call the kluver Bucy syndrome

650
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,368
And this was first shown in the 1940s you going to monkeys

651
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,184
And you take out the same part of the frontal cortex

652
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,584
As they did with Kevin and you kept monkeys that eat themselves into obesity now they can't stop eating

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,472
Affair hyper-sexual male trying to mount everyone and everything on Earth

654
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,616
Can right off the bat we see some broad similarities haha you will say though

655
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,456
But Kevin has a moral system Kevin has

656
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
Meta control Kevin as we saw

657
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,600
Give control in some circumstances but not in others

658
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
We've left the world of blameless monkeys far behind

659
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,304
Yes yes yes yes goodbye but we have not you've got a monkey there

660
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,376
Who's got frontal damage and now is hyper sexual

661
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:38,496
He's attempting to mount infants he's attempting to mount water bottles in his cage

662
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
Completely out of control

663
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
But nonetheless

664
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
He doesn't try to mount the alpha male

665
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,760
Obviously what we have here is a monkey who has free will

666
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Because of some circumstances

667
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
He could not do this

668
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,416
Bad inappropriate thing cuz he's got free will Sumter

669
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
No that's ridiculous okay let's

670
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,024
It's not that he

671
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Could control his behavior

672
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
Some of the time it said in this instance

673
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
He was under the influence of something else

674
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
That he couldn't control

675
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Fear

676
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Fear of the alpha male activation of fear circuits override the feeble attempts of those for

677
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
And a half remaining from Ponder on interesting regulation in one circumstance but not in others not because there's

678
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
Free will or rotten choices or bad values

679
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,208
Is biologically broken system manifest is broken.

680
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
Under some circumstances but not others and

681
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,864
There's a logical biological explanation for why you get those exception

682
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Okay

683
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
But you're talking about monkeys and one situation we're not closer to home now

684
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,944
So you sit down somebody with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex

685
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
And you put

686
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,320
The frontal lobe damage patient now in a circumstance where they're in

687
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
A situation

688
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Where

689
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,208
There's a smarter more disciplined better pay off thing to do

690
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
And they can do it just fine

691
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,424
But then you get them emotionally aroused over something or you get them tired they're horrible terrible compared

692
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Two regular folks

693
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Another words

694
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,872
We've just progressed from okay the monkey if it's scared of the alpha male okay

695
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Fear

696
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,480
Can override the neurons that has remaining in there and they're swamped

697
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,040
Now we've seen in a human more in general

698
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
Strong emotions can override

699
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,904
But that so so far what you told me though

700
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Is

701
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,792
Sometimes I have the resources to choose and sometimes I don't but it's about the resource

702
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
For the choice

703
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Doesn't

704
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Not exist

705
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
In there

706
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Next Step

707
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
Next Step Closer in

708
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,896
So for my money one of them

709
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,528
I even have a clipboard here I've been sitting in front of me that's how much I prepared for this

710
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Okay here's an example

711
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
You take a Drudge

712
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
And

713
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
Like this

714
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Classic

715
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Important study

716
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,816
And you look at the single biggest predictor

717
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,632
Of whether or not this parole board judge and this was

718
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
The whole panel of judges

719
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
Whether they will vote for somebody being paroled or not

720
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,848
The single best predictor was how many hours has it been since the judge has eaten

721
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:30,016
What you mean is that a hungry judge will not give parole to someone but a full

722
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
And happy tummy tea in the judge will make it make the judge more gentle

723
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,440
You look at the study and right after a meal

724
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,024
Are convicts had about a 90% chance of being paroled

725
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,656
And right before meal they were down to about a 10% chance and was a virtually straight line going down X

726
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Messed up

727
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
And you know

728
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
The single biggest

729
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:53,312
Is Purdue episode up the study up and it turns out if the judge was making the decision

730
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
Right after lunch when they're full

731
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
Parolees had about a 60%

732
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Chance of getting pearls okay not as bad as you say

733
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
But

734
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
If the judges were making the decision right beef

735
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,160
For the next meal like when they were hungry

736
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
Parolees had close to a 0

737
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Percent chance of getting parole

738
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
What's interesting about

739
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Number one the biology make

740
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Perfect sense

741
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,800
What are you doing there when you are a judge trying to judge somebody from a completely different world from you to reach

742
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Your point of deciding

743
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:31,200
There's mitigating factors you're trying to take their perspective you were trying to

744
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
Think about the indirect ways that Lit

745
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
You're using your frontal cortex

746
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
And when you're hungry

747
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,720
And your frontal cortex isn't is working as well it's easier to make a snap emotional judgment

748
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Is person's rotten

749
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,584
The second amazing thing which exactly addresses this issue is

750
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
You get that judge

751
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
2 seconds after they made that decision

752
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,288
You sit him down at that point and say hey so why did you make that decision

753
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,176
And their get a quote on a no Immanuel Kant or Alan dershowitz that you they're going to

754
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Post hoc

755
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,064
Come up with an explanation that has all the pseudo trappings of

756
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,672
Free Will and volition and in reality it just rationalization

757
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
Totally biologic

758
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,048
No no that's you lose me on the word totally

759
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:24,448
Okay so it's met muchly biological mostly biological I might I might meet you halfway

760
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Totally know

761
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,824
Why does it have to be entirely why do we have to go out like all the way

762
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Because if you're not going to go

763
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
All the way

764
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Here's the things that

765
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
You're Siri

766
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
I'm just going to jump in here because this part of the conversation got a little dance

767
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
And a long butt

768
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Sapolsky basic

769
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Point was that you just have to look at

770
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
The story of Ark

771
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Scientific discoveries

772
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,120
500 years ago we would have said the epileptic seizure was

773
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
Like bad

774
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Demonic possession

775
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
Nanana we learned that biologic

776
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Up to the mid 1950

777
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
If you're like adolescent child suddenly started having hallucinations and hearing voices me thought disorder

778
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:12,320
And you would say you the mother of this child would say where did this disease come from

779
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,136
And the best of science at the time have an answer they would say

780
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
You it's your fault it was cold schizophrenogenic mothering a mothering style that generated schizophrenia

781
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
You cause your child schizophrenia

782
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,728
And then in the mid-fifties the first antipsychotic drugs were developed in it emptied out the psychiatric

783
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,056
Warts all over the country and everybody in the field said

784
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
Oh my God

785
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
It's a biochemical disorder

786
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:42,784
He says same thing happened with dyslexia we used to think it was just kids who are lazy oh that biological also

787
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,184
His contention is it this is just going to keep happening like a science progresses one by one all of the things that

788
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
We think are under our control

789
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
That we should control and that if we don't can be blamed for

790
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
One by one

791
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
All the things you can get chalked up two screw-ups in our biology

792
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Scrubs

793
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
That we couldn't have control even feed wanted to

794
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
So what you're going to have to do with that point

795
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Is

796
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Either say

797
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:13,248
Starting tonight at midnight there will never be a new scientific finding pertinent to this area we've learned

798
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Everything there is

799
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Or you're going to say

800
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,648
Free Will is just a biology that we haven't learned yet

801
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,912
Do you in your heart

802
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
In your deep in the even the center of your alike in that

803
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
Do you really believe this

804
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
Do you really think second

805
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
Not for a second

806
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
And that's the whole thing

807
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,320
This is like my like huge conundrum I have like zero belief in Free Will at this point

808
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,904
Yet at the same time I cannot for a second imagine

809
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:58,560
What the world is supposed to look like with people believe in there is no free will I don't know how to imagine it

810
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
And I'm constantly this hypocrite

811
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
On this terrible hypocrite

812
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,056
Because like I'll put on like my blue t-shirt instead of my gray t-shirt one morning

813
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
And later in the day someone will say how well

814
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,432
Nice t-shirt and all say

815
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Thanks

816
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
Oh my God the hypocrisy of it here I am taking credit for it

817
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,208
And that circumstance I'm not able to stop and say well actually

818
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
I have photoreceptor

819
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
That

820
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,632
No because of this Gene variant that she invariance in my robe. Saint-jean

821
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
So that I'm particularly good at noticing colors

822
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
Combination since I can get the matching ad

823
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,920
Oh I pick the fresh fruit here because my olfactory receptors allow me to like

824
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
Be able to smell the pineapples that are fresh

825
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
And the luck of my socioeconomic status has me in like some like organic market and gives me that like ability to

826
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,024
Did you do that while listening to like fake Peruvian music playing in the back at no you say

827
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
When they say you really know how to

828
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Pick good pineapple

829
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
And I say

830
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:13,056
Thanks

831
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,432
On the intellectual side I mean if you believe that every Behavior not just of Kevin

832
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,016
Because what you're really saying is that the Deep lessons the Kevin story

833
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
Is it everyone is okay

834
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
All of us are Kevin all the time

835
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,696
I'm at anything our worst and our best behavior

836
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
That everything we choose

837
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
To do

838
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Is

839
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
In some sense

840
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
Chosen for us the if you knew enough

841
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Stuff about

842
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Anyone

843
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
You know what they're about to do next

844
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Yeah

845
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
No

846
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
No

847
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,016
But I readily admit I flag in Plano

848
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Get on board with this

849
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
This

850
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
At least we've done it in a few round

851
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,256
What is we are able to do it when you look I'm teen and I don't want to be a futurist here but

852
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
When you look 500 years ahead

853
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
Let's say that the things keep progressing in the way that you imagine where we just keep etching liked or chipping away at the sides

854
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Definition of will

855
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Free will

856
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
What

857
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,944
Do we do in that point do we not hold anyone accountable for anything but we simply

858
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Prescribed

859
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Treatments

860
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
What what is that world look like to you

861
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Treatments and or constraints

862
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
You fix the things you fix

863
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
And the ones that can't be fixed

864
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,072
You can stream things of the damage can't be done

865
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
But it's done in a

866
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
And Away a car with

867
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Broken brakes is incredibly Danger

868
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
Happy on the streets

869
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,640
And if you can't fix the brakes you put the car in the garage

870
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
And

871
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
You intervene

872
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,343
But you don't invoke a concept of punishment of the car in there

873
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,463
And if at that point you say oh my God that's so dehumanizing to be that mechanistic

874
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:13,375
That's a hell of a lot better than sermonizing people into having free will over stuff that they have no control over

875
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
We've done it

876
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,495
People with treatment-resistant epilepsy

877
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
You're not allowed to drive

878
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,847
But you don't sit there and say

879
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
They deserve

880
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
Not to be able to drive you don't get like moms of corydoras Yahoo peasants cheering

881
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
When is the driver's licenses are burned

882
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
No

883
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,439
It's not their fault that they have this thing called a seizure

884
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Nonetheless

885
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
If it's uncontrollable they shouldn't be driving cars

886
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,655
And we have a therapeutic intervention here that's completely outside the realm

887
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
A blame

888
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Justice

889
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Deserve

890
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Anything like that

891
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Let's go back to camp

892
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
At the end of the story

893
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Pat ass

894
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,223
Kevin what what what since he makes of his

895
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Punishment

896
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
I assume a that you wouldn't have punished him

897
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Right

898
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
You would recommend

899
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,487
But you notice what Kevin says Kevin says

900
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Well I thought the judge was

901
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
Was a good judge and was

902
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Fair Fare he called her Fair

903
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
So isn't it

904
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
Troubling to you

905
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
That this person

906
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
Somehow

907
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Was able to

908
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Somehow

909
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
Feel blameworthy

910
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
I guess

911
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
But what this justice system is doing is it sort of saying

912
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
You were bad

913
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
Maybe I was

914
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,159
I feel sorry I've got remorse

915
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
That's okay

916
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
And now we give you

917
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Your freedom

918
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
But there's been a

919
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
It's been a conversation here

920
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
About

921
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,471
You are morality you're in a morality but you do not spare only want to have

922
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
I wondering whether that's a healthy

923
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
Healthy

924
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
Mental healthy healthy or slightly healthy oil bad by saying thank you to your to your

925
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,575
What's your shirt of choice

926
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,671
So there is some human need here I don't know where you might quote by Logic or not but

927
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,511
There's something's justice system is addressing that you seem to be

928
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
You seem to be taking out of the system

929
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
Yeah

930
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
Punishment is pleasurable

931
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
It feels good to do the righteous thing

932
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,335
And it feels good to do that in a punishing blaming way

933
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,663
If you're brought up culturally as most of us are too

934
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,711
Have this notion of like

935
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Agency

936
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
But I think I think of what Robert Mike

937
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,575
Did this Robert krulwich Robert

938
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Might be

939
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
I think Robert let me know if you if you if it correctly from wrong

940
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:51,071
Is it it doesn't just feel good personally it's good for Society on some level

941
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,935
Do we want to live in a society where the concept of justice has been tossed out and more in a mechanistic

942
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Take place

943
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
Well how about taking it further

944
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:05,151
Don't we need to have belief in a moralizing and punishing God because why else would people be nice to

945
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
To each other

946
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
I don't need to take it all the way there

947
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
In their wake God like that they rule over us I wanted to say

948
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Setup.

949
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
You're right they work better as soon as you introduce the possibility of punishment in two economic games you

950
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
You evolve cooperation

951
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
You do cross-cultural studies and the more there's a belief in a punching Hell in a culture the more generous people

952
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,591
Foreign economic games yes that stuff works

953
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Yet

954
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Over and over

955
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,199
We've learned at least one domain

956
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,271
Where we step outside of all of that

957
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
The epilepsy example

958
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,391
When nobody thinks of it in terms of it being like

959
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,463
Justice is being meted out when the driver's license

960
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Being taken away

961
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Yep 500 years ago

962
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,935
Somebody who would have been just as smart and chest is introspective in chest is reflective and maybe even had like a

963
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,751
Nice bleeding-heart liberal NPR tote bag

964
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:09,151
Would have said if you're sad about this but that you told them to

965
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,551
Oh my God I thought we were on fire and that person nonetheless would have said this is tragic and

966
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
I feel so sorry for their family and all of that

967
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,415
But who told them to go sleep with Satan

968
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,279
Waylon living this way is there anything in the Kevin patch

969
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,839
Walter store is there anything anyone in there

970
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
Who is being

971
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Harmed ore

972
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,959
Hurt by what you heard now

973
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Well

974
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
He's paying a price

975
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
His wife paid a price

976
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Shame

977
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
Imprisonment

978
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,991
The terrible price here

979
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
For what was simply

980
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
The biological problem

981
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
Still very hard to imagine

982
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
A world in which

983
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
You don't get pissed off at people who do like

984
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,703
Crummy thing and where you don't feel vaguely pleased when somebody says well nice t-shirt so what you just said is that

985
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
The feelings that you have about

986
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
The story of the

987
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,663
Lost to her of her husband

988
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
I love

989
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Shame of being put away for awhile

990
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
You think that

991
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
Later on when the

992
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
Deeply

993
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,463
Biological explanation for this gets fully revealed

994
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,047
In a hundred years say people will be able to listen to

995
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
The story we just heard

996
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
I'm think

997
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
If they only knew

998
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Absolutely

999
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,455
Big thanks to Robert sapolsky for

The biology of humans at our best and worst

1002
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
Which has

1003
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,767
An extended argument about how there's no such thing as free will definitely worth reading

1004
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
Call behave

1005
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,119
