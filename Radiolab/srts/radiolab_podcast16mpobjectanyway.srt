It's also filled with people stories in judges

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088

00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
By the way since so many people have been writing all the time about what's going to happen to the market

United States

30
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,256
United States

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,504

00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,832

Cinemark place

36
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Set table for you we live in a representative democracy

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
What does that actually mean practically speaking when do we come in contact

38
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
52 places seems to me

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
One when we vote

40
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Right yeah you asking me

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
I was deep in thought

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
If you vote if you've always too I know like

43
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
College-educated super Progressive human beings were like why would I ever voted to the UN

44
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,256
Just don't even care about the world makes my point like voting is the first way in for a lot of people

45
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,608
Entirely optional the second way is not you will be fine if you don't do it

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
And I mean

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Serving on a jury

48
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
This is where I like We the People decide

49
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,128
Who goes to jail who gets free who lives who dies which is where we actually do

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Democracy

51
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
Today we start with the story of a guy who

52
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Spring who is Supreme Court famous

53
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952

54
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Battle about

55
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Who gets to serve on juries

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
And his name

57
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,168
Finding out who you are either symbolizes the best parts of American democracy

58
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Or the most cynical

59
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240

00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
And then one of those small in that cases

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Became I think

138
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
American legal

139
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
They got me out of car

140
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
92 cops pulling over

141
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,919
Pull me out the car they say you have the right to remain silent anything and went through that little

142
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Protocol whatever

143
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
They tell him some burglars that happening at area

144
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
I think they said I did them

145
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
William

146
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Yeah I would

147
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,231
The time I've been doing some margaritas or whatever but anyway

148
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
James said he didn't do this one

149
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
And if they didn't have the proof

150
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
He was driving around in his car

151
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,495
And they pick them up when they arrested me I'm thinking they didn't really have a case against me they didn't catch me breaking into a house

152
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
You got me out of car

153
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
An old fingerprints nowhere

00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
He thinks he can win

155
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
Okay so I'm not going to jury trial

156
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
And

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
The mere fact that you and I are talking about

158
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
James Batson

159
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087

Become a lawyer James's case was in the first 6 months

167
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
That I was in the prosecutor's office

168
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
Pretty impressive first year

169
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Starting out

170
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
I lost my first date trials

171
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Really

172
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Batson's case you know this low-level burglary of breaking of a house in a purse being stolen he was a go

173
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Maybe this'll be my Wendy evidence

174
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Disappeared that he was guilty of the crime

175
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
James was

176
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Accuse not data Fighters the one is having done it

177
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
Eyewitnesses they're saying James these Witnesses photos of him before

178
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Because

179
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Do you need naps

180
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
So

181
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
To come to the case

182
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
It goes to trial

183
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
And

184
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Had a hung jury

185
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
They end up being a hung jury

186
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Hip hip hooray

187
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
It means they can come to unanimous.

188
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
James gets off

189
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
Why is it a hung jury in Kentucky you have to have unanimous

190
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
So the defense is looking for that one juror that keeps from convicting

191
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
There is apparently one jar

192
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,567
Who just didn't buy it then by the evidence and thought James was legit

193
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
It was a black

194
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
One black lady came to visit me

195
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
After Drew's over

196
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,991
She said I really really don't think you're guilty the rest of

197
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
The jury

198
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Was trying to make me say that you

199
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Guilty and I was saying not guilty

200
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
So end up being a hung jury at was

201
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Disappointed

202
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
At that point I was

203
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Having sex

204
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Thoughts about

205
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Is this the right career for me

206
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
SoJO gottman

207
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,191
He says imma try this case one more time it was pretty close to guilty

208
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
I have this one Drew hung it up

209
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
Tell me two or more time and it does something this time

210
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
A little differently

211
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Just a setup as you know when you get a jury summons you go in you're on a jury pool

212
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,927
At the beginning of a trial

213
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
Jury selection

214
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Maybe ask you touching your call if we're both side the prosecution the defense sometimes the judge they get jurors into a room and they start

215
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
Asking lots of questions is there anyone here who has been the victim of a crime

216
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
Victims of crime

217
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
To figure out which jurors do we want

218
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,047
Member of a church pictures do we want to get rid of

219
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
And that's the more important part of this process which jurors do we want to toss off history pool

220
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
So what are the rules to get rid of jurors

221
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
There's two ways to get rid of jurors to get down to that group of 12 in this

222
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
And the first way is called striking

223
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
Cause this type of move to excuse him for causing this time

224
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,927
Tracking for cause is like when they ask you can you be fair in this case if you say you know Noah

225
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
I really can't I really strong feelings about the people or the subject matter

226
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,399
That's a strike for cause or it's like hey that lady who's sitting in the chair of the defendant

227
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
That's some

228
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
That's my cousin

229
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
We grew up together

230
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Don't like conflict Venture Lane, that's my boss

231
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
We go out every Saturday for brunch whatever it is

232
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
You're too close to this

233
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
You can't be fair

234
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Got it so that one's cause

235
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,831
That's pretty much common sense it makes sense to everyone but the second way is

236
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
The heart of this whole matter

237
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
This whole story

238
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
It's called a peremptory challenge

239
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Preempt rear entry

240
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Peremptory

241
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
That's a word depending on how you punch it into Google

242
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
It'll be like that's a type of a son what does it mean what is peremptory mean sound means you get a certain number of straw

243
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
Just to get rid of people you think might not be

244
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Fair to you

245
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
But you can really use them anyway you want and

246
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
But these strikes

247
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
You want to give any reason

248
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
How many days do you get

249
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
So it varies from state-to-state in some states

250
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
20 in other states

251
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
It's for

252
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
In Kentucky then and now each side gets

253
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
88 juror

254
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
That they just get to put the Exxon and say you're not going to sit on this trial

255
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,679
Hooker crook anything and this isn't just some

256
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Weird legal rules we made up

257
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Like 20 years ago this is something

258
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
That has been around

259
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
It's older than America

260
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
Goes back to England in the 11th 12th century

261
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
And before that some say he goes back to like

262
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
104 BC Roman times really really

263
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
And the idea is I feel like the visualization is like

264
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Like a seesaw

265
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Like okay

266
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
We need to get to this perfect group of 12 people and

267
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
You know there's going to be people who are biased either side so each side gets the eliminate people you get three you get

268
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
You get for you get for and then we'll

269
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Come to this balance

270
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Send the jury

271
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
A group of people

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Port going to be fair

273
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Tilted their way from other side

274
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,759
The thinking of the land up balanced yet and also the thinking was that this would give both sides more faith in the process and

275
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
At the same time

276
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Protect both sides

277
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
From

278
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Tyranny of a trial judge

279
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Too much power

280
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Got you okay

281
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
What happens in this case is the second trial begins

282
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Take me to the

283
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Imagine early

284
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah that's that's the first thing that happens

285
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Set a scene from a well

286
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
The only people that were in the courtroom

287
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,591
Were some family members of mr. Batson his attorney a detective

288
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
And me

289
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
And the jury

290
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,991
So the reason we're talking about this case and Joe gottman and James Batson

291
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,831
Is because the next thing that happens is Joe Gutman gets up there

292
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,439
He scans the jury pool and at this point he says there are 13 people left

293
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
For that were black

294
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
9 that were white and he uses his peremptory challenges

295
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
The strike of 1

296
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
2

297
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
3

298
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
4

299
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Black jurors

300
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
They're all gone

301
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Leaving all white

302
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
Do you remember striking

303
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
For minority

304
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,199
Do I specifically remember

305
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
The reason for each

306
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
No I don't

307
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,087
I asked Joe was the reason because they were

308
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
In fact

309
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Black no

310
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
I can see that they were not stricken

311
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Because of race

312
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
And I remember

313
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,583
Specifically that one of the jurors lived in the neighborhood

314
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,935
Is exactly remember what his reasons were for all four black chairs but

315
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,823
What's important for our story is to know that James Batson is sitting there in the room

316
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
As all of this is happening

317
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,223
Just completely destroyed

318
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Jury pool

319
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Damn right I told my lawyer

320
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Objective that you know

321
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Voices violet object

322
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
James said because

323
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Not fair

324
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
He should know it's a long-standing rule he's allowed to do that

325
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Describe what we want

326
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Was he loyal white or what

327
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Hughes wife

328
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
He was white inside nose for people that have just been struck off the journey there by the courtroom was white

329
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
So again

330
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,223
Jo Malone YouTube chicken again

331
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,575
What you mean you can't you work for me you do what I say you just check anyway

332
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
I don't care this long-standing rule

333
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
And he did

334
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
And it all came behind that one objection

335
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
What happened

336
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Is after the jury was select

337
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Dugdale

338
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
James Attorney

339
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Said

340
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
Judge our I want to make an objection

341
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
We went up to the bench

342
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
He said

343
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Your honor you can see there's an all-white jury

344
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
I would like for him to explain his strikes

345
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
But before I could get another word out of my mouth

346
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Judge Ryan

347
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Said Mr gottman does not have to

348
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Explain his rights

349
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
It's not the law

350
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Let's move on

351
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Move on

352
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
So they moved on with an all-white jury

353
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
I got found guilty

354
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
I got 20 years

355
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Yes

356
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
Sebastian goes to prison

357
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Danville Court

358
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
And he said his first move when he got there

359
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Appeal immediately

360
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,135
And ultimately his appeal ends up in the hands of the sky David niehaus

361
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Jefferson County public

362
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Defenders

363
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Office

364
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
Anyhow decide to do something

365
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Ambitious

366
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
What we did is

367
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
We call it taking

368
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
A tour of the jurisdiction

369
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Washington

370
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Khalid

371
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
Healing takes illegal road trip

372
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,407
Sesame house and his team start looking at other states looking at other regions to find out what this is

373
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
The problem

374
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
Elsewhere is this just something

375
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Limited to the South or is it

376
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Something else

377
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
You mean like our people in other places doing what Joe got midday

378
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
French braids

379
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,863
And what he found is that this was happening pretty much everywhere

380
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
So

381
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
The following appeal

382
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Which worked its way up through the courts

383
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
And in December 1985

384
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
Thank you gentlemen the cases submitted to hear arguments next year in Kentucky

385
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Case arrives at the

386
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Supreme Court of the United States

387
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
I get a call one day

388
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
From the Associated Press that showed up

389
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
How do you feel about the

390
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Supreme Court accepting

391
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,839
The case of James Kirkland Batson and I was almost speechless and

392
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
I did

393
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Go just to observe and learn

394
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
Mister chief justice and may please the court

395
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
So here's an ultimately went down

396
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
Bat inside my house

397
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
He argues that these strikes were being used take black people off

398
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
Jerry's and this is happening everywhere able to list some 25

399
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Jurisdictions and

400
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
Practice violated the 14th Amendment which is equal protection

401
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
And the 6th Amendment

402
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:15,679
Which is the right to a jury of your peers as representative of the community as possible

403
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,263
So if Lewisville is like 17% black

404
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Detroit probably be about

405
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
17% black

406
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
And

407
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
The prosecutor shouldn't be like

408
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
Askew that without having to give a reason

409
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
First of all

410
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
Kentucky's response to report

411
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
We Believe

412
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,207
The historical nature and function of the device itself to Kentucky saying

413
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,815
We shouldn't have to justify these strikes the court has told us that again and again

414
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
Is always been unsettled enough controlled by the court

415
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
Unexplained and his practice

416
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Centuries and

417
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Yes and maybe some of uses but this is a tool that lawyers need

418
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
Thank you gentlemen McKay's this semester

419
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
4 months later the court delivers

420
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Its verdict

421
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
And in a seven to two decision

422
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Batten wood

423
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,999
The court found that the prosecutor's actions for sure violated the 14th Amendment

424
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
They said racial discrimination of any kind in jury selection

425
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Is not allowed

426
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
Que Dan Rather Bhai courtroom today it is illegal totes illegal even on a Grand Prix challenge it is

427
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,615
Is it illegal for a lawyer to reject a juror on the basis of race

428
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,175
James Batson sentence with immediately vacate

429
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Can you send describe them

430
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
If you were in prison and you know your sentence is being

431
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Take it away

432
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Talk to break every now and then

433
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Discount fishing come up

434
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Just be hanging out playing chess

435
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
I got a law in the logbooks Batson rule

436
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
And that was the biggest deal

437
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Of all this

438
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
The headline

439
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
This new

440
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,847
Rett syndrome named after him

441
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
Justices put new limits

442
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
What is called freedom to re-challenge the Baton Rouge the Bat signal is an echo of what James did in court that day

443
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
You see people minorities getting booted off of a jury you can say your honor I think that's an option violation

444
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255
In the other side B of the defense of the prosecution

445
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,327
Pastor provide non-racial reasons

446
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,911
For why they eliminated that you're in for a lot of people this is a break

447
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
This is like finally we figured out how to do this right

448
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
There was a system in place to protect everyone and that system was even extended to civil cases and eventually the women is

449
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,527
It was a big deal when the case was decided and the initial elation

450
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Was quickly

451
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Tempered

452
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
With a strong dose of reality

453
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,047
This is Jeff Robinson he's a director of the ACLU Center for chest

454
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
Because what bats and prevents is

455
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Deliberate

456
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Racial

457
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Discrimination

458
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
And I almost immediately

459
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
All over the country

460
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
Prosecutors started training each other teaching

461
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
Each other on how to get around Batson

462
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,015
That's fine Simpson he's the director of the Equal justice initiative

463
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
In Montgomery Alabama

464
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Are there a train is all across the country

465
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Do some of these are on video

466
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
And I found one

467
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,328
Music on YouTube you got to stay these basic rules this is one of those videos this one

468
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
In the Philadelphia prosecutor named Jack man lecturing to a room full of young prosecutors on how to pick a jury

469
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Selecting black

470
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
You don't want the real educated ones and my experience black women young black women are very bad there's a

471
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,552
Antagonism I guess maybe cuz they're dancing to respect women and their black sand

472
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,952
So there are downtrodden to areas and they somehow want to take it out on somebody and you don't want it to be you

473
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,632
The crazy thing about this video is that it was film just a few months after the Batson decision

474
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,216
Batson vs Kentucky I'm sure you've all become aware that case

475
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
Jack man basically tells his prosecutors look we got this new rule

476
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,664
Here's how you break it you strike the black person off the jury but just say it's for another reason

477
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
Because that's what Batson required

478
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,088
This is a racially neutral reason

479
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,160
When you do have a black shirt you question them at like and

480
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,048
Honest Little Chute that you have Mark something down that you can articulate later time if something happened

481
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
Black

482
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
Start with first three people write it down right then and there I'd rather ride in my little box there you know the woman had a kid

483
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
About the same age as defending and I thought you'd be sympathetic to a more

484
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
She's unemployed and I just don't like unemployed people because I find enough today before this is almost this training to create

485
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Catalog of reasons

486
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,136
Put on the face where race-neutral just say you're excluding them because they are too tall

487
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:58,048
Are there two old that person was wearing a black sweater things like well he lives in a bad neighborhood

488
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,656
Person would maintain eye contact body language or they belong to a church

489
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Tattoos

490
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
What are a nurse

491
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
Any of those reasons have a markdown

492
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,872
As long as a prosecutor doesn't say I excused that person because they're black

493
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,176
Batson says it's completely okay

494
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,064
I was actually working on a case this is lawyer Bryan Stevenson

495
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,672
My office said the time was called the southern Christmas defense with Jesus and I was in Atlanta Georgia

496
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Before I move track

497
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Alabama and when was this

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
This is 1986

499
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,608
And we were defending someone down in Swainsboro Georgia

500
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Guy by the name of Gamble

501
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
And the bathroom decision

502
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Qingdao

503
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,104
I and objections were made with the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes

504
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Exclude all of the African-American

505
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,736
And we said wait a minute you're on if there's a new decision Batson vs Kentucky

506
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
Which means that the prosecutor can't do this

507
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,160
And the courts at while I read baton. What this means is that the prosecutor has to give race-neutral Visa

508
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
I've got my race-neutral Visa

509
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
Is Weis truck this woman

510
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,144
Because she looks just like the defendant there was an African American man to wait a minute what is that

511
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
No she doesn't

512
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
He said he did

513
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
What struck this man because he lives in South Winnsboro

514
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
And that's where the defendant

515
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,248
And we record the sale of all the black people live in South Waynesboro

516
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
All the way to

517
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,832
That's not a reason to reason. You know that is a recent movie

518
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Pizza Hut stock one person

519
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
Because this man was in the military and he was discharged

520
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
After 5 years in the military

521
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
And in my experience your honor

522
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,656
You only get discharged honorably after an even number of years

523
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
What a juror was put back on the Stanley Cup

524
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,312
Were you discharged from the military honorably yes I was I was actually decorated

525
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
I got this medal I got this award I got these things

526
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Well I still accept the Prosecco

527
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Just waiting for excluding that

528
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
My personal favorite was

529
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,368
The prosecutor said it gets better

530
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
This man because he testified

531
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
That he was a mason

532
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,304
And he said you're on I just don't want anybody who's a member of a masonic lodge

533
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,144
All my jewelry they have their own code their own rituals are all culture

534
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
I don't want that

535
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,776
The jury was put back on the stand we acid or are you a member of the Masonic Lodge

536
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
Watching the tree said no I'm not he said I'm a brick mason

537
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,480
And the judge says I still know what you mean I'll let you exclude that person right

538
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,064
And so almost from the very beginning there was this

539
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
Cynicism this gameplay I used to tell people

540
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,720
Bath is not going to eliminate racial bias in jury selection

541
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,304
But it will make the jury selection process a lot more entertaining

542
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Y'all should come to court and just watch the show

543
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
So you not only did Batson

544
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,080
Not change anything but that's in made things worse

545
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:55,712
As one lawyer Steven breit put to me what bad son is really is basically

546
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
Set of procedures to sorta legitimize and cover up the race discrimination that's going

547
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Going on

548
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
You had this

549
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,768
Smelly putrid problem of racial discrimination in jury selection

550
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
And instead of

551
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Tossing it out

552
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
We just

553
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Sprayed Febreeze

554
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,728
He just kind of perfumed it vaguely she cologne it's still there

555
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Begley hidden

556
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
And now with the Batson rule

557
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
If you think the prosecution or the defense

558
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
Is striking people off because of race

559
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
You have to call them out and then you have to

560
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Somehow

561
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,112
Try and prove that the reason they're providing is a lie

562
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
And that's

563
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Really really tough

564
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Since

565
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
1986 Ford xample in the state of Washington

566
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
There been

567
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
Probably 4748 challenges on Batson issues where people have been convicted make sad waiting

568
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
The prosecutors were excusing

569
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
People of color from the jury

570
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
Because they were people of color

571
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,968
Out of those 46 250 challenges there's been one

572
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
River

573
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
The state of Tennessee has not reversed a single case

574
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Under Batson

575
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,928
And the 30 years for it it's inside the Baton decision came out

576
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
As a result

577
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,328
He says there still many counties in America where the diversity of the jury is not increase

578
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Very much at all

579
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,728
So for example in one Louisiana Parish they looked a felony cases

580
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Is over an eight-year period

581
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
And found it nearly half the black jurors

582
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Worst truck

583
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Houston County Alabama

584
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
Over a five-year period

585
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,528
Data stops at 80% of the African Americans qualify for jury service

586
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Restaurant

587
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,392
80% 80% and that's in debt

588
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Panda cases cell

589
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean if you think about that like a big percent of time Deezer

590
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Lawyers who are

591
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
Going around the Baton Rouge going on the law

592
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Corn on the cob

593
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
Tuition to get these all-white juries

594
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
Who are then oftentimes pudding

595
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
Black

596
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Mint

597
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
To death

598
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
And

599
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
That reminds you some pretty dark

600
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Super basic

601
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
I mean

602
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
That video

603
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Training video

604
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
The assumption that video is it

605
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Having black

606
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
People on the tree

607
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
It would hurt that guy

608
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Would hurt the

609
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Yeah

610
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Show me Justice

611
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Assume that or is there any

612
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Any data that would say that's even remotely

613
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
Betru the hardest thing about looking at this stuff

614
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Analytically

615
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
The juries are like

616
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Black Box

617
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
They don't let

618
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Journalist

619
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Akademiks

620
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
In off

621
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Study

622
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
What's going on

623
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
The jury is kind of sacred.

624
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah but

625
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
The few times we've gotten data like that is

626
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
This group called the capital jury project that looks at

627
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Data speed

628
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
SafeLink application

629
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Because that's where the stuff ends up

630
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Living life or death

631
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
So they looked at data in

632
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Like 350 cases in 14 States

633
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
Over a number of years and they found that

634
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
White man

635
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
Are more likely to go for the death penalty than black men

636
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,336
When you get to sentencing that number that the difference between white and black it's really exaggerated like

637
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
White men are

638
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,176
Are seven times more likely to want the death penalty

639
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Black person

640
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
There's another study that was done in Florida

641
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,832
Amazon look at felony cases over like 10 years and

642
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
They found them

643
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
All-white jury pools

644
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
In Florida convicted black defendants

645
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
16

646
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Percent

647
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
More often

648
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
Okay but was really interesting like that that cap was practically eliminated one at least one member of the jury pool is black

649
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Interstate but one black person

650
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
And that difference

651
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
Catastrophes

652
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Why I mean

653
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Oxycodone cases

654
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,176
Usually involve cops and reason is often cited as

655
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
That nope black

656
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Jurors are less like

657
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
To believe

658
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Cops

659
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Bikers are more likely to

660
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Insert some sense of

661
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Suspicion

662
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Into

663
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,768
The Estates are the Commonwealth or whatever is testim

664
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,072
And almost everyone talked to

665
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Gave me a version of this

666
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
That that you know when you're blocked going to jury to deliberate more

667
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,264
And that black people are less likely to trust law enforcement especially

668
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Jack McMahon

669
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
Who was the guy we heard from in that video

670
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Anybody knows me knows I am

671
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Anti-racist

672
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Person that

673
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Could ever imagine

674
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
Stone Cold liberal

675
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,672
To the nth degree but I was talking about practicality

676
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Jewelry box

677
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
I still stand by that

678
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
If you're prosecute

679
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Let me ask you this

680
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
And you're trying to drug test

681
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,496
And the defendant is going to claim that the

682
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
And you're the project

683
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
What

684
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Demographic

685
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
The group has had more

686
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Bossier

687
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
The police live

688
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Then

689
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Minority

690
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
They have seen

691
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Police

692
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Lima believe police

693
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
Live more than

694
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,072
Some white guy lives in a rich area believes that police officer every guy everything he says

695
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
And so is the prosecutor you're trying to win the case

696
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
And that person is not going to be

697
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
The person is going to

698
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Questioning

699
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Witnesses

700
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
And you're given the Opera

701
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Opportunity

702
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
True peremptory challenges to strike them why wouldn't you

703
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Give me a full mattress

704
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Well I guess

705
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,760
I see the argument that you know use your peremptory challenges

706
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,624
Is to get the best year you can to win but doesn't eliminating a black

707
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,464
Jerry because you believe they might have certain biases against app

708
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Police officer versus a white juror

709
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
In some way violate

710
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
The equal protection clauses

711
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
The 14th

712
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
I don't think so

713
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,008
Not at all because it's not because of

714
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
The color of their skin

715
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Cause of there

716
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Demographic

717
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
And where

718
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Kool-Aid

719
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Societal demographic

720
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
The fact of life

721
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,344
I think those Facts of Life in those societies

722
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Demographical Concepts

723
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
All stem from the color of

724
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,256
Their skin

725
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
Maybe a deeper issue that we can't deal with

726
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
But you're right

727
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
But the reality is

728
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
The reality is that that that that's what this

729
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Situation is so

730
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
So you're saying that if you're the prosecutor you

731
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
You should take out for this guy probably worse

732
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
For me he probably

733
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,456
I believe those cops are line but I'm going to take him because I want to uphold the

734
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
There is no prosecutor in the country

735
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
I want to I want to show my altruism

736
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
And I'm going to keep this guy on my

737
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Jewelry who made this

738
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Believe my

739
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Because I want to be altruistic

740
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
The way life is

741
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,480
How to solve a problem like Batson

742
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
More perfect will continue

743
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,696
This is Albert Einstein College

749
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,128
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

750
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
And I'm here because I need your help

751
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
And I've requests

752
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,648
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

753
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,720
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

754
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Childhood brilliance

755
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Basically I want to hear about this

756
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
Times when a kid you know did something

757
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
It just means you lean back and say whoa

758
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,336
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

759
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons

760
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,992
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

761
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,856
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

762
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

763
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Have anything to do with the test

764
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,352
If you have a story with us

765
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance

769
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Thank you so much

770
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
This is more perfect miniseries about

771
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
Explain how we got into this whole morass

772
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
It's about

773
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
Racial bias in juries

774
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
I think we should

775
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,800
It's because of a case that was in front of the Supreme Court this term in case 1483

776
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
349

777
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
Foster versus Chapman

778
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,944
So basic facts this is a murder case in Georgia

779
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
A younger black

780
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Man kills an elderly white woman the prosecutors dismiss

781
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
A bunch of black jurors

782
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,184
Is and the defense having this new Batson rule says hold up

783
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Can't do that

784
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,816
And prosecutors give these race-neutral reasons and the judge says

785
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
That looks good to me

786
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,240
Years later something sort of incredible happens through like one of those Freedom of Information Act

787
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Type

788
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Things

789
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
The defense

790
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Actually gets

791
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
See

792
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
The notes

793
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
The process

794
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Can had

795
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
During the

796
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,712
Trial the notes they kept during jury

797
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:37,600
This is one of those rare times when we pull back the curtain and we find out what the prosecutors were doing

798
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
This is lawyer Steven breit he actually argued Faust

799
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
After case in from the Supreme Court late last year

800
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
And he says what you saw these notes was that the process

801
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
Xcution they literally wrote

802
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
A little B next to the name of

803
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,776
Each and every black juror B1 B2 B3

804
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:02,176
Highlighting all the black sand in in green on the list of all the people summoned for jury

805
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
Racial discrimination is really hard to prove

806
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
This is actual physical proof

807
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,648
Violin the state like this is the Smoking Gun

808
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
We've been waiting for so what are the what are the prosecutor how did the prosecution argue this in front of pink car

809
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
Once an ultrasound they said

810
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
We were just running those bees because we wanted to make sure we noticed

811
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
The black Jersey you want to keep

812
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Track them

813
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
4 months

814
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
Prior to trial defense counsel

815
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,688
We're filing a bat

816
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
That's the lawyer representing Georgia Beth Burton

817
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,856
And she saying of course we're going to notice race this is the post Batson world end

818
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
We're going to no trace and we're going to write it down

819
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,304
I would be more surprised quite frankly if there wasn't some sort of highlighting or

820
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,912
Is that is that the reason he highlighted

821
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,496
Actors in green he being the original prosecutor

822
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,176
Was because he was preparing defense in case

823
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,296
Correct. Justice Breyer asking well why didn't you make that

824
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Argument

825
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Like

826
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
When the case was actually happening the years and years ago

827
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
What isn't surprising

828
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,096
But he never thought of it

829
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,704
Didn't tell anybody

830
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
I would say that's on

831
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
The good news is that

832
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,016
In a 7 to 1 decision the Supreme Court agreed

833
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
That this prosecutors reasons War

834
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,392
Utterly ridiculous

835
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:52,256
I'm just going to ask you is in this is clear that's in violation

836
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
That's Justice Kagan

837
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
Is that

838
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
This case was in front of supreme court at all

839
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,544
Good at to get appealed up to the highest court in the land

840
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Before someone said

841
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
Oh yeah that's about annihilation

842
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
That's how hard it is

843
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,224
And the Supreme Court so it made a force

844
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Full

845
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
Decision 7 out of 8

846
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
They didn't make a new rule

847
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
This is not work

848
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,000
They didn't offer up but that's in 2.0 or they didn't double down or throw it out or do some new rule

849
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
No they said

850
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
This is really wrong but

851
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
Didn't go as far to say

852
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
Oculus doesn't work

853
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
So we still got bad

854
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,056
So okay if we want to diverse juries and we know that bad

855
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Doesn't really work

856
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
What do we do

857
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
So I asked

858
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Everyone I talked to

859
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
That question

860
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Got a lot of different answers

861
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
But this was the

862
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
One and done agency

863
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Margaret is a professor of law

864
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
IIT should

865
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Chicago-kent College of Law

866
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,720
What I'd like the court to do

867
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Is eliminate

868
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,560
Peremptory challenges

869
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
Again steambrite is a lawyer we have to

870
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
Supreme Court gives you these rules

871
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Appropriate challenges

872
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
And it says

873
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
What weight am I

874
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Don't just break people

875
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
Even Jack McMahon the guy from that

876
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Training video he was over

877
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
We've had 30 years of experiment with Batson and it's not working

878
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
We now have to go the route

879
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,376
That Justice Marshall suggested back in Batson

880
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:39,776
So in the bathroom decision you've got Thurgood Marshall like the most

881
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,872
Important attorney in the Civil Rights Movement turn the first black Supreme Court Justice

882
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
Key in the same paragraph

883
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
Call the Baton decision

884
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Historic

885
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
And then said this isn't going to work

886
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
This decision isn't going to do anything

887
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,928
It he was basically a fortune teller he said both those things in the same breath

888
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
In one paragraph he starts about going this decision today

889
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Historic by the end of the paragraph

890
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
You're never going to fix this until you get rid of print through challenge

891
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,776
Set an alarm for 9 breakfast just do away with from three strikes

892
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,128
Constitution

893
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,456
Both sides are denied

894
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
Peremptory challenge

895
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Challenges

896
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
You will have discrimination

897
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,792
What surprised me most in reporting this story is that like I talk to people

898
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
On the left side of the criminal desk

899
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,168
On the right side of the Criminal Justice System ACLU types

900
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
Law professors academics conservative

901
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
Secure is all of these people when you say

902
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,408
Guys we got to get rid of printer towns right almost every single one will say no

903
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
No

904
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,832
That's a crucially important to let you know it's an easy solution just get rid of

905
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Peremptory snow helmet

906
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,768
Italian style are legal editor law professor sunwolf from Santa Clara University and lawyer David niehaus again

907
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
And here's

908
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
One of the arguments

909
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:13,216
I heard if you take these things away all the decisions about striking jurors would be made by the judge

910
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,312
On the question whether Jerrika be fair and impartial and for that to work

911
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
I thought you have to have a fair judge

912
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
And

913
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
There are an awful lot of judges

914
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
Who aren't there

915
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
Here's another argument I heard from Jackie Robinson

916
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Sing from the ACLU

917
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,576
And this is based on my

918
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,136
Experience of 34 years in the criminal justice

919
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,464
Jeff Robinson says if you can find some way to take race

920
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
Out of the equation for entries are

921
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
Super useful

922
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Annie told me about this one k

923
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
Very high-profile homicide

924
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Case in the state of Washington

925
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,264
This case was incredibly complicated and also

926
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Potentially involved

927
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
A course

928
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Confession

929
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
Buy some undercover cop

930
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Sand

931
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
There's a police officer

932
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Surrounded your iPad

933
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
He says

934
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
I can be fair

935
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,575
I know the police officers that investigated this

936
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Pyside worked with him before

937
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
I think they're really good people but don't worry

938
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
I can be fair

939
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
Everything about his back

940
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Was saying

941
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
I do not want this man to serve on this

942
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
But he was saying

943
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
I can be fair

944
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
I could not exclude him

945
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Moana challenge

946
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Call

947
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Why not

948
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
Because he said he could be fair the fact that he's a police officer doesn't mean he can't be fair it isn't saying I'm

949
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:34,111
I know some of these people involved in this case enough to get him dismissed for cause it's enough to get more questioning but how well do

950
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
You know I'm not very well

951
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:41,279
So you saying that case if you said okay. I like to dismiss jurors 17-4 cause the judge would say there's not a wreck

952
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
I don't think any judge in this country

953
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,399
What dismiss that juror for cause

954
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
And so a peremptory challenge is important

955
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
So

956
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,103
Watched more jury selection videos on YouTube than any person

957
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Evershed

958
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
And

959
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
It's this amazing thing where you see these people but not necessarily use

960
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
To being in a courtroom

961
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,087
There's certainly not used to being grilled in public

962
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
500 people in suits

963
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
Take it up there to the jury panel

964
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:14,047
And they got to ask these questions in the trial

965
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
Over and over

966
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Can you return a partial

967
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,543
Yes sir you're like a blank slate you just got to listen to the evidence can you do all that

968
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
Nobody says no

969
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Everyone feels like

970
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,455
Yes I can be fair

971
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
I'm thinking I could I can be totally unbiased

972
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,391
And I think some of them believe that they can actually do this nearly impossible task

973
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:44,255
And others they know they can't but they might say yes anyway anyone who tries the case

974
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Believe me

975
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
Knows the bias Jersey

976
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
Comment they don't reveal things they lie about things for people that when you're crushing them in a jury that you know they're lying to you

977
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,079
Trying to get onto jewelry or trying to get off the jury bias people are being allowed to serve

978
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:03,199
So any tools that can help reduce the number of biased yours and yours

979
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
Is essential to just

980
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
So yeah if you got a really

981
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
Crappie outlook on chores and humans then maybe you need more friend through challenges but the way Jeffrey Robinson put it to me was that if you're using friends WeChat

982
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Challenge the right way

983
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
It forces you to be like

984
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
Equal opportunity

985
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Suspicious

986
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Suspicious of

987
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
Everyone

988
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
And that's

989
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
The only way to be fair

990
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
My parents

991
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,567
We're both active in the civil rights movement in Memphis Tennessee

992
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127
Is active as two people you could ever want to meet

993
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Both black

994
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,735
I would never let my mother

995
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
Set on a criminal defense jury

996
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,623
Because my mother's view about black defendants was

997
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
You're the reason I have to lock the door in my neighborhood

998
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,023
You're the reason that I get disrespected when I go out into the

999
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Community

1000
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
And I'm going to take it out on

1001
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
My father's position would be

1002
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:59,775
I wouldn't believe a police officer if he told me it was raining and the water was coming down on my head

1003
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,823
And so what this is about

1004
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
Is

1005
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Actually

1006
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
Putting into effect what the rules say

1007
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
Talk to jurors and find out what they think

1008
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
But what about Thurgood Marshall's idea that

1009
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
You know if you have learned through challenges if you give people a way to discriminate they will discriminate

1010
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Well

1011
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
I was born in 1956

1012
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,935
It's on 1954 Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the Board of Education

1013
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Which

1014
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Had

1015
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,543
A significant impact on my life

1016
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
Thurgood Marshall was someone that I

1017
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,455
I have respected and someone I admired virtually my entire life

1018
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,807
But I can't agree with him that I want all peremptory challenges eliminate

1019
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,159
And why do you think Thurgood Marshall Justice Marshall went straight to

1020
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,975
No print I think Justice Marshall concluded that

1021
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
He did not have faith in America

1022
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
To be able

1023
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
To make these kind of decision

1024
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,679
And I understand why you concluded that

1025
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
And you do you have that face

1026
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
I still do

1027
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
And how long that will last I don't know

1028
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
But I still do right now

1029
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
Robinson says that

1030
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
To give up on this

1031
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,255
Parentheses is like giving up on who we might be one day

1032
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,071
Because of who we are right now

1033
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
That's conceding

1034
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,471
That we are so divided by race that we will never be able

1035
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
To try and fix it

1036
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
And I'm not prepared to conceive

1037
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
Okay one last thing for my trip to Louisville

1038
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
What's up Shane

1039
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
All right

1040
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
Thunder blew me away

1041
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,487
Banjo getting it I'm a teacher at Central High School

1042
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Also an attorney at law

1043
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,095
I'm James Batson truck driver in

1044
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Construction worker amongst other things

1045
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
I probably should add that on the

1046
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
Former prosecutor of mr. bathrooms case

1047
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
Joe gottman and James Batson those two people whose conflict in a courtroom back in 1983 gave us the bat

1048
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Rock and roll

1049
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
They are now in 2016

1050
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Prince

1051
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
I'll talk to him about time you have to

1052
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Yep we're friends now

1053
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,743
How often is it that a prosecutor becomes friends with someone

1054
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Helps convey

1055
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,887
Not not often I mean retired from a

1056
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
Prosecuting Austin 2001

1057
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
Hit Cena

1058
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
Too many awful things

1059
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:46,687
To make a long story short it was time for me to do something else

1060
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,503
And starts teaching at a high school in Louisville

1061
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
80% black

1062
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,087
Where do we

1063
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Posing drug testing covered

1064
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,439
Jackson

1065
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
Well drug testing in schools

1066
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,815
Seems like a good idea but in actuality

1067
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,679
Tell the day I visited Joe gottman's classroom which is like a full-on Mach

1068
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Courtroom in

1069
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Classroom

1070
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
He's doing his mock trials with a

1071
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,383
I'll be allowed in schools and public schools cuz if no funding

1072
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
When it's all said and done

1073
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
I would prefer to be known

1074
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
More 4

1075
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
The accomplishments in this classroom

1076
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
Jennifer Batson

1077
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,487
As for James at the batting cages

1078
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Eventually

1079
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Illegal

1080
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
Activities

1081
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
Andy Roebuck

1082
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
War on jail

1083
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
Concept

1084
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Me trying to get people

1085
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
Stop doing crime

1086
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,055
And the books actually you how these two sort of met up again

1087
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,407
One day a few years ago James came to Jose school to give him a copy

1088
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,551
He gave me a copy of his book and asked me if I'd look over it I wanted his opinion on it I read the book that night actually

1089
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
50 books into the school system

1090
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
Where is Jefferson County now

1091
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
What happened in the past is in the past

1092
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,863
30 years ago he did what he did I did what I did

1093
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
Let It Go

1094
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,775
As far as a legacy the Batson challenge goes it's really interesting to hear them talk about it

1095
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
