00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
I don't know what's so shocking to me

00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
He said if you wind back they'd gone in his apartment

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
To treat this guy who is on the kitchen floor with

95
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
He said he believes that when they were helping him up

96
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
Scotty had rubbed against his

97
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807

NJ City believes

100
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
What likely happened in that moment is that whatever drug is

101
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Guy had taken

102
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
And now gotten onto Scotty's arm

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,655
Absorbed through the skin into a system

104
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679

00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
But the thing is like

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,391

He just about came off the stage after him and he calls him everything with a sewing machine and a milk cow

188
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
I mean he made up cuss words

189
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
Yeah he's a he's a wiry little Feller

190
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,895
Just hanging around with Gary probably like 15 minutes and then

191
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
Scotty locked in

192
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
Next to me

193
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Guilty

194
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,111
I got to do it this is the EMT who overdosed yeah Scott he's the guy that supposedly overdose

195
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,463
Descendants 50s white hair tall bright blue eyes

196
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
About all of this

197
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
I-Ready New York Times

198
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
There was one night of the story

199
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,703
About 3 EMS personnel

200
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
I don't know if that's the truth truth

201
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Pretty much

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Picked up in-store

203
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Insulin

204
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
I thought there was something unusual about that

205
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
And I was curious

206
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Tahir the real story

207
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Give me just a few minutes

208
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Yeah no rush

209
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Discuss things

210
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,815
So eventually was just the three of us in this living room

211
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
I mean maybe I should preface this by saying

212
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,983
That you can't really understand the story unless you understand a little bit

213
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
About what

214
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
EMS Personnel do

215
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
I talked to some other EMTs the

216
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Told me that everybody has their why

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Everybody has a thing

218
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
They say it's like this is the reason I got into

219
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
This is a business

220
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,183
I would say like a very small percentage like don't have second or third jobs like they don't make a lot of money

221
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
So everybody has his wife

222
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
And so I asked

223
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Scotty what his why was

224
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
And

225
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
He told me the story

226
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
I think it's a really incredible story

227
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
The not only explains

228
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Why he does what he does

229
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
But

230
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
It also explained like why he holds on to certain things

231
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
So

232
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
September

233
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:35,295
Of 1999 I was involved in an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike

234
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
So it's early in the morning

235
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Is raining job during Hurricane Floyd

236
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
You got there for work

237
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Cross country Trucking

238
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
It was a

239
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Freightliner and flatbed trailer with float python it

240
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Barreling down the turnpike with this

241
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
Heavy bloated Steel on the back

242
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,543
And with the weather like disability starts to get bad slowed Motor Speedway down

243
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Probably running the process

244
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
150

245
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
55 mile an hour and

246
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
He comes through this

247
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Construction site

248
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
And something happened

249
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
In the front end of the truck here to pop

250
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
The front tire has blown out

251
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
I basically became passenger at that point there was no key

252
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Stroller

253
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
18-wheeler was like

254
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
Careening out of control down the turnpike in it

255
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Is likes

256
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Skidding across the wet pavement and a Truck lunge to the right it was concrete wall there that had guardrail attached to it

257
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
It knows them to the guardrail plane back across both lanes boktor

258
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
The center divider in the truck hit it

259
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Plowed through the center divider began to like roll over and came down and struck a vehicle

260
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Traveling the other with direct

261
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Gary said he doesn't remember much of what happened next

262
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Other than his

263
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,279
Truck finally coming to a stop after that the next thing I remember was

264
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
Standing on the frame of the truck watching diesel fuel run underneath of men

265
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
How to hear the truck burn

266
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Somehow you

267
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
Most got out of the cab and he's standing on this

268
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
Helluva the cab

269
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
And the truck is on fire

270
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,455
Ilikeweylie standing there like other people were driving down the highway

271
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,807
Stopped and then starts like yell at him screaming at me to get away from the truck

272
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
I got off a truck and I'll look up the road and I saw the other vehicle on

273
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
And I knew then that it wasn't good it

274
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
It was

275
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
It was very destroyed bacon

276
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
What would happen

277
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:33,311
And there was a lady had a minivan I have no idea where she came from

278
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,455
She open the side door on her Minivan and had me sit in the floor board until the ambulance

279
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
After

280
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
I remember looking down at my left hand and

281
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
The back of my left hand all the skin was

282
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Probably hanging down

283
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
HTM 12 in

284
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Where had melted the skin than

285
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Dangling off

286
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Yeah

287
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
I can remember when the ambulance getting there and

288
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
There was a a female

289
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Paramedic

290
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,431
And when she walked up and looked at me I remember her going oh my God I like this ain't good at is it

291
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
No

292
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
She lied to me she said no it's not good

293
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Get rushed to hospital

294
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
If I broken ribs

295
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Massive skin burn

296
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
I do remember him telling me you're going to lose your left hand

297
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
And I told him I said that's not enough

298
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
He started doing skin graft

299
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,887
Took skin off my legs and put on my arms and

300
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Am I bi

301
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
As you can see I've still got my left hand

302
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
The left-handed

303
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
I'm still a fan

304
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
End

305
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
When

306
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
You said it was a couple days after the accident when they told you about the other

307
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Their car

308
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
How did that conversation

309
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
It was an attorney that

310
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,391
Was for the representing the trucking company that I was driving

311
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
What's the one that asked

312
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Ashley told me about

313
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Holiday said hey

314
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Had been involved with the ax

315
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
That was

316
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
I found out

317
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,287
I just remember him walking in the hospital room and he's like hi my name is

318
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Yeah and my name is so and so and I

319
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
What's up I'm going to tourney with representing

320
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Help me that you drive for and

321
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
Will know if you've been informed of this or not

322
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
Street fatality is involved

323
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Oh I hadn't been informed but

324
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Yes I have been now

325
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
When when we started into court proceedings

326
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
That was when I found out

327
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Names

328
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
And where they were from

329
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
They were from Connecticut

330
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
They had been on vacation in North Carolina

331
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,671
Hurricane coming in they were evacuated out of North Carolina

332
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
So they had decided that they were

333
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
Don't travel up into

334
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Pennsylvania and

335
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
Try to to find a place to

336
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Finish their vacation in Pennsylvania

337
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
That's what puts them there

338
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
About to travel to

339
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
2 miles an hour faster

340
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
2 miles an hour slower

341
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
We wouldn't have been at the same place at the same time

342
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Scotty eventually went back to Long Haul Trucking

343
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
But

344
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
He said that he kept thinking about that day

345
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
About that accident that the people who were killed never forgot still

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
I haven't forgotten the other thing that really struck him about that day

347
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Was that

348
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Everybody who showed up

349
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:01,695
True that scene of the fire department BMS everybody there was volunteer

350
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
And that's something he could really shake that people volunteer to come to me and they didn't know who I was thank you

351
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Care who I was

352
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
They they didn't pass judgement on me that

353
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,079
Yeah I was in a hurry riffic accident and I might have been the been the cause of that accident

354
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Daycare

355
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,479
They viewed me as someone that needed help

356
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
And that was all they viewed me us

357
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,927
Scotty said The more I thought about it the more he felt like he had this the sort of debt to pay back

358
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
For the lives that were lost that day or the ones that he

359
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
Then he extinguished in the way that way that he's going to do that has become a volunteer he's going to become one of these people

360
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Help those in need that comes to your head

361
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,823
No matter what and as I say you know the rest is history here I am

362
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,623
So we spent a few days with Scotty falling around on on some of his runs and

363
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:09,023
As an EMT main responsibility is to drive the ambulance but also

364
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
Chris's partner is often J

365
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
2 calls

366
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
Like a three-year-old who's having trouble breathing

367
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:41,023

How many you think you got in there last year

404
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
All last year

405
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,751
People on work release have been picking his up for like the past year it's just

406
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,127
Litter on the highway

Too bad with an Eagles fan

You just can't do it anymore with the way the needles if that's all

411
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
Yeah it's all kinds of marine Niger bottling

00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Pour me another bottle

413
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791

00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
30 + 9

415
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Here's another one

416
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
We got a problem here there's no doubt about that

417
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
There's definitely a problem

418
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
With her when you

419
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
I still got the drugs in there

420
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Huh

421
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
Waverly pattern

422
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
B24

423
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Did it surprise you to find this money

424
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Really yeah

425
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
What did you say

426
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
The heroin problem just started just like overnight

427
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Here

428
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
I mean it was pills forever and then

429
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
And it's out

430
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
Nobody even ever seen a needle did you mean

431
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
And then just out once they were everywhere

432
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
When you win when you start seeing them

433
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,992
But it's been longer than it's been back-to-back two and a half to two and a half years ago and it just

434
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,808
And once it's charging chart to find a river

435
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
So what do you think

436
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
UC

437
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
Tell these needles

438
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
District

439
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Tobias scientist

440
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,096
It's Bistro in families and we have somebody down here just all the time I mean it's

441
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Trilobite

442
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Cheyenne

443
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
I had a very good friend that I lost

444
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
What was Major back lifestyle August

445
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Somewhere I had took him to rehab and he was in there for

446
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
A couple months and he got out and done good and then

447
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Finding that happened to him

448
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
And I was sort of

449
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
The incredible thing

450
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
Is it like everybody knew somebody who had been caught up

451
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
In using opioids

452
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
Somebody in their family end up

453
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
I want to buy a

454
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,544
Like I went to yard sale because I love yard sales and

455
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,872
When I tell the women were sitting there on the driveway what we're reporting on

456
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,224
They they said they had lost neighbors friends

457
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
Mm

458
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,136
Yeah one day when you're down there we had to take a Lyft

459
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Which

460
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,048
Destroyed my left femur I've got a 12-inch plate 10 screws into pins and hold my left femur together

461
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,144
The driver told us how he'd started using pills

462
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
I talked to a woman who work at a thrift store who told me she lost

463
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Cousin to an overdose

464
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Actually Jade told us about a friend of his

465
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
He actually relapse he was in

466
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
He was in therapy

467
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
His sponsor in na Narcotics Anonymous overdose

468
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
I have nobody to go to so he relapsed

469
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Was found two days later in a car

470
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Is pretty bad

471
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
And I would I would assume that

472
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
DMs

473
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Scotty and Jay

474
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Would have seen this

475
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
This shift

476
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
Yes, he told us around 2017

477
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,776
Overdose calls went from one or two a week to 5/6

478
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
One day there was 11

479
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,408
And that was just unheard of in this County it just

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
To have that many overdoses

481
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,504
Because they would treat the same person

482
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
Like five times over a few months

483
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Like this is just

484
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
The job

485
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Right there there to save people's lives

486
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,976
This overdose problem in

487
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
It's sort of like moral calculus

488
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,888
That an EMS person makes when they show up to help a person who who is OD

489
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
It started

490
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
When report started emerging about this new

491
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Drug

492
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
Distracted made it so

493
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Simply coming into contact with

494
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Person like this

495
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Simply touching them

496
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Could quit an EMS worker

497
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Endanger

498
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Wasn't a lot known about it

499
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,904
We got this guy Jason York about it he's the Emergency Management director for the county

500
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
It came out

501
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
The reports that we were getting was

502
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Literally airborne

503
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Have you ever seen it

504
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
What do you think like

505
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Just hearing about it

506
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
What's going through your mind when you hear about it

507
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
World War Z

508
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Walking Dead

509
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
The drug is called Fentanyl

510
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
What is fentanyl like I know that it's an opioid

511
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
What is it like

512
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,296
Talk to a guy about this

513
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
Can you tell me again like who you are and yeah

514
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
I'm in Emergency Physician

515
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
I hear at Hennepin County Medical Center

516
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
I was just a level 1 Trauma Center in Minneapolis

517
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,328
He's also the director of the Minnesota poison control

518
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Sell fentanyl has been around for decades

519
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
We use it almost everyday

520
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
My Hospital

521
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
So fentanyl is an opioid

522
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
It's fully synthetic

523
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Manufactured in Laboratories

524
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Roxanne comes in powder form but

525
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,528
Drug companies reformulated into all sorts of things like fentanyl lollipops

526
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
These lollipops are given to

527
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
The soldiers on the battlefield there's also Fentanyl patches that people wear to get fentanyl into their body

528
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Through their skin

529
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
Oh so you can you can do Fentanyl through the skin

530
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
It's a easy way to

531
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Put something on for

532
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
People with really bad

533
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Pain

534
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
People cancer free

535
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Confuse them

536
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
It just is really really effective painkiller

537
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
Because fentanyl is really really

538
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
I mean a lot of people refer to fentanyl as

539
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
Start of the third wave of the opioid crisis

540
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Just for context mean

541
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,344
What are the first two waves if you go back to the beginning of the crisis

542
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
The first wave was pills

543
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
When I

544
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,792
Early 2000s manufacturers begin flooding communities with pharmaceutical grade opiates

545
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:15,168
Then the second wave was around 2011 when there was a Crackdown on pills and so

546
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,520
A lot of people that were were using Pharmaceuticals began to migrate to heroin

547
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,592
In the Mexican cartels got very good at delivering that heroin

548
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
And then

549
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Round 2013

550
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
3rd wave hits

551
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Worst drug crisis

552
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Ever drug dealers

553
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
People that are selling heroin

554
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,952
Start looking to fentanyl because fentanyl is so much cheaper

555
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
To either make or obtain the

556
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Normal heroin

557
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
And most importantly Fentanyl

558
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,120
Is way more potent

559
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
Is it basically to to maximize their profit drug dealer start cutting fentanyl into heroin

560
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
Problem is that the people who are using they really have no idea what they're getting they think they're just getting heroin

561
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
2014 we started to see patients in our emergency department who were over.

562
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
Ghost with what they thought was heroin that probably turned out to be Fentanyl and more and more people were overdosing

563
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Fentanyl powerful synthetic opiate about

564
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Powerful Ultra potent synthetic opioid

565
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
And there are versions of the molecules changed a little bit and it makes it more potent and by 2016

566
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Even more

567
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:42,208
Used to tranquilize elephants

568
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,768
And are fed most extremely potent

569
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,840
The same size as just seven grains of salt

570
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Could kill you

571
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
John says it was right around this time

572
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
2016 started to be reports

573
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,128
I fall backwards law enforcement and I'm tryna

574
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,712
Trying to hold on to anything I can grass Emergency Medical Services

575
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
My face started on burning and even nurses in hospitals

576
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
I broke out in

577
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,416
Yes we're scribing getting ill when they were

578
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Opposed

579
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Powder that

580
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
It turned out later to be fentanyl or some other type of

581
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
How do you prestige

582
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
How did I hear about it

583
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
You guys

584
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984

00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
I'm a representative of the media

587
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128

And then local Law Enforcement Officers budline please read about

591
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,632
Fentanyl I mean I read about it but I didn't think it would come to a small City like this

592
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,448
Chat with lions

593
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
What's what happened

594
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
Basically I was dispatched to the funeral home

595
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,384
So it's summer 2017 bud got called out

596
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Parking lot of

597
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:11,808
The funeral home by female had passed out in her car when I got on scene woke her up got her out

00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Vehicle notice

599
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,952
She had some brown stuff on her face like a powder substance around your

600
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Nostrils

601
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Search the car and took an Evidence $1,000 in cash

602
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
And

603
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
Several little baggies of brown

604
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
Powder substance that turned out to be heroine

605
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,032
And that same night as he was like back in the evidence room going through

606
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,688
Through the money I didn't have no gloves on when I was counting money even funny started feeling really dizzy

607
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
Think straight

608
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:45,600
Drop the money drove his Cruiser up here into the parking lot of the EMS station and when he pulled in

609
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
He went down

610
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
A couple of EMS were there gave him this

611
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440

612
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Rush me to the hospital

613
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
Had that ever happened before no

614
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
First time it's ever happened

615
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
And

616
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
You know just a little touch

617
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Basically almost killed me

618
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Just a grain of

619
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
Fentanyl got on his skin

620
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,920
He sang that's all it took it like that was that was the story that was starting to emerge

621
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,320
Really across the country that like a tiny grain if you came into contact with it with a tiny grain of the struggle

622
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
Take you down so as soon as that happened

623
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Biscotti weed

624
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Made it

625
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,768
Pact between us to carry extra Narcan in the truck for us

626
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
In case we ever got exposed

627
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Cuz I knew it was here

628
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
In the counting in the city

629
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
Then about a month after that

630
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
Sure nuff chewing on Steel

631
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Struck in park

632
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
Bargain bows

633
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
I can remember coming to

634
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
And being in another ambulance

635
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,992
JP Mascaro either Narcan did stashed away his dose of Narcan and mine

636
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
Because he wouldn't wake up at 4

637
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
The first house

638
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Condell Hospital

639
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,392
Scotty was kept under evaluation for about 4 hours

640
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
And then eventually

641
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Discharge

642
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
The next day it was like

643
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
I was wondering hit

644
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
On the fact of

645
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
No one

646
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
Almost died doing my job

647
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
And that's essentially win

648
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
What began as a call for help

649
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
Became crime scene

650
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
What do you mean

651
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
I will tell you in a minute that's the break hi this is Heidi calling from

652

And I'm here because I need your help

657
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
And I request

658
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,816
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

659
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,888
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

660
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

661
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,568
It just means you lean back and say wow

662
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
How do they do that

663
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
Maybe it was the moment that I

664
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,224
A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

665
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
Or maybe the kid was a piano

666
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,136
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

667
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry

668
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
We're interested in the

669
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Epic moments where

670
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,936
A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test

671
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,240

Chad Robert Radiolab back to Peter and Matt in Kentucky

678
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
Something that I

679
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Kept thinking about

680
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
When are you down there in Kentucky

681
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Driving around

682
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
Was that there is like no Duty

683
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
To render Aid

684
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,584
Even though there are some exceptions and statutes in some states

685
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
For the most part

686
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
There's just no

687
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Obligation

688
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,800
We live in a society where you like do not you can sort of watch a person drown

689
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
And

690
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
You won't be held liable

691
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
You can do that

692
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
And

693
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
That legal

694
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
I just kept thinking about that

695
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,896
Salvation

696
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
So

697
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
When we were down there with

698
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Earl the Jailer in the jail the old Bexar County Jail we just seen the needles and we were coming out to the parking lot

699
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
I go to West Cobb

700
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
And we

701
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Spent probably

702
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Like 2 or 3 days

703
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Trying to find the people who are actually

704
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
In the apartment like a person who overdosed and the other two people who

705
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,448
We learned lived in that apartment at a phone number but nobody was picking up

706
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,520
But bear with arrow and

707
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
I just asked him if he knew this guy

708
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
Scotty Hatton

709
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Is the difference guy

710
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,528
This is a different Scotty Scotty wightman's EMT

00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,880
Seeley Lake overdose exposure

713
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,720
I have lived in the apartment he was there the day that

714
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744

But then

720
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
He was like I can tell you where he is though

721
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
Because it turns out that Scotty had had on an ankle monitor

722
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
An Earl you know he's the Jailer so he just

723
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,560
Play pulls up his phone and looked up Scotty's GPS location

724
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,144
Total. For the TPS showed exactly where he was

725
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,960
If it's old Cemetery

That was like

731
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
25 minutes out of town

732
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,088
Lots of big trees

733
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Cicadas

734
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,952
Amy Scotty was actually out on this riding lawn mower

735
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
And we were standing there talking to his supervisor and Scotty himself like it's off the lawn mower comes over to us

736
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Sunken eyes

737
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,264
Big eyes free skinny guy blue Duke ball cap blue jeans

738
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,640
So Scottie came over is supervisors went on the lawn mower started riding around

739
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
And Scotty

740
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
Immediately started talking to me like he wanted to tell his side of the story

741
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
He said he got sick I'm working online it's like sometimes you can take 24 hours

742
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,632
Oak Tree on a steep slope

743
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:59,520
I think it's very doubtful

744
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,104
Immediately started telling us that he was like suspicious of Scotty Whiteman

745
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
Story Pole

746
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Overdose by touch

747
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
I mean because

748
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
He only touched the my other co-defendant you know and and I had washed him off you know I didn't know

749
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
You're not supposed to wash them on this overdose not but I did

750
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
And this guy trying to say he got infected you know got I could buy carfentanil and they didn't even

751
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
Find any drugs on the saying I found the

752
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
Very little paraphernalia

753
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
But

754
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,824
I know I'm done it's just one of those things I'm going to church now

755
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,664
How do I get this ankle monitor off I'm going to get saved I can't get saved and

756
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
What time are you can't submerge it

757
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
Where you going to get that day

758
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
I got a Freedom Church

759
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
In Mount Sterling gymnastics

760
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,440
Nirvana bunch of people making kind of nervous

761
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,096
We decided meet up with them later because of the lawn mower or cicadas

762
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,424
I said we went to his own Palace

763
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
He was living there he's gotten evicted from is

764
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
Apartment after 30

765
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Love you

766
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
You don't say Ruby ain't you

767
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,296
Is nice to meet you guys

768
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:22,464
Depends got his girlfriend a Jessica she was the other person in the apartment

769
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Fidgets overdose

770
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,840
She was also now leaving biscotti at is on but she didn't want to talk to us

771
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:32,448
So then the three of us sat down on the couch in the living room and Scotty

772
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Just started telling us about his own story

773
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
And

774
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,384
I think his story definitely has it is a very like sort of common trajectory

775
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:45,248
Great Lake where did you grow up with around here in Bath County been here

776
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
My whole life pretty much

777
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,624
Just got to grow up in government housing in a small apartment

778
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
With his sister is Mom she had another husband by then not my dad he's my stepdad stepdad

779
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,144
This guy named Ricky who dated pretty popular in the story a dragon claw

780
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,192
When I call I get home

781
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,776
And I was like 15 16 I'm going to my grandma and

782
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
Love my dad my grandma on

783
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,896
I was in the sports I make decent grades

784
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
Now I don't even hardly go see my dad

785
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
It got him a case I guess he's got several

786
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Charges pending

787
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
So when was the first time you used

788
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,536
First time I ever took narcotics I was 19

789
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,608
He got kidney stones never had a pain worse than that

790
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:38,240
Hurts so bad I was crying he mentioned it to his dad he had a motorcycle wreck kind of messed him up

791
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
Elsa hearing how you can take one of my pain pills it was a Lortab hydrocodone and acetaminophen

792
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
Said when he took it before you felt

793
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Total relief

794
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
That's like to feel and you know makes me feel really really good at getting his medicine

795
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:00,512
Take it and take two or three and then it just you know got to experiment and more and more started using

796
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
Perc 30s for sure

797
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
Definitely flooding into

798
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Places like Kentucky in the

799
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Early 2000s

800
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,984
So this is like the sort of first wave of the

801
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
The opioid crisis

802
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Biscotti said it first

803
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
You would get pills from Friends people at work and then it just you know got too well you know I started buying pills

804
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Crossover

805
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
Probably my mid-20s he started taking

806
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
I'm talking bread right he was talking Freddy was also working in the factory quadrat works at Steel

807
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,704
Call somebody and I've always been that way I don't really want to stay off people feel like I can work to make enough money to

808
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
It was really hard

809
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
I mean I made 5 $600 weekend

810
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,872
Yeah I wouldn't have any left because you expense

811
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
All of it on on pills and he was doing that for years and probably about like 2011 or 12

812
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
Do heroin come around that's when I start doing it

813
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Because it was cheaper

814
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
Cuz it was cheaper and because I was spending

815
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
$8,200 into pills

816
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,792
Just two pills is two pills

817
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
You know you might get a little behind it might not last very long at all

818
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,240
No Friday or $100 heroin you can get a lot more and it's a lot more powerful

819
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
So that it just makes sense

820
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Calculus Heat

821
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,944
He did heroin for like five or six years he didn't inject it but he would do it snort it

822
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
And he says he

823
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
Tried to quit a couple of times but

824
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Justin

825
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,624
Which is probably just an excuse for I couldn't

826
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Al ahed Rock

827
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Complete rock bottom

828
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
Scotty says that was the day

829
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
Of the overdoses in an apartment yet

830
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,584
Can you pick up at some point like where where do

831
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Where is it start

832
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
If I going to have to ask me

833
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,800
What questions on this cuz I'm going to make sure I back from some of it a little bit

834
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Sauce

835
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,407
Ask me again what you saw Jessica

836
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,807
And your son Gabriel Jessica Scott his girlfriend the two of them have a son together Gabriel

837
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
And

838
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
It's her apartment

839
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
And

840
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
At some point Ricky is with you guys again Ricky is the stepdad or like why is he over there

841
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
He's burned all his Bridges

842
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,007
Earned it sounds like he was last living with friends and like that a falling-out yeah seems like everybody else

843
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,103
Sorry giving up on him we felt sorry for him he and where to go so

844
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
You know you can stay here a couple days

845
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
And that was it

846
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
And then

847
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Like I don't know where would you start

848
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
But that day

849
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Really don't

850
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,975
Nowhere to go with this

851
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
I'm trying to not you know

852
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
Red saver

853
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
I think I think last time

854
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
We spoke it was like

855
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
At some point

856
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
You noticed Ricky

857
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,567
Like I can go from there probably little bit

858
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
You know

859
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,991
Tell Scotty play newest dead he and Jessica were in the living room in the apartment sitting on the couch

860
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
And at some point Ricky had gotten up

861
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
And gone into the kitchen

862
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
And

863
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
After the wild Scotty realize

864
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,743
That the kitchen sink the water in the kitchen sink I've been running

865
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
For a while

866
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,423
Why is the water running you know so I go in there cuz it's the kitchen and sees Ricky standing over the kitchen sink

867
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
And he said he looked

868
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Locked up

869
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:28,127
Frozen lake lake is arms were really stiff his fist restore like clenched racing grabbing the countertop tongue

870
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
Pop my words in his mouth you can come to mouth barely open you can see it I kind of knew what it probably

871
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
Was od'ing I get a chair and I getting

872
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Hey I struggle to get him in it

873
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
A gaming chair

874
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
He's out

875
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
We have one of those

876
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
Not only a fall so young little spray things

877
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
Spring

878
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,191
Yeah I don't spring with cold water or something while you know that might wake him up

879
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
I'm washing in the face and

880
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
I did smack in the face u x

881
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
He just

882
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Are you in like a

883
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,663
So then I knew

884
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
We had to make the

885
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Decision

886
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
To call the

887
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
The ambulance service

888
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
What happens next

889
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,903
I started getting a little bit you know

890
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,975
Out of it I guess I don't remember a lot after that

891
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
So I said listen to the 911 call

892
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,351
And in Scotty didn't really test us and I don't know

893
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,423
I mean it's not that I don't believe him but I do think there was something

894
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
I do think they started like

895
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
In that moment they must have been a little like

896
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
What do we do next

897
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Tuesday

898
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
August

899
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
Mm

900
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
17

901
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
They weren't the first one to call my home on that day

902
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:46,207
First person to call Buzz actually Ricky's brother

903
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:51,839
Which means someone must have called Ricky's brother

904
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,935
Homo is going on they didn't know what to do because when he calls

905
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:02,079
He said something like

906
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
Something about an outstanding warrant

907
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:09,759
Sir like they're worried about outstanding warrants

908
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,855
Outside

909
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Google

910
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:21,535
And then another thing you here in these recordings other call

911
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:28,959
Which is from one of Scotty and Jessica's Neighbors

912
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:35,359
Scotty is a Scotty could come over to her house

913
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:42,271
She made him leave

914
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:48,671
Sounds like their one-year-old son was in the apartment at the timeout wow really

915
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:53,023
They were worried about the police coming in and losing custody of their kid

916
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
And I feel like for them

917
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
In that moment

918
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
What when Ricky was with lying on the floor

919
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
I think there were some questions in their mind like

920
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
What's the right thing to do

921
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
How do we

922
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
How do we do the right thing

923
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Without getting ourselves in trouble

924
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,063
They did make the call

925
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,879
Apartment 301 Jessica called 911

926
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,975
It was two minutes after Ricky's brother made that first call

927
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Goblin show

928
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,655
And I believe one of the reasons that they made the call that day

929
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
Was because

930
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:37,055
They knew about this law I didn't know exactly what it said I did know that it

931
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,407
And came in my mind you will be okay it was designed

932
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
Protect people in exactly this situation

933
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
The Good Samaritan

934
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
Call

935
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:52,159
The Good Samaritan law

936
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,815
Don't round 2010-2011 12 at this opioid epidemic was escalating

937
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:04,959
A lot of states started adopting these 911 Good Samaritan laws

938
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
46 States

939
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
Including Kentucky now have these laws

940
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
Which eventually say if using drugs

941
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
With someone and that person overdoses

942
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,431
We don't want you fearful

943
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,503
If you make the call that may save their life

944
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:22,879
He'll be in trouble at least show up you and the person who overdosed won't be charged

945
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:29,535
Your granted immunity because you essentially did the right thing like you reach out for help or should have like intent of the Good Samaritan laws

946
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:34,399
Make people who are in the presence of a drug overdose do you want these people to call for

947
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
For help because otherwise

948
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
You know

949
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,775
There's a good rest of these people are just going to die

950
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,079
Where does where does the Good Samaritan

951
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,919
Music Christian it is a Christian periobrite we got the Bible right here

952
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
So I'm

953
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Yeah it's a it's a

954
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,807
The parables in the Gospel of Luke

955
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
It's Jesus is telling the story

956
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
And

957
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
So there's a

958
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
That you he's

959
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
On the road to Jericho

960
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
And

961
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
As he's walking along

962
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,863
Some robbers come and they

963
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
They steal his money and they beat him up

964
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
And I leave them in a ditch

965
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
And there's actually left

966
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
Don't forget

967
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
And then

968
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
Another person comes along the road

969
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
And

970
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,407
But is that helping him this person like

971
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
No crosses the road in the

972
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,991
Keeps on walking

973
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
Second person comes by

974
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Same thing

975
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
And then a third person comes

976
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
End

977
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
It's a Samaritan

978
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,719
And like the Jews and the Samaritans were like mortal enemies

979
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Like

980
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
They they absolutely detest each other

981
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,631
But when the Samaritan seizes jue Lan in a ditch

982
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Indeed

983
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
The Good Samaritan stops and he helps

984
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
Help this guy and

985
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
Give them money and shelter in

986
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
And treats his wounds

987
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,151
And you know like essentially saves his life

988
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
So that the story about

989
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:57,343
Like showing kindness to your enemy

990
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
Interesting about this is that

991
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,487
Jesus is talking to a legal scholar

992
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
And

993
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
So it's true about setting up

994
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
I like morality verses

995
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
The law

996
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
And

997
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,079
And so like what I guess what he's saying is that if if you see somebody that's in need you don't think about what the law says you should have

998
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Do you

999
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
You just

1000
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,663
You just help the person in need

1001
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
It's like

1002
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,223
You know

1003
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Unconditional love

1004
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
Like takes precedence

1005
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Over

1006
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
Over the letter of the law

1007
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Lake but then of course

1008
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
There is

1009
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
The law

1010
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Ronnie

1011
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,791
Does New York reporters are here to stick a microphone of your face

1012
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,119
And what seems to be happening across country is prosecutors

1013
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
Are beginning to push back

1014
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,983
Against the Good Samaritan

1015
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Thank you

1016
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Sweet guy Ronnie Goldy

1017
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
Is the Commonwealth Attorney

1018
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,663
He's off the lead prosecutor in the case against Ricky Jessica

1019
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Scotty

1020
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Got this from

1021
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
Adam New York and it's just not something that that I would have expected certain like isn't working for use her own little problems in here and I would assume you

1022
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Got bigger problems in New York to deal with them

1023
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,743
Then what we were dealing with it

1024
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
That's fine I mean

1025
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
Glad that you guys

1026
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Got down this way

1027
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
So what did he say

1028
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
Say to you about

1029
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,471
Asrani starter explained it

1030
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,079
To us to go back with our legislature in and the way they they have drafted the

1031
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,431
Good Samaritan law the way the law is written in Kentucky is that

1032
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,759
If you call 911 for a drug overdose

1033
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,575
You're only granted immunity for

1034
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
2

1035
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Specific types of charges you cannot charge them with possession of controlled substance drug possession or possession of drug paraphernalia drug

1036
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
Paraphernalia just those two charges

1037
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,375
But we didn't charge him with possession we charge them with wanton endangerment

1038
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
In this way you see this sort of pushed back

1039
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Wanted me to take the legal term for when you do something that quit somebody at risk for physical injury or or

1040
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,383
Conscious disregard for

1041
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
What cat

1042
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Credit card

1043
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
It's like driving drunk

1044
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,295
So in this situation with fentanyl

1045
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,599
You created this number one of the child

1046
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,927
I'm being seriously injured or killed by someone overdose or

1047
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,743
What other injuries and then also you placed

1048
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Paramedics law enforcement

1049
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,095
And social workers that you would have to come in

1050
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
And that's that circumstance

1051
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,215
So rather than granting Scotty Ricky and Jessica

1052
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Protection

1053
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Ronnie Goldy

1054
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,799
Commonwealth of Kentucky

1055
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,079
Has charge them

1056
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
With 10 counts

1057
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
So tell me what endangerment

1058
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,455
To each one of them are getting hit with 10 felony charges

1059
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,807
Low white n so there was one charge for endangering

1060
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
The child

1061
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,207
So like the the the 1 year old could have gotten into the drug somehow and

1062
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
And

1063
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
Become exposed that way

1064
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
And then there was

1065
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
Wanted if there are nine additional charges

1066
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
One for each

1067
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,679
Of the the people that came to the house that day

1068
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
The police

1069
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,983
The social workers

1070
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
And all the EMS that responded

1071
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,639
And I think we should stay here that the Jessica who's now facing these 10 felony charges

1072
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
The day

1073
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,991
Of the over dashefsky tested negative

1074
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
For opiates

1075
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,159
But in there getting their kid checked out okay to

1076
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,231
Call she was like in the apartment and made the call

1077
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
The other thing to mention is

1078
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
That like the thing that she and Scotty

1079
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,679
Were scared of which was losing custody of

1080
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
Their son

1081
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
That that did happen

1082
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
I'm not mad about that

1083
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,591
I understand that I understand that aspect you

1084
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
Drug stuff found in the home

1085
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
They took him I understand that

1086
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
As far as the other things

1087
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
10 felonies

1088
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
I don't understand them

1089
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
But Ronnie's

1090
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
Argument is that

1091
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:48,255
Because of the number of people who had been overdosing in the community

1092
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,143
Because of the local and national news reporting about heroin being laced with drugs like Fentanyl and carfentanil

1093
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:58,751
But you can argue the rest that you knew was out there but yet you're using anyway

1094
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
You should know better

1095
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
But it's up to you it's like I don't know I don't know if loopholes the right word but it's like it's a way in which you can still as you said like your preclude

1096
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
Booted from bringing charges for possession

1097
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,319
Of drugs and paraphernalia but like there is a sort of side door be like well

1098
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
We can charge you for this

1099
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,647
Now that's not the case at all

1100
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,743
It's not like we're trying to say okay we don't like to get smeargle always go around it

1101
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,303
And that's not how I work that's not how we work

1102
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,351
The thing I don't understand it seems like

1103
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,215
The net effect of the Good Samaritan laws to sort of reduce fatalities and it seems like

1104
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,847
Rather successful in reducing fatality so you are

1105
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,503
Encouraging people to call nine-one-one you are reducing fatalities and in this case if they hadn't call 911

1106
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
Possible that the

1107
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,087
Ricky Mays the patient would have died so

1108
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,231
In some ways I feel like I totally understand it I don't understand the reason behind it

1109
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
But what I may think morally or personally

1110
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
I don't have that luxury

1111
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:00,703
I have a statute that I have to follow because when I took the oath of office it is it I will uphold

1112
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:06,079
The laws of the Commonwealth and if it's a Crime After Crime I don't get to say well but they were trying to do the right thing

1113
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,895
Life is a crime it is a crime and I have to pursue it

1114
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,247
We actually we talked to another prosecutor mauldin's case

1115
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,783
Kim hunt price

1116
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
Is the county attorney who indicted

1117
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
Ricky Scott and Jessica have people whose jobs

1118
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,999
Are to protect the public who have to be there

1119
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,839
You know the message needs to go out there these people are protected

1120
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
As well

1121
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Pressure

1122
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:37,055
People weren't calling you locally or there wasn't somebody from like the state

1123
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:41,663
Like no one calling from the state or anything like that I mean I just had my

1124
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,967
Local people you know that were

1125
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,807
Concerned about it and was it the people who were there we're calling you early

1126
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,671
I kind of think one of them did call me you know just say is there anything

1127
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:58,303
We can do you know with regard to this is there an appropriate criminal charge

1128
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,679
Believe mr. Whiteman is so dead

1129
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
Okay so

1130
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
My Tata Sky Whiteman

1131
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
We asked him

1132
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
Essentially why was it

1133
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,175
Did he wanted to see these people charged our view it as a call for

1134
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Accountability

1135
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
They're doing heroin

1136
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
Will get out here we'll roll around in the yard for a week

1137
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
I have no issues with that

1138
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,391
But when you do something

1139
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
They could cause harm to me

1140
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
I've got a problem with that

1141
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
I think clay KY

1142
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,583
Understand that but

1143
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
Ultimately also feel like

1144
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
Did they truly didn't

1145
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:42,335
Know that like this is a drug that somebody could like brush up against or something like that and potentially

1146
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
Have reaction that there's

1147
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Just not enough knowledge there for them to

1148
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Have

1149
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:52,063
Even even even a sense of the fact that they could be endangering other people

1150
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,391
And then said he didn't know that you've been through this

1151
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,975
Experience with an accident I would kind of felt like on just surprised

1152
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
That

1153
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
That you

1154
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
What it may be extended them

1155
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
I sort of Lake

1156
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,191
I'm no sympathy the right word but

1157
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
I think

1158
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,519
That if you harm someone

1159
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
You should be held accountable

1160
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,199
If you guys know now that I'm going on vacation

1161
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
September the

1162
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
16th is a

1163
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
The hard day

1164
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,903
That the anniversary of his truck accident

1165
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
Where he killed three people

1166
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,023
That Sunday yes cuz yep

1167
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
So

1168
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,863
Sunday I will

1169
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,703
Probably lock myself in a room way from everybody

1170
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
The biggest part of the morning

1171
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,823
If I'm scheduled to work

1172
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,919
September 16th is the day that I take off

1173
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
From

1174
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,527
From the morning till noon is

1175
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
It's time for

1176
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
Made to pay my respects to them

1177
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
And even though

1178
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
Here we are coming up on

1179
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375
19 years later

1180
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Still do that

1181
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
Just my way of

1182
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,591
Dealing with it I guess

1183
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
What are you doing that moment

1184
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
When you're when you isolate

1185
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,271
One of those that I reflect on that morning

1186
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:31,135
And I still try to figure out if there was anything that I could have done different

1187
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,463
That may have changed the outcome

1188
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,767
What I done

1189
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
May 1st

1190
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,703
I still have nightmares I still wake up in cold sweats

1191
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,799
I'm just with you steam engine is yes

1192
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
Lurk not yesterday me last time we were here

1193
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
That

1194
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
So nicely I think there was a

1195
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,247
There's a lawsuit filed by the family against

1196
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
Company

1197
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,599
But then there was a civil suit that you had to go through

1198
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
Peter benchley bankrupted you

1199
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
And

1200
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
What I'm wondering is Lake

1201
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
Did you feel that was

1202
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
Deserve to feel like that was

1203
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
Justified

1204
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Yes

1205
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,735
I took three members of that family away from them

1206
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
That took potential

1207
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,391
Earnings wife in that family

1208
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,047
Birthdays and Christmases Miss

1209
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,119
What's those that were

1210
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
Tyson that day

1211
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
So yeah

1212
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,007
I feel like very Justified

1213
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,103
I was held accountable for my actions of that morning

1214
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,175
And then

1215
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,759
When you look at the

1216
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
Exposure case

1217
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
She needs to be

1218
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,255
Accountable for those actions because he knew the risks that were involved

1219
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,839
Right just as I think like getting behind the wheel of a

1220
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Truck

1221
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,167
You know on September 16th 1989

1222
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,447
Thank you know that

1223
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
There could be consequences

1224
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
His butt

1225
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
You never

1226
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
If that's why it's an accident right it's like

1227
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,407
The same thing if you'd taken like I don't know

1228
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
2

1229
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,247
2 mg less of the drug it's like

1230
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:40,927
I seem like really they seem like really similar situation the most and I guess I'm just wondering

1231
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
Like what

1232
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Why is it hard to forgive him

1233
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
Don't say I didn't

1234
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
Forgiven for it

1235
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
It's just

1236
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
I think

1237
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,335
They should be held accountable for his actions

1238
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:08,831
I mean like all of that sort of like brings us to the the big question in the story

1239
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,231
What happened that day because if we're going to hold Scotty hadn't accountable for what happened to Scotty Whiteman

1240
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:21,631
You need to be able to show that that the drugs in the apartment or whatever was on Ricky skin

1241
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,423
Like could actually

1242
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
Caused him to overdose

1243
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
Would you have any

1244
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:33,151
Do you have any reason to doubt that the reason I found this story was it was reported as a credible

1245
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Report in the New York Times

1246
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,247
Everybody sort of acknowledge that

1247
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,343
No First Responders were going down all across the country

1248
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
But when I

1249
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,671
Actor John Cole

1250
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Toxicologist from earlier

1251
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
He said well

1252
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,071
I don't doubt any of the symptoms that any of these

1253
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,607
Fire EMS

1254
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
Police officers have

1255
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Experience

1256
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:00,031
He was skeptical not 100% clear if that's

1257
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
Actually due to the

1258
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
Fentanyl

1259
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
Or to some other event that occurred in those

1260
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,735
And John Cole wasn't alone I mean I I started calling like

1261
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,319
Doctors in toxicologist pharmacologist

1262
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,415
And they said the like the risk that fence all posed to First Responders

1263
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
Was extremely low

1264
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:24,351
Why what was there which I think well for one I mean like that the powder doesn't spontaneously aerosol eyes it doesn't

1265
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,935
Don't like proof into the air so that makes like breathing it in

1266
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Pretty unlikely

1267
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,287
As far as the skin to skin contact thing

1268
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,823
So poorly absorbed

1269
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,455
Feel like substance itself doesn't pass through the skin easily to get fentanyl to absorb through your skin

1270
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
You have to use

1271
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
A special Matrix to be able to know if you want to offend I'll pass you have to sort of use the solvent to get the absorption

1272
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
To even be to the point where it's

1273
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Therapeutic

1274
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
Let alone in Alberta

1275
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:58,655
Even if you put a fentanyl patch on it takes it takes a very long time for the drug to sort of like achieve a meaningful dose

1276
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
In the body

1277
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,495
But something is happening to these people I mean after

1278
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
Assume so

1279
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
It's not the drugs

1280
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
What is it

1281
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,223
It says he has he I was John Cole and a couple of other people brought up with this idea that maybe it wasn't that

1282
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:18,623
External situation that they're in there was more it was more something internal

1283
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
One of these people

1284
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,719
Felt symptoms that are very real

1285
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Vedanta the symptoms

1286
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,839
Don't don't really match the symptoms of a typical opiate overdose

1287
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Princeton

1288
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Hyperventilating

1289
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,959
I hope you answer usually beating slower not breathing faster

1290
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:37,055
Or a lot of First Responders reported feeling a sense of great

1291
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Impending doom

1292
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,127
Opiates are all about Serenity and pleasure

1293
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Not impending doom

1294
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,807
And so if you look at the symptoms and started the stories that are being told about these new substances in these new city

1295
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
Situation in our culture right now

1296
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
He says

1297
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,927
Kind of looks like a mask

1298
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,487
A mass panic so there is a condition

1299
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,023
Called Mass psychogenic illness

1300
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,863
This is the thing that John Cole says that he's actually come across

1301
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,423
In his work at the that the Minnesota poison

1302
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
There was a

1303
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
A school event in a bunch of

1304
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
You said that about

1305
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
45 years ago there was this incident

1306
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,407
Republic school in Minnesota

1307
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,223
We're about your kids started like killing over cuz

1308
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
They thought

1309
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,551
It was like carbon monoxide poison

1310
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:24,671
Subsequent student after student begin to feel they took all these kids to the hospital and they live

1311
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,975
Give them blood test none of the blood levels

1312
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
Positive for carbonara

1313
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:33,631
I just didn't check out the medical conditions are are ruled out from unknown

1314
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
Poison

1315
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:39,007
You have to start considering other causes and and that event was consistent with

1316
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,055
Actress condition called Mass psychogenic

1317
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:46,687
Illness when you think about you know First Responders showing up the scene of a drug overdose

1318
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,759
What's running through their mind is this like

1319
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,831
Constant onslaught of news reports another

1320
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
Anecdotal accounts they've heard about their

1321
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,463
They're their friends in their colleagues that are

1322
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:03,327
No passing out it isn't it isn't that anybody's crazy or we gets that

1323
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
Their mind is

1324
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,471
Causing them to be physically ill they really are sick

1325
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,287
But it isn't necessarily due to the thing

1326
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,823
That they believe that it is

1327
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
Does that make sense

1328
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
My response to that is

1329
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,991
So what we knew what the scientist

1330
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,807
And then thing in Sky says basically like look

1331
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,879
They can say whatever they want to in their lives but

1332
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,927
This is what I went through I just know

1333
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
The effects of that day

1334
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
That

1335
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,327
I came in contact with something

1336
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,399
That put me in an overdosing situation

1337
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,271
An inmate at the Clark County Detention Center

1338
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
Kentucky

1339
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,111
Charges for your call has been accepted

1340
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
Hello

1341
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
Hi Ricky this is Peter Smith

1342
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,023
I ended up sending a postcard to the jail

1343
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
Because the jails don't accept

1344
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,631
Letters cuz they're afraid of drugs getting in

1345
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,215
And a week later I got a call from Ricky Mays

1346
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Ricky is

1347
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
Scotty's stepfather

1348
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
And he's also the person who overdosed

1349
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Biscotti white men treat it

1350
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:27,039
And he told me that it wasn't there wasn't a whole lot of Toxicology have an answer medical records or much

1351
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
Anything really better

1352
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,391
He had agreed to a plea deal

1353
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,463
For all 10 wanton endangerment charges

1354
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,791
Yes I played you took 3 years I mean

1355
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,839
Maurice Forster

1356
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,399
You said you were more or less forced

1357
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Yes

1358
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,983
Because where he's at a repeat felony offender

1359
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,031
He was looking at like 20 years

1360
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,567
Instead of the three that he took

1361
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,455
What's the message you're putting out there is if anybody oldies right here or anything like that so mean to ditch

1362
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
Illegal

1363
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,039
Message sister

1364
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,343
Court systems putting out the people

1365
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
That's what I thought

1366
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
How to how does that make you feel I mean is that

1367
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Yeah

1368
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,911
Is it seems like if they didn't call you we wouldn't be talking right now

1369
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
I said if if if

1370
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
If they haven't called nine-one-one that day

1371
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,591
Like the Good Samaritan law assertive says you can

1372
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,663
Doesn't seem like we were talking right now

1373
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
Hayden real thing

1374
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Yeah

1375
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,831
For what they done

1376
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,183
Anything else you ask

1377
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
That's why I just ramble on all day

1378
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,559
I'm like Ricky Scotty has refused to take a plea deal

1379
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
Instead he's going to risk

1380
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,167
Up to 20 years in jail

1381
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,215
By taking his case

1382
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,031
Trial I think about everyday

1383
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
Every day at work

1384
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,151
Fur Elise couple hours I think about

1385
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
And the same

1386
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,247
Same answer comes up every day I have

1387
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,783
I have to take Anadrol

1388
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
I don't I don't want him doing this

1389
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,623
New everybody man

1390
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,439
Let that they're going to be afraid to call 911

1391
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
I feel like for me like

1392
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,791
Give it away it's gone give me the way

1393
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
People and how they think about

1394
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,143
Drugs like I I just I don't

1395
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,471
I'm about to have the same sort of like confidence and conviction

1396
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,079
I understand where you're coming from that's what my lawyer says to

1397
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
Think when a few things comes like you know

1398
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Like

1399
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:37,855
They may say well he did get sick while we're going to stay while he didn't test positive for anyting

1400
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
Could have been something else

1401
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
Every little bit of doubt that you created

1402
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Reasonable Doubt

1403
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,119
And all you got to do is convince one person that Jerry is saying I'm not doing it

1404
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
That's all you got to do

1405
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
Obviously the jury will be making

1406
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
A decision about

1407
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
The case

1408
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,407
In about what happened in the apartment that day

1409
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
But

1410
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,783
I think there's sort of a bigger sort of more consequential

1411
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Message

1412
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,855
That they'll be sending about

1413
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
What people like Scotty and Scotty

1414
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Should believe in

1415
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
What they should fear

1416
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
And

1417
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
What they should do

1418
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
Going forward

1419
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,119
50 charges end up getting dismissed

1420
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
Or

1421
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,471
If it goes to trial in and the

1422
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
People are found not guilty for

1423
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,335
Morning intermittently how are you going to feel

1424
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:38,015
If they're found not guilty then I'm going to trust in the judicial system that

1425
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,391
There was some things that come to life that maybe I wasn't aware of and

1426
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,047
If they're not found guilty then so bad if he goes out and use again

1427
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,863
I'm on shift when it happens

1428
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
I walk in and saying guess what

1429
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,567
What job is to do everything within my power to save his life

1430
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
And that's what I'm going to do

1431
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
And

1432
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Ask the other Scotty

1433
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,623
What would you do would you make the same called you think other people to make the same call if like if this is what's on the end of that call Button

1434
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Actually

1435
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,207
Call Tri do most people

1436
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Depending on how the Arlo

1437
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,535
Trout probably try to just leave the person

1438
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:26,143
Dragon outside or something like that people in jail was saying do that

1439
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Or

1440
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
No cover up

1441
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,519
Everything at the crime scene or whatever you know

1442
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,079
Or just not called and said that

1443
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,407
If I knew that would have been 10 felonies man

1444
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
Amanda Steele got a call the guy can't die

1445
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,647
