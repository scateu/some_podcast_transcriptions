Everybody take a deep breath I had warned them ahead of time that something big was coming

16
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
It's nothing something that obviously

17
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,896
We got over that little bump in the road I just I basically outlined that

18
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
This challenge

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,736
We came up with a little a little plan

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,296
2

21
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
September 27th

22
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Bourbon release

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
A baby story

24

We're seven stories really end between today

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048

00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Sad story

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
You will have that much time to do it

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
I will be putting it up

30
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
In other words

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
We're giving them like a week to pitch a story

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
And then a week to make it about breaking news

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
So something that just happened

34
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Or you just worried about bears

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
So I'm calling the whole thing Bad News Bears

36
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632

Hottest music one of the puppies that's been bothering me

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,136
The length of time it takes it to make these stories sometimes I can feel too burdensome

42
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,232
I'm going to just like do an experiment where we short cut the hell out of that

43
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
This way to put it was just a strange juxtaposition

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
I want you guys to go out now

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,984

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752

Here's your husband go then you're going to get paired up I'll do those pairings in a second

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
That story has to be under 10 minutes

51
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
The story must have some point

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
Include audio from the movie Bad News Bears

53
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024

00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Hit by Hurricane Florence

105
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,335
Homes were destroyed tens of millions of dollars

106
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Destruction

107
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Trees were knocked down

108
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
And with those trees

109
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
How come power lines

110
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
With the power lines down the lights go out thousands of people are in the dark around here about

111

Flooding in Newburgh

112

And we got historic houses that were built in the 70s

113
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
And as director of Public Works it's Matt's job department is

114

Are lined up getting ready to roll out the storage unit debris cleanup

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
But

119
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,951
What we called mad about was the the cleanup of something far smaller

120
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
This bear is not supposed to be here

121
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Far less vital

122
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Right now but I'm sure they'll get them back

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Beef soup

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679

Let me see let me see history grade

126
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:19,039

00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
And if you look up the meaning of burn

130
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Switzerland

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863

138
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
Obsession taking hold is that they have

00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Bear statues

140
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
All over town stand up on their hind legs

141
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,775
Probably somewhere between 6

142
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,431
So that being said you'll bears everywhere including the morning of September 14th

143

By Thursday night I mean it it happened in some places just extremely quick to tell buddy and

149
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
A few other locals

150
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
Took it upon ourselves that we needed to go out and help people and they would go to areas outside of the downtown and they

151
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
They were just banging on Doors

152
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
They look in the next six to eight hours this water is going to be over your head in flood your arm and you need to get out

153
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Now and get you a shelter

154
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695

00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
Yeah they all sit on concrete slabs but

162
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
Deal with the amount of water we received a lot of

163
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
Many of them were lifted cement and all

164
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415

00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Gently set down

180
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223

Saturday morning

192
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
You know the first day that the winds really had

193
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735

My God

198
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
This town has just been destroyed

199
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
I got branches everywhere the rain is still laughing and there was a lot of debris and stuff flying and

200
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
It looks just right in front of him

201
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
Right outside the doorway right there on its side

202
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
Inntravel little bit of a puddle of water

203
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Is a bear

204
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
One of those floating bear statues

205
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Had ended up

206
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Annie's apartment

207
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,647
And he immediately recognizes it as the city hall bear

208
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
So you have on there a lot of the colors and scenes from the city of New Bern so you have on their head back of the bear is

209
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,423
Painted yellow like the New Bern Flags the middle of the bear is painted with the North Carolina

210
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
State flags and then the shoulders and head of the bear are red white and blue

211
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
And that bear represents our entire city

212
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
And there was

213
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Run from my doors

214
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
A gentleman happen to just be walking by in the street

215
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Who was

216
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
Living on a block-and-a-half away from me and he helped me pick the beer out and grab the back legs the other guy grabbed at front

217
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Legs front back whatever they grab the market across this I'm presumed to be probably still 6 inches of water

218
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
Washing through the 3 and then Florence is like not done right cuz it's sad over the coast for a while so the

219
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,079
End of gone down but like the rains are still torrential there's like

220
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,175
I mean flood watch has a week out with it

221
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
And there's a bush right behind City Hall

222
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
With a little bit of an Alleyway in between the bush

223
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
And the building

224
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
So we put the Bear in between they are because we knew it would be hidden enough

225
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah buddy Bagels he took the bareback across City Hall in

226
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,423
Few days later they're actually getting ready for

227
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
President Trump was going

228
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,079
And so Matt montanye head of Public Works

229
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
Goes down to City Hall to like

230
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Parrot

231
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,015
I was asked to go down there and make sure we had a flag on City Hall and make sure was flying high

232
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
We took a couple spot the bear go over to it

233
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Big pick up the bear

234
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
The market to the platform

235
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
Set it back on the concrete pedestal like it was that

236
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,703
Alter screw one side of it into the bear's foot and then put the other side into the concrete slab

237
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
When should do that I'm all for the lights

238
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Step back

239
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
And take a take a breath

240
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,271
And then a raise a new American flag

241
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
And I move on

242
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159

00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Like 10 years plus working for The Colbert Report just basically like a high-rise living city guide

282
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
About a year-and-a-half ago heinous

283
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,271
Spouse can be moved update

284
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
With the rain

285
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
What the

286
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Stuff is happening

287
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
They bought a little white house with a big yard and the

288
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
Beautiful mountain ridge in the distance

289
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Foggy in the

290
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Like a building

291
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
In Manhattan

292
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Cheerleading things

293
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,639
And pretty quickly after they get there they realize there's all this food growing in their yard

294
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Apple trees and then they find a Pear Tree Inn kale and pumpkin pumpkins

295
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
How old is the Garden of Eden

296
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Had you ever had

297
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Trees that grow

298
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
Fruit or food before

299
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
Right in the center of this yard

300
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Peachtree

301
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
And we had so many pieces I think we pulled like

302
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
200 Alta Street Jimmy Jam and Pie and sauce and he's everything

303
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Pie baker

304
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
We had a ton of Pi

305
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Though the next

306
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,455
The next year rolls around and Rob it is like rubbing his hands together like

307
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Yes

308
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
Peach time you know that they're ready because they come off when you gently

309
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
And if they're not coming off yet they're not ready yet

310
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
So it was in the part we were like

311
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Waiting

312
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
And ready for it to start to happen

313
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
When e

314
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Here's Sandy yellow from the back

315
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
At the house

316
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Three jumps up

317
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
Does the back window and and see if it was a bear

318
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
It was a it was a I mean

319
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
You can't mistake it sitting there

320
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Like

321
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Winnie the Pooh on its butt

322
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
And I was just reaching up

323
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,367
All lazy to the train was pulling off a peach and it would like

324
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Look at it

325
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:36,511
How do I put mouth pain with drop it and it would reach up for another one

326
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
It was just time of the time of its life

327
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
And I love that it's sitting

328
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
Not only was it sitting its back was to

329
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Which I found also

330
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,591
Very upsetting in ways I couldn't totally articulated a time I was like you need to be more

331
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Aware

332
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Someone's house

333
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Taking their food

334
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,343
He jumps up he grabs is tearing that he uses to punish his cat

335
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
And I ran outside

336
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
And I started shaking it

337
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
I wouldn't even take a video of it

338
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
And then Sandy his fast is like

339
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
By the house will sing like a dog

340
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
A mic

341
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
Although the Bertolli freaked out it

342
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Booked it

343
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,735
Back into the woods that way they walk up to the Peachtree and Peachtree has been

344
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Like Matic

345
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
The parts of the tree that are

346
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
60 below

347
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
We're pretty much

348
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Stripped

349
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
Peaches are there just always Peach pits and like half-eaten peaches got it around and every one of those is like a

350
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,887
Repeat that they're not going to have like a pie crumble they're not going to have the feeling that

351
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Just

352
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Los

353
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Nnn's

354
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
Determination I was like no

355
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
I can't

356
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
I don't want this to keep happening at this point

357
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
See

358
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
The pieces that are left

359
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
And I would like them to be hours

360
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
I think the bear has had his fill

361
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
And this has to stop now so

362
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
They go back inside

363
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
And Rob immediately Google's like how to deter bears

364
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
And then at some point they come across a website that says

365
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
The one thing that bears are very afraid of is

366
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Human voices

367
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Yeah so I was like

368
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911

So

403
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
Meaning of

404
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,087
Just curious what you thought about

405
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
Your podcast being used as

406
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Scarecrow

407
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
How do you feel about that Alex

408
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
I think I thought it was great

409
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,071
Like I got the only I thought they were very limited range of

410
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,935
I'd like to Russia to be like the duct tape of pod

411
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
You can do all kinds of

412
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Yeah so far we've only

413
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
Had to listen to it scare bears

414
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,175
But yes it's not like there's a there's one aspect of reply-all that

415
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
I might be particularly effective

416
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
At

417
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Scaring away

418
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
A bear

419
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
I can still laugh laugh

420
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
PJ's laugh

421
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Imagining a bear that was like

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
How big is people

423
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm going to walk a little closer on Mariposa Street and then I was like

424
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
I do like I do mostly feel like I feel like I'm supposed to

425
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
I got mostly feel good that it

426
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
It's like useful

427
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:47,904
Was a terrible irony is here's a city boy who escaped the city Lynch the love the peace and quiet and then

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
I just peace and quiet invaded and turn it back into a city

429
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:57,376
Is it yeah I mean they're there their that take Brooklyn just followed him up there

430
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Convertible

431
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,288
I'm sure though it kind of felt reassuring to have that like going in the background

432
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:09,920
You know that your bear tutoring machine is doing its job it was an instinctual choice

433
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,248
I felt like continually revealed itself to be the right one

434
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
How do you check that first morning

435
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
The pizzas are all safe

436
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,440
Cuz I'm the evening reply-all continuing to play

437
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Next day he goes out and there's

438
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,168
No sign of any bears and she gets like 10 peaches off the tree and then the next day no bears again

439
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,640
T-Pain Alex they're still talking about the internet and there's like 20 peaches off the tree over the days

440
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,200
How many peaches did he capture

441
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
From the bear encounter at the bear

442
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Had eaten about 40 peaches

443
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
Space on the bucket cleaning up the

444
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
The mess

445
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,304
How many peaches the bear had taken from him the way it should

446
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Check out

447
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
I got we got about as many pieces

448
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
He thinks it

449
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
He and Cindy got like 40 pizzas to so like 5 Ian PC than he's thinking I win

450
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
At least I didn't lose

451
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
We tied

452
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
And so anyway

453
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,760
The end of writing this entire story on Twitter

454
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
The story of how was happening in my yard right now

455
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
And

456
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
It got a

457
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Big response and I was a little surprised

458
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
I think that the number of

459
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
People who took the Bears

460
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Height

461
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
But I was like that's the problem I can't the bear have some

462
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
Not up to you just for you like

463
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Bear apologists

464
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
Do they understand that there are there's food sources

465
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
Been the one Peachtree and Rob dubbins yard

466
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,992
Like clearly not know

467
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
The way I see it is like

468
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,696
If Rob had domesticated the Bear Race it to only understand that food gave her metri and then sent it out of the woods there

469
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
But other than that that's ridiculous

470
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
I'm not taking

471
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
The morality of it

472
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
The bear doesn't like

473
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,008

Yeah I guess so

525
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,632
We were just curious like I mean Maurice was tell us a little bit about the first time she saw the bear

526
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,704
Like when when did you did she tell you about that when you do first

527
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah my wife's on the 1st

528
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,544
First time I caught up just a glimpse of him

529
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
But at the time I videotaped

530
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
It was actually the third time I saw

531
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
So

532
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,016
It's the summer of 2014 at night or so

533
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
And

534
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
I was hanging out on my deck

535
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
When

536
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
TVs

537
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Despair

538
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Coming from the woods up towards the street

539
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Black bear

540
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,096
So I ran out I got my cell phone and just started videotaping with an older

541
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864

542
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
Three it's like a shaky video

543
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,032
Brakes are just like painting the phone all over the place to try to find it with the phone

544
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Marisa's outside

545

00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
All the sudden Greg Zooms in

555
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
On this Lake

556
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Blurry

557
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,248
Blob that is moving across his neighbor's driveway

558
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Amy Adams green butt

559
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
What you see is this

560
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Black bear that is a bipedal bear

561
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
Walking on its hind legs

562
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Walking across the

563
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Street

564
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Like a human

565
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Oh my God

566
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
Wait that's the bear that the bear

567
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
The bear is just straight up walking on two feet you could totally be like a kid in a bear suit like it's like actually

568
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
The first time I saw it I was like that is what my dad looks like when he stumbled out

569
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
Of the hallway in the middle of the night without his glasses on

570
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,368
Still motoring motoring and also serve puttering pottering with purpose

571
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
Okay so Grey Goose

572
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
Great great great great guy.

573
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Filming this

574
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah I'm over in the front yard of my house

575
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
Watching this walking bear that's what I see him walk

576
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,800
Up my neighbor's driveway into the street

577
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,104
Then the Bears to the bear at the Crossing

578
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
The street over into another Neighbors

579
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
Front yard front yard right now

580
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
And

581
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,576
Somewhere off camera

582
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
You here

583
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Their neighbor

584
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
You know that's a bear

585
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
You know that the Bear right

586
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Okay

587
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Through your house

588
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Look up

589
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
Go get her

590
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
That the video lasts for about

591
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
3 minutes and then

592
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Stop supporting

593
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
So we got the video we watch it go through the woods

594
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
Stop 5 go inside after giving the kids bath

595
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
I just take it I want to share with some people so I threw it on YouTube

596
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,312
An hour and a half hour later after it upload Zoe go and send out a couple emails to like some friends

597
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
Family just be like hey I thought this weird wild bear walking

599
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Go to bed

600
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
And then the next day

601
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Greg check

602
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
People from viral media companies it's family members somebody put it on Facebook it was spreading on Facebook and

603
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
I was blown away

604
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
But then

605
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
All these other people's videos

606
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Because this bear is being spotted

607
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Bolivar town

608
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,592
Videos are like

609
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Lake of the bear

610
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Coming out at night time early dinner time

611
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
I like walking around the woods

612
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Beatbox better than you.

613
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,624
Strolling down neighborhood streets popping his head into garbage cans

614
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Going through people's backyards

615
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
It was like it was amazing

616
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
He would come like right there

617
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,704
You know right there

618
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
Disappear tree over there

619
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Getting to Paris

620
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Out of the tree

621
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
It was great to see him

622
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
You know because he

623
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
Eventually folks in town give him the name titles

624
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,096
Good Morning America national news

625
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
A black bear

626
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Walks on his

627
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Timeless

628
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Bright like a human kind of like

629
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,432
Oh my gosh like what a fun cute adorable animal doing something that looks like a human that's so fun

630
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Well

631
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Sort of everyone

632
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Which is

633
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
Where we get to Lisa

634
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Tomato

635
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,352
So basically we heard about Lisa she was like a big player in this whole life

636
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Love affair with pedals

637
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
3 Guion died with the Down Under dining room table okay

638
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Like where

639
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
When did you first

640
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Learning the bear

641
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,688
I don't remember the exact date I don't even have a hard time with years

642
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,016
But I think it was in 2014 that

643
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
She was on Facebook I saw a post about this bear and he was

644
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
In a

645
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
Video walking by

646
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,744
And I was like oh my God this is so sad like you want me to think it was like

647
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Funnier

648
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Now I thought it was sad

649
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
Why does the video make her sad

650
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,008
Accuworx animal rescue and she's rather than being like just

651
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
Wow for her when she wants a video

652
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
What she saw was a bear that was

653
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Injured

654
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,272
So the thing is that if you look at some screenshots of petals close up you'll see if she

655
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
Really had no hands

656
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
One was like amputated

657
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,184
Like I stabbed it was like pretty much missing and the other one was

658
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Just broken

659
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Mangled

660
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,816
At least that that's why he walk on his hind legs

661
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,424
I mean I'm sure he ate whatever berries or whatever he could get

662
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,288
Because he couldn't use his paws is why he was walking around these neighborhoods

663
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Because he was starving and he couldn't feed himself

664
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,152
Her first thought was we have to help this bear

665
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
So

666
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
She gets in touch with a couple women they start a GoFundMe campaign helps a pedals raise $25,000 in my

667
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
4 days

668
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
To basically Dart him transport them and house them at this place called The Wildlife orphanage there's a couple other why

669
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,840
Wild bears there a couple of Pam like retired

670
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Circus Bears if you will

671
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
There's a pond a lot of trees and its price

672
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
You know it's not a zoo

673
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
So

674
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
The best thing to do with petition

675
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
The state of New Jersey to Justina Lake

676
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,664
Do it cuz that's against the law for us to just start a bear and

677
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,528
Put them in a truck and take them so they get his petition going it ends up going at like around the world

678
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,368
Gold light 400,000 signatures

679
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
Date for all ready to go everything was in please

680
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Interstate

681
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Has

682
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
We're not doing that

683
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Really why well so I got in touch with the Press people at njdep which is like being

684
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Environmental

685
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,824
Department of New Jersey and basically they said

686
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
We have no interest in commenting on this

687
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,248
White why would they not even comment well I think you can understand that

688
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
If

689
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
You know the rest of the story

690
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
Has a lot more

691
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Story

692
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
That you don't know

693
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
Alright let's hear the rest then

694
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,048
Okay what's up what you basically have if you have a collision of two ideas

695
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
About black bears

696
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
And what they are and what they need

697
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
So that's John welham magazine

698
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
I knew more about it earlier works like before he got famous

699
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,968
He's written a lot about animals including pedals and explain to us that what you had was this device

700
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
Where

701
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
On the one side you have people like Lisa

702
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
When they looked at the bear they thought

703
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
It's injured struggling

704
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
We gotta get out there

705
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
But

706
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
On the other side

707
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Do you have the state of New Jersey

708
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
Came out it from a completely different

709
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
View point where they

710
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
You know we're just as interested in

711
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
Calling code helping the bear and making sure the

712
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
The Berrics

713
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
You know

714
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Livid

715
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
I don't know best life I supposed to say

716
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,320
But they wanted to go by in a very different way as far as they were concerned it wasn't it was a wild animal

717
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
And you don't take a wild animal out of the Wild

718
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
Unless absolutely necessary fact that you saw this bear walking on two legs

719
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
There is a real Survivor

720
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,680
This is like a feet of evolution like this pair of all

721
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
To survive we should just let him do his thing

722
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Davis still out there being a bear

723
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
It's the right thing to do

724
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
So this is

725
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
This is the part of the story

726
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
About pedals that we

727
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
We haven't told you yet

728
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
So

729
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,600
Petals was first found in 2014 first showed up

730
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:15,744
Shut up again the next summer and then yeah even early 2016 their videos of pedals and then nothing

731
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,352
And then a bear that has become a national sensation is

732
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
Is Dad the bear known as pedals

733
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
So in October of 2016

734
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
News broke that pedals

735
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Batman killed

736
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,872
Turn the bear hunt on Monday

737
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
A place in New Jersey

738
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,760
A familiar story played out

739
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
This morning over the apparent killing of a

740
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
The fame blackbear

741
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
There was anger protest

742
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
Kill the bear

743
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,280
Dick piece of s*** death threats against an innocent Hunter

744
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Selfie

745
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Family

746
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
People have actually threatened to burn down his business

747
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,752
People posted photos of his home his wife's name and in the midst of all this

748
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
I think everybody out there should

749
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
State of New Jersey

750
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
People were angry at the state

751
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
State of New Jersey

752
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Did nothing

753
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
About the bear

754
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Where was the bet when people report is it Saturday injured for years

755
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
This is there

756
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Where were they then

757
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
I was so rough

758
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Had my moment you know

759
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
But people sent me bear things

760
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
You know like I have

761
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,992
I have like the little through the bear on top of the radio and

762
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
Sabrina got me a picture that looks just like that all the time

763
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
Beautiful artist that doesn't even know pedals but

764
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
Made this picture of a bear that looks just like I'm in

765
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Just cool

766
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
About you know it's just

767
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
People thought

768
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
YouNow

769
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
They saw how hard

770
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
We fought

771
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
But the book is the best

772
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
It really is

773
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,336
And what's the writer's name John Williams

774
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Yeah I talked to him he was nice

775
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
I remember being like

776
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
You want to what

777
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
So

778
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
John axley Road

779
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Obituary for

780
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,928
Do you have a copy of the school

781
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,280
Is the New York Times Magazine's annual lives they lived

782
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Got it

783
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,912
I just thought you know the way I've always

784
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
I thought I'd like the lies they lived

785
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Bowie picture

786
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,824
You know it's about this many people

787
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,456
Interesting way to talk about the world that we live in

788
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
Janet Reno

789
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Pedals the bear

790
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
One reason why I find conversations by animal so interesting is because

791
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
Animals always have no comment

792
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
Right there

793
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,536
You basically have groups of human being

794
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
Turtles eating around like a little screenshot

795
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
The pedal standing

796
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Trying to figure out what to do with it walking towards the mailbox in the mail

797
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,968
Yeah and this is actually the picture that I used on his

798
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,832
Our version of Lake rest in peace petals memorial page

799
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,024
Yeah me too I felt like God you want me just to read the end of the Piece Special

800
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Okay

801
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,424
Do you know the circumstances what is a hunter knew that bears identity before he or she fired

802
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
Weather panels.

803
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Spend some time on all fours

804
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
Had been distinguishable from an ordinary bear

805
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,872
Whether he's been standing upright in the wilderness looking for posterous

806
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Inconspicuous

807
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Inconspicuously like himself

808
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,992
That is the best posture the reproof

809
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
What is resilience

810
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
Might have marked in for death

811
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
There's never clear what we owed pedals exactly

812
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,928
You could argue that allowing pedals to live in the woods

813
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
Be hunted like any other bear with an act of respect

814
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Validation of his wildness

815
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
You could also argue that it was a gruesome lapse of human compassion

816
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
Pedal stood for something we may never agree what it was

817
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Do you guys

818
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
Even the how did you

819
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,368
There wasn't a clip in there you didn't use a clip from the movie The Other clip the movie

820
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,904
Well a matter of

821
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
Bad we do

822
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,792
Where does this is where you send that thing again

823
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Kim

824
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
We call

825
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Bulshit

826
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
On your stupid rules

827
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Play It Again

828
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Bulshit

829
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
And yet in doing so you follow this

830
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
The beauty of it

831
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Now

832
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
All right we're going to do or you take a little break

833
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:04,000
Are going to clear the air and come back with a couple producers to level up with more respect

834
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Euros

835
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Morning moments

836
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,912
Hi this is Jason studstill calling from Seattle Washington

837
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472

843
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

844
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
And I'm here because I need your

845
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
And I request

846
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,560
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

847
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,400
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

848
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Tiny moments

849
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Brilliance

850
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
Basically I want to hear about this

851
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Times when a kid did something

852
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,104
It just means you lean back and say

853
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Well

854
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Maybe it was the moment that I

855
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

856
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
To you

857
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

858
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,183
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music

859
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,303
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

860
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
We're interested in the

861
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Epic moments where

862
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Kid does something super smart

863
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
It doesn't have anything to do with it

864
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
If you have a story

865
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287

866
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591

Flash brilliance

872
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Thank you so much

873
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Chad Robert Radiolab Breaking Bad News Bears and we got three bears story so far

874
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,055
You know maybe this is the moment when I should admit that

875
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,615
Everybody broke repair

876
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,711
I can see that coming

877
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
You know and you woke up in the morning full of them figuring excitement would you do the hard news or would you right away

878
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
What you do the bad news

879
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,303
Like what I was hoping actually and I mean immediately Molly Simons had a little bit

880
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,887
Like the hurricane you just come in but I was really hoping was it somebody was going to get us

881
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
Solid Rock Solid breaking news about bear

882
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,591
Kind of thing and I actually had one in my sights that I was just sitting on waiting to see if anybody got it so

883
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:32,991
Something that the Trump Administration did though most people to know actually the seeds of it were planted during the Obama Administration wasn't

884
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
The grizzly bears

885
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
Came off endangered list it and in the wake of that there was about to be for the first time in almost 50 years

886
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
A hunt around Yellowstone

887
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:47,071
Because the Grizzlies have gone from like you know whatever it was a hundred left

888
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,375
2 now around 700

889
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
They've also started encroaching on

890
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
Makers campers hunters and Ranchers

891
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,639
These are the ideas that once you do list them which should be a success say they came back we can do list them now but also the same time that means that

892
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
We can start

893
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Column

894
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,783
Mechoulam yasso the ranchers are geared up to get their licenses and head out there and have this hun

895
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,159
And at the last moment there was a court case and a judge said no no not time to do the Hun

896
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,815
And that happened a couple weeks ago and then that just at hunting season he's before the hunt or whatever it was I guess

897
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
What is the reason from the judge

898
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:26,495
I think clearly like some activists if they're not yet ready this will damaged

899
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,359
The population in so yeah the judge had kind of like that maybe that the administration hadn't shown

900
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
Enough recovery to Warren

901
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Hunting

902
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,599
And but that then just two days ago that of that ruling got to have like either confirmed her upheld or whatever it is and now that

903
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
Functionally actually means that the grizzly is not

904
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Dlisted

905
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,279
That it is still on the endangered species list and there's even some amongst

906
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Bear

907
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Turn Folk

908
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
You talk to you then they're not

909
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Quite sure what to think because

910
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
If you're going to have an endangered species list you need to occasionally have

911
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
An animal come off of it

912
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,103
Hey need to win to win otherwise you just lose the political will to even

913
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,407
Yeah totally do it or you or you just

914
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Show the doing it is pointless

915
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:12,063
You're going to lose them eventually sold on you never get off right now you need someone to get off and I guess

916
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,879
You know you can probably go back and forth for a lot about whether it's

917
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Time for the

918
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,719
Yellowstone Grizzlies to be off or not but

919
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Yeah so nobody got

920
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,815
That but but don't we have one more

921
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
On story and it comes from

922
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
Annie McEwen and lots of knots

923
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Verses about bears

924
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
Some ways both really is another

925
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
Using the sense that it's recent but it's breaking news in that we're staying stuff

926
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,503
That is true about the world that has not been reported before

927
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
So it's

928
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
Breaking news about bears

929
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,695
Yeah I think so okay where do you start

930
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
Restart in the far north

931
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,607
In the Arctic Islands in Canada

932
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
Wintrust place you can imagine

933
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,567
With an Inuit Hunter named David katana

934
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
April 13th

935
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Denying

936
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
I live in a small community

937
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
407

938
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
People and everybody knows

939
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
Pretty pretty lady

940
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
Anyway he told us the story of a hunt that he was on that was unlike any hunted ever been on before

941
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
Where he caught a bear

942
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,303
That was unlike any Berry you never seen before

943
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,143
What happened April 2010

944
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,471
Me and my wife were going hunting badgers nice morning

945
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Shoffner

946
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
Top mesh weather in his wife said it understood used in Scooby-Doo

947
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,991
They're called up a I just don't like the snow machines that use mechanical device

948
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,063
They happen this canoes they headed across

949
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
The sea ice

950
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
And then they're heading towards

951
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,207
Cuz Island that are playing in camping in this empty cabin

952
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,743
You got to that cabin

953
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,839
Open account at the cabin with damaged Persian bears

954
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Why they do that immediately

955
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,703
Anime side let's go back to another cabin

956
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
True love anniversary

957
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
Start heading back

958
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
Look for in the app

959
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,151
Afternoon following the court in court to a cabin

960
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
There was a hill

961
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
And I could see some traffic coming down

962
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
Down to the cabin

963
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
Fresh Bear Tracks around this

964
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,695
They're coming back

965
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
And that's the approach if they see that this

966
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Cabin is also been Rancid

967
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,351
The bear has gone in

968
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
He broke the window

969
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,959
Okay well we'll continue on

970
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,031
So this is a third cabin they pass wow

971
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
The door open

972
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
Made a message say is it normal for a polar bear to go into cabins and throw mattresses at

973
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
Portable Thornridge Drive

974
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,111
Start tracking it again huacachina cop Holloway

975
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,927
And at this point they start getting a little worried

976
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,999
Because these tracks coming toward the community

977
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
Georgette Colfax

978
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
1/4 cabin ransacked and 1/5

979
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:10,239
Jesus been through and right next to the sisters A6 cabin

980
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,567
I noticed you're not open

981
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,407
Too close to the cabin this is this presumably the next

982
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:22,015
Destination for the bear

983
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Sure enough

984
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
Is bear was Heidi

985
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Grandma cabin

986
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,207
Constricted body

987
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Start running

988
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Shaw

989
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Esthetician

990
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,239
Stop my steering for my rifle on a sled

991
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
Back of my heritage

992
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,383
Stranger standing up

993
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,991
I know

994
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
But this bear

995
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Feeling better

996
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
Is differin

997
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Something is off

998
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,135
I took a shot at

999
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
I hit it

1000
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
He kills the bear

1001
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Mdlottery

1002
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
They approached it on their schedules they get off

1003
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Despair

1004
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Looks

1005
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Strange

1006
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
It's a blonde bear

1007
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,199
Once you catch a grizzly bear before and that was my first time

1008
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
Amber Lakes are dark. Boots and socks or whatever

1009
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Circles around

1010
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:37,791
Wow interesting so he takes it back to town and he checked in with this government officer

1011
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
Can I take a look at it and he's like David

1012
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
I think this might not be a polar bear

1013
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Might not be a great leap

1014
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
It might be a hybrid

1015
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,775
Hybrid bear

1016
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,847
Yeah like a little bit of both little bit of both

1017
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:55,967
And David had never even heard of that before I have never actually heard of that it's not a common thing to happen

1018
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
But a few years before David the bear

1019
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,551
Extremely rare

1020
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:05,695
Creature shot and killed in the Canadian Arctic first one ever was caught in the wild

1021
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,023
Grizzly polar bear hybrid media

1022
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,351
David Attenborough included

1023
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Bound passenger

1024
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
Got really excited

1025
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
So we've known for a while that it's happening out there and even David has encountered a few more

1026
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,151
Out there in the wild

1027
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
Two little teddy bear cubs

1028
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
For sale hybrid

1029
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,551
So cute this is some kind of crossbreeding between these two species

1030
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
But

1031
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,719
The crazy twist was when when this guy David Katana shot this thing at

1032
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,815
This particular pizzly Berry sent it off for genetic testing

1033
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
It's called the first

1034
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,887
Second generation bear

1035
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
The mother was

1036
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
Polar bear half grizzly

1037
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
And a father with a for Boost

1038
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
This Bear That David shot

1039
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
Is the first indication that

1040
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,687
These bears are fertile

1041
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,527
Which is something that you wouldn't think if a horse and a donkey

1042
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,295
Say what

1043
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
Together making me all those mules can't then have Offspring I thought that two different speakers

1044
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
Different species

1045
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,583
The branch off evolutionarily like hundreds of thousand

1046
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,703
Pretty much the same time that we broke off from the Neanderthals and so be like us

1047
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Meeting a neanderthal

1048
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
Odin the you know the

1049
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:29,407
Crown Heights bar something and going home person and creating

1050
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:35,039
Creating a specific it sounds like you had

1051
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:41,439
Franklin Ave April 10th call me

1052
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
Wait wait

1053
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
Do they branch

1054
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Instead of the police and The great leap branches

1055
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
At the same time is left in the neanderthal

1056
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
Are around of a ballpark I mean all these are ranges so okay

1057
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
I thought that's not

1058
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
That doesn't work

1059
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
What it kind of

1060
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,407
Shouldn't work

1061
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,479
But Wildlife manager Marshall Brannigan says

1062
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,551
Sorted does I'm kind of against the bylaws

1063
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,087
Terminology that we use for

1064
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
Breaking the rules

1065
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
But neither

1066
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,511
Grizzly bear

1067
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Has been growing over the last few years

1068
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Mission in action

1069
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,191
Grolar bear might not be considered a rare creature

1070
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
For too long of general idea about this whole new species

1071
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
Is it linked to the changing climate

1072
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,687
Because now these two species are overlapping

1073
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Canada's grizzly bears North Wild

1074
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
Polar Bears are losing much of their eyes

1075
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Spennymoor

1076
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Thailand

1077
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
Polar bears

1078
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Have

1079
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,927
Hair covering the bottom of their feet

1080
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,487
Grizzly bears do not but it pads

1081
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,559
Fit knee pads

1082
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Has like partial hair

1083
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Recovering

1084
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
Feel like maybe you get the best of both worlds you know grip or whatever but also your your warm

1085
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,127
So it's a good thing to be one of these half hybrid Vigor Best of Both Worlds

1086
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,175
This is the new bear in town

1087
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Yeah

1088
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
The may become increasingly common

1089
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,399
That's kind of like a necessary we got interested in and that's the story

1090
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
That has been reported

1091
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,007
But then last year this paper came out and it

1092
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
Kind of completely changes the story

1093
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:38,687
And are we at the place where the where the the bears become breaking news

1094
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,551
This is even more interesting than that first

1095
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
It's way way weirder

1096
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,207
It could more dramatically play out like on an HBO miniseries

1097
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Lay it on me

1098
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:57,375
So last year a paper came out and it's signed if we talk to you Marcia Branigan is one of his co-authors

1099
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
It is a basically made a big giant list of every

1100
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Sighting of a hybrid bear

1101
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:07,103
And of all the genetic analysis to like every time we've seen this happen in The Wire

1102
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,175
And all the information we could possibly glean from that

1103
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,551
And what you found was it every single one of these hybrids can be traced back

1104
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,599
21 female

1105
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
Polar bear

1106
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,927
One single bear

1107
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
Really

1108
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Names

1109
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
Bear 1096

1110
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
0

1111
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
Is she is she is literally the mother of all hybrid

1112
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,895
Wow so there's something about this polar bear that seem to attract Grizzly gentleman

1113
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,223
Or she was just interested in Grizzly gentleman

1114
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,551
We mostly just have kind of guesses of how it went

1115
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,135
Down since there were no Witnesses this is Elisa McCall she's

1116
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,927
Staff scientist at polar bears internet

1117
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
But we think

1118
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Could have happened

1119
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:01,375
Is that there was a female polar bear and maybe she did have some you know interesting personal preference for brown bears or May

1120
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Maybe it was simply that

1121
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
She was an estrus

1122
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,495
And a Milky Way There

1123
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:11,615
So she's giving off a scent that she wants to mate okay they leave the stinky butt

1124
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,687
Trails and so males will follow them on the ice what are those smell like

1125
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:21,087
Oh my gosh do you know I've never smelled that but I know to a male polar bear they smell good that's all I know

1126
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
But as the female put downs

1127
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,183
McNally Footprints the males are like

1128
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:30,815
Oh yeah and they'll follow her for you know days and it's cute though actually put their feet right in

1129
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,167
Footprints yeah so maybe there was just

1130
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,263
This really aggressive brown bear grizzly bear mail

1131
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
2

1132
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Follow the female track

1133
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,383
XM could have fought off other

1134
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,455
Polar bear male maybe this is a case of of like

1135
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,855
Consensual but if you look at sort of like the genetic analysis it looks like animated with tutu

1136
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,159
Grizzly bear she had babies with

1137
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,951
Two different grizzly bears

1138
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
And with one of them she had babies

1139
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,839
Years apart oh so she's had three letters with with

1140
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
This was two different grizzly bear

1141
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Interesting

1142
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Singer from the

1143
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,471
3 non hybrid bear

1144
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,519
So this is narrowing

1145
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,615
Scope really quickly

1146
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:19,711
Yeah just like species why'd you know new adaptation

1147
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
It's just like

1148
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,295
There's this one lady who has this one king

1149
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,695
Strange Place Savannah

1150
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:36,095
Those were just the only dudes around I was thinking like oh my God maybe this bear is a genius

1151
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:42,495
Things like ice change around her and you think I need to save my DNA and the best way to do is to put it

1152
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
With a grizzly

1153
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,591
Is there doing better than I am that's hilarious I mean

1154
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
Yeah I imagine that

1155
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,943
Bears

1156
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
Unfortunately

1157
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:58,879
The hybrids are kind of a mess to be honest they were really well suited for land or for ice they were such an in-between bear

1158
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,951
That they really just weren't that

1159
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
Grizzly bears are so well adapted

1160
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:10,143
To life on land and finding food got the big hump they've got the big whitehead they've got these long

1161
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:15,263
Claws for digging they don't have fur on the pads of their feets they don't need it polar bears are

1162
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,823
So well adapted for the ice they've got a much

1163
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,223
Smoother Sneakerhead that helps him get in and out of seal hole they've got thicker sharper claws to grab seals and help them walk

1164
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
Their fur is

1165
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:31,391
Halo eye which helps trap warm air against their body is in the hybrid

1166
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,207
They're like this weird in-between so their head is kind of like

1167
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,583
Not really sleep but not really boxy kind of this weird in between They Don't Really blend in that while with the ice

1168
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
Soar with the land cuz they're kind of this creamy color

1169
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:46,495
And then there for itself is depending on where the Furs on the body

1170
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Is like a mix of

1171
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
Halo but not Halo like

1172
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,127
So yeah it backfired on

1173
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Nerf that was her

1174
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
Is Marathon hot

1175
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,271
But I like that idea don't these pizzly bears are just

1176
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Probably not

1177
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
The new

1178
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
Horizon of the bear that will

1179
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Accident

1180
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Top of that

1181
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:10,559
So okay so it if you're Imagining the family tree right so there's a mama polar bear

1182
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:15,679
With these two grizzly bears at different times write a letter to Dad in the stepdad

1183
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
One of the kids

1184
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
A daughter

1185
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
And she's the only one who's had kids

1186
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
And came from her

1187
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,175
But it turns out that all those third-generation Bears including the

1188
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Bear the David

1189
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
Katana shot

1190
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
That bear the

1191
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,087
The daughter bear she mated with her father

1192
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Wait

1193
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,391
There's some sort of incest

1194
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
Parts of the eye

1195
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,815
Let's so weird

1196
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
Kind of like dated the stepdad sort of thing

1197
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
Yes or no

1198
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,215
Yeah she slept with the same two dudes with her mom.

1199
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Oh my God

1200
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
Gosh now we're going from HBO to like

1201
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Shakespeare

1202
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
Yeah I like Greek

1203
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:02,527
Tragedy years now all the sudden it looks less like a species wide

1204
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
Movement for life will find a way

1205
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,879
And it looks a little more like this is one crazy intro

1206
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Wow

1207
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,719
So what do you make of that

1208
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,047
Maybe this one like crazy inbred family is the

1209
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
First

1210
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
You know quite awkward attempt

1211
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,911
What may become like

1212
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:25,567
Might be like Evolution driving forward making shaky step up their shaky status

1213
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,663
It's not like pretty the way you expected it to Ranchi because sex

1214
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Like like

1215
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Animals try things

1216
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
Flights

1217
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,855
This could maybe this is going to keep going but but

1218
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Only time will tell

1219
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
There's no way for us to know

1220
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
And one last thing which is

1221
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
Kind of an ass

1222
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,263
Afterthoughts but but maybe not

1223
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
Because while it's not

1224
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:02,431
Clearweather are polar bear family is is an awkward evolutionary step forward

1225
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Or just

1226
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
Freaky

1227
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
At what we do know

1228
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
Is that nature is not

1229
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
Zachary scheidt

1230
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
When it comes to being sexually

1231
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Creative

1232
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
7th Ave yes

1233
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:21,631
So it turns out at the Museum of Sex they have this exhibit called The Sex lives of animals and my brother was coming in

1234
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
Newtown Barn shy with the horns

1235
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:29,823
And we thought incest is on theme I will send both of us I'm glad you got there cuz my mind went there and I was like

1236
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:36,223
Well organized this before a thing but just so you know but then

1237
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,527
Just made it all that more uncomfortable

1238
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:44,671
But anyway you also didn't know about any of this

1239
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
Cheap

1240
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,743
A really

1241
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:53,119
But we we got guns that room and Anna very nice woman and Steffy Spicer sodas around and

1242
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
We learn just like

1243
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,679
Nature is

1244
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Trying

1245
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471

Butt stuff

1252
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,679
Clitoris is another thing I'm starting to feel like I've been in here a while.

1253
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
Being a little

1254
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,727

Space free passes to the boobie bouncy castle Italy Jimmy got to do it

1258
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
We didn't usually

1259
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,927
Add pictures to my parent

1260
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,223
