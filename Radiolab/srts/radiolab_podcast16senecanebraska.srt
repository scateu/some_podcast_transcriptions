1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Hugo hi I'm Roberto which this is Radiolab it today with me is Simon Adler that to me

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
He's a reporter and producer here and he's got us a tail I do it's an American Tail and a kind of Timely

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,352
I think about you describe it. I think it's one of those classic Us Versus Them tails

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Go back to maybe tonight

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:43,264
Versus Ice storage unit because I in fact it takes place

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
Right in America's Heartland

10
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
Where in the Heartland Nebraska

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Seneca Nebraska

12
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
This tiny little town in Central West

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Nebraska

14
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Okay

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,880
It's near the town of Mullen Nebraska what you got

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
You know obviously also don't know this is Matthew Hanson

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
He is a reporter with the with the Omaha World-Herald and a couple months back you got in touch with us because

18
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
The story about this town right so

19
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I I got an email from a woman who lives a couple miles outside of town she's really upset cuz back in 2014

20
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
The town was

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Split in half

22
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,064
And in fact there was a group of people in the town who were circulating a petition

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
Petition

24
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
That would end the town

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,000
We circulate a petition to end the town do you want to be in town anymore

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
Right by law if you have

27
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Enough signatures on a petition

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,008
You can get things on the ballot and the question that ended up on the ballot was should Seneca

29
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
Cease to exist

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,968
And it's split that a group of people to try to end their own town

31
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
It got us thinking about

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
Let's put that seem to be the selection right now and it occurred to us that maybe just maybe this tiny little town in

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,488
In the middle of Nebraska might have something to say about the rest of us

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
Let's back up there

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
When when did

36
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
All is well in Seneca until what

37
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:20,032
It started with the horses

38
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,360
Actually let me sit back there a lot of horses in Seneca

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Most people in Seneca ride horses

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Imini on them

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
But there were these six particular horses

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Right in the middle of town

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
And

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
You know that the split

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Sort of started

46
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
Right there so I got so curious about what went down in Seneca

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
That I flew to Denver one two three four five five and a half hours into the Sandhills of West

48
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Central Nebraska. Let's see if we can get anything on the radio here rolling sand dune

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Carpeting grass at the ranch catalog is another Ranch what's this Wednesday and smack dab in the middle of the Sandhills

50
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Is Seneca after many hours and many miles we

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
We are here okay

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
So why

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
Cathy's Rolling Hills that are green. With these yellow flowers

54
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,192
Junction 86a Seneca okay with that kind of an old big red sign that says welcome

55
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Seneca with a big

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Okay and get there it looks like

57
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
Starting to drive through town a picture postcard

58
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,968
Small town from yesteryear found by railroad tracks

59
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Direct got the railroad I'm taking a

60
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
I mean really pretty to my right

61
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
An abandoned house

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
To my left

63
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Another boarded-up house

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,072
Another street with absolutely nothing on it no gas station all boarded up another rundown house

65
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
It says no trespassing

66
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
And just really tiny I think one into the other is

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
One eighth of a mile

68
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
And we're done

69
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
So there you go

70
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
At 30 miles per hour it takes

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
10 seconds

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Okay turning around in

73
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Wow okay

74
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
The house to the left here has a giant

75
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
Bored over one of the windows and spray-painted on it is

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Sandy H is a big fat liar

77
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Interesting

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
And so on

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
I ended up just walking through this Tiny Town of Seneca you're like knocking on every door guide I think I may have knocked on every single door

80
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
And of course I ended up talking to some folks wanted in the town others wanted to save it and and

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Sprouts

82
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
She told her notes to me were

83
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Come down hill

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
First house

85
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Is nice

86
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
That's not me

87
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Burnt up yard

88
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
I don't know if this is it

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
How are you this morning

90
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863

00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,007
City and how do you do it very good to meet you everyone told me I can't let you into my house

92
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
I don't have any other way.

93
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
And you want to plug in

94
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
No I'm good I am all set here all

95
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
Good tell me who else you're going to talk to

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Larry Isen

97
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Okay well

98
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Jacquees

99
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Okay

100
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
I'm the sanest

101
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
The person you're going to talk to today

102
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
You know that's what

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
The terrible thing to say

104
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm sorry about the cigarettes

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,383
I want to get into more contemporary things are real quicker to set the stage

106
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
When did Seneca pop up on the map

107
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Well

108
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,807
All I know is when I was a little kid it was a booming town

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,647
But I mean that great dances and wonderful bands

110
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Send beer

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
And there was no place else

112
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
To go I mean Seneca used to be

113
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Really

114
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Really

115
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Find

116
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
But okay

117
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Celebrity tell you the story

118
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
Some people had come and they bought a house in Seneca

119
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Okay this would have been fine except the MLB this animal

120
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
Nobody knows these people

121
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,295
And there is a big fuss about them and their abuse of these animals

122
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
So sure these animals are being abused

123
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,975
I was under the impression that this was all about horses in her front yard is that true they had horses

124
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
They have six horses in their backyard

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
That's the yard

126
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
6 horses in the size of one car garage

127
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Exactly

128
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,103
Get you what you remember the first time you saw the horses Here song

129
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,711
Yeah both at the same time Larry Isen

130
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Former member of the Town board

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,599
I mean it's pretty hard to miss when you drink it down the street when there's

132
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Six blocks to the town

133
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
You know that's it's easy to hear about face

134
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
You'll be on the list also tomorrow I really am I going to be in the probably all have

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,239
I'll have five phone calls by the time I get there

136
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,103
How did you decide that you were going to take this up as a cause as a member of the

137
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
Because of the complaints that were called to my house

138
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
What are you going to do about the horses

139
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,831
Is there they're up to their knees and excrement what are you going to do about

140
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
And so you pass an ordinance or yeah

141
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
And what what did the ordinance say

142
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,815
I don't remember it was two pages but but in any case it

143
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Stipulated

144
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
Certain amount of square footage

145
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Cohorst

146
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
As well as shelter

147
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Well

148
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
That was

149
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Part of it

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
The thing about Seneca has

151
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
There's always a war in Seneca

152
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Again

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Judith Brown

154
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Okay

155
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,487
6 horses in the front yard where the most concrete thing

156
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
But

157
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Larry Isom

158
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
And the bachelor going to go see

159
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
They have always wanted us to look more like

160
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Cute little

161
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Colorado tourist town

162
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Where we talking like beautification like

163
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Yes he wanted to create rules

164
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
To create growth

165
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
And I think they wanted to

166
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
To keep us lower class people in line

167
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
And so

168
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
They were out here

169
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Telling us what to do

170
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,719
And they'll tell you things about me to the 60s

171
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
In New York you did lived in a calm you

172
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Herb thyme and Brenda brain down

173
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
The satanic at 3

174
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
Lake Isom again

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Nancy Ahmed wife

176
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
And here Jackie severe

177
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,359
So we don't want to defend we don't want to bicker though we don't want to open that up

178
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
The ordinances were were necessary because of the situation that we were presented with

179
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
There was no elitism

180
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
They weren't on that board to dictate to anybody on this town

181
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
They need to cover nuts for the horses.

182
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Where you started and then

183
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
You had people that was trying to

184
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Say you're not going to tell me

185
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,703
And if you look around a little town you'll see the ones that take pride in what they have

186
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
I'm sorry

187
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
So

188
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
The town was split into

189
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
I mean we could have liked each other

190
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,575
But we've had nothing but constant

191
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Constance

192
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Fighting

193
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,255
Hello okay she won't hurt you

194
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,607
Millie also wanted to save the town after last name not be used

195
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
This is excited

196
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,983
I mean I've heard so much about you and

197
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
I have to ask where did you hear about

198
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Me from who avoid this is small town

199
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
I mean it just

200
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
All over

201
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,735
The telephones Are Ringing with my name

202
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,623
Okay I got to be nice right you're recording all this recording you don't have to be nice that you can

203
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
I'll be honest I have no use for those people

204
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
I didn't want them to take our time

205
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
How long have you lived inside

206
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Oh

207
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
Guys about 30

208
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
37 years

209
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
And how many people live here

210
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Right in town maybe

211
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
I don't know if even 22

212
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
End

213
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
We get talked about alot

214
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
I made Wichita

215
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Put down a lot

216
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Give me just a minute

217
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Hi honey I

218
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Do you have anything you want me to ask

219
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Okay

220
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
I've been playing phone tag all day long they did people making fun of Seneca

221
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
They make fun of Seneca

222
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Quite a bit

223
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
The outside

224
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
You know I'm like

225
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Oh Seneca doesn't have anything what are you still doing here

226
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
And

227
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
It's not like it used to be

228
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,879
I mean years and years ago this just be at the neatest little town yet everyone live in

229
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
And then it just I don't know it just went

230
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Downhill

231
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
I mean that

232
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
That's the only way you can say it

233
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Cindy Hansen

234
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Wanted save the town

235
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
Unofficial Town distorted

236
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Started smacking

237
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
73 I believe it was

238
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
Stop being a division point

239
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
So the trains no longer stopped here

240
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
So that did away with the three hotels the 24-hour cafe

241
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
The man that had Filling Station pulled out in front of a semi at Mullen that ended that business

242
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
His brother had the shoe shop

243
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,143
And he died of a heart attack sitting there working on his shoes

244
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
The lady that had the variety store

245
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Tripped on a kitten and broke her hip that close that and

246
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
Remind me to print

247
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Anyhow

248
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Seneca really start dying

249
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Presley

250
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Get away from there

251
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,863
What's so I guess I'm here because I'm trying to talk to as many people as I can

252
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
I understand what happened with the whole voting corporate

253
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Again

254
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
Sabre Milly it started out that there was

255
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
6 horses

256
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
They were up in mud up to their probably belly

257
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
And I think

258
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
One of them had to be put down because it was

259
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Kicked this is how close they were

260
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Together anyway I mean I'm an animal lover

261
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
I wanted something done about it

262
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
7-Eleven

263
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Instead so

264
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
We had a meeting

265
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
The board tried to tell him that's not sanitary we did this

266
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
Scusset you know we going to get the horses gone that's the purpose of the the ordinate but it was not just

267
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Judith Brown and they wanted to get rid of all the horses all the cattle all the chickens that is

268
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Ridiculous

269
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Chappie chicken

270
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
But do you want your chickens do they run around town people are so afraid that their animals were going to be taken away

271
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
And then

272
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Eventually

273
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
The board members forbid people to have animals

274
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
That was the gist of it

275
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,191
And so more and more and more the count.

276
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
There's a group of people here in a group of people here nobody gets along nobody on the

277
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,223
Town board with speak to anybody at which course then that just mad I just yell at him louder

278
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Certain people that I just give hand gesture

279
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
I said things like my dog doesn't want to be friends with your dog it was awful

280
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Terry bison

281
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,935
Can I have appointment to your time to talk and the town

282
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Got ugly they started taking pictures of people's places and put it on Facebook and say how they

283
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,967
I didn't clean up their property and just public shaming people this was the same Seneca people that were posting

284
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
Supposedly you know there were aggressive comments that we did have the sheriff come up did anyone tell you

285
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,023
Are you that it was just out of control I mean Xanax you know I took a lot of

286
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
It was a very unhappy

287
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:33,215
Time and so finally people started going around with a petition

288
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
To get the onion corporation on the ballot we thought we will just unincorporate

289
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,479
Corporate unincorporate unincorporated our village

290
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
There are agitators in every group

291
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
Okay that's me that seems kind of like the nuclear option here right like we're just going to blow the whole thing up

292
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Oh yes absolutely

293
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
I think that

294
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Sense of shared community

295
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
Was just slowly dissolving

296
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Year-by-year

297
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Again Matthew Henson of the Omaha World-Herald

298
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,831
And it didn't have it had probably to do with what was happening Seneca but I also believe that I had to do was happen in the United States

299
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Sort of the idea that

300
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
Winning the argument

301
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
It is more important

302
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Then

303
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
The much harder job

304
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,631
Of coming together and say okay we disagree on this

305
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Let's find

306
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
A

307
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
A solution to our

308
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
I'm having a little trouble finding out what about the hot like how close is this

309
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,111
The sense in the town was certainly that this thing was just a dead heat really split right down the middle

310
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Backflips

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
It's all right

312
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
When you come back from break

313
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
Seneca goes to the voting booth

314
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Andesite

315
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679

About Sloan at www. Sloan. Org

318
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

319
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
And I'm here because I need your help

320
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
And I request

321
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

322
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid

323
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
So did something

324
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

326
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Do you

327
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

328
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,791
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

329
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

330
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
Have anything to do with the test if you have a story

331
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287

00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359

Thank you so much

336
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Hello hello

337
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
My name is Simon

338
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
I think I sent you a letter of a week

339
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Even even for 5 minutes

340
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,943
I don't want to you'll probably talk to the haters but I'm done

341
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,527
Let the line dog's leg okay thank you so much all right

342
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Bye goodbye

343
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
That was that was Jacqueline licking

344
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,023
Who is the woman who circulated the petition

345
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
And she I just refuse to

346
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:19,007
I'm rubber collection I'm signing this is Radiolab and Simon other is with me just before the break you were saying

347
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
I'm in the town

348
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
God awful trouble trouble

349
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,943
Happy town was so upset with the town in the government and the people of the town

350
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
That they were circulating a petition

351
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
That would end the town itself

352
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
I mean I got where they were upset

353
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,743
But I certainly don't get the idea that the solution is 2

354
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,631
In this place that is existed since 1888 this again is not to Hansen reporter for the Omaha World-Herald

355
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
And it bugged me

356
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,495
And why why did that bother you because I'm from a small town

357
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
I could imagine it

358
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Happening to my town

359
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,175
A&i I can also empathize with a frustration

360
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
Of the people who wanted to keep it a town I mean you have to meet

361
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
Sandy Hanson

362
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
Will you show me a cup of your favorite artifacts you got here

363
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,999
Who operates a museum of Seneca history

364
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,607
Display says you cannot go to her Museum and not say wait a second

365
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
This place has the value

366
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,007
This one I wish could talk what we got baseball jerseys here with the

367
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
The Seneca baseball team

368
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
I got the uniform

369
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
Even the song one pair of pants don't have the caps

370
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Backcountry

371
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,903
This is the newspaper cutouts 1860 these are pictures of family

372
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,255
Lived here advertisements of people of the area

373
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Seneca Centennial hat

374
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:52,959
And people just send you some part of the concern here that history will be

375
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Forgotten

376
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
It is

377
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Because

378
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,919
Been a town 420 cm

379
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
So

380
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
What is it what does it mean to be a town

381
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,855
What does it mean it means Neighbors coming together

382
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
For the good of each other

383
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
When my husband died

384
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
He died in Texas

385
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Eyebrows by Asia packet

386
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Find I'm just

387
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
Having a graveside service out there at Cemetery

388
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Well the time people wouldn't hear that

389
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
They had a big meal prepared my yard was mowed

390
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
The water was turned on everything was ready to go

391
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
And

392
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
It became a fool

393
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Service

394
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
What is Edgefield

395
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Felt like home

396
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
Like the way you're supposed to feel you know

397
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Warm and wanted

398
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
You see they're talking about something that used to be

399
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
Again to the brown who wanted to end the town

400
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
They wanted to preserve it the way it was

401
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,823
And I agree that used to be a lot of fun

402
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
But that's true of any Town up and down this Railroad

403
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
If they're trying to

404
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Preserve it then what are you trying to do

405
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
You're just accepting that we're going downhill here

406
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
No I'm accepting that

407
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
I myself

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
Do any better than this for myself as an aging woman

409
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
I've only lived here twenty years

410
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
But I'm from here

411
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,776
My mom my dad my cousins are all

412
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Strong all over

413
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Eclc

414
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
And this grass

415
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
You know

416
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Anyway

417
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
I guess what I'm saying this to me it's

418
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Heaven

419
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Like I don't care

420
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
About my house

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Falling down

422
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm 70 years old and I'm going to finish up my Arts

423
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
Supplies and died at the respectable age of 96

424
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
And I do have enough art supplies

425
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
Didn't put enough for years

426
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Could do that

427
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Was that the nerve that was being touched your bad because you want to live this way yes

428
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
These people saying we can be proud of our town we can

429
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
Make it hustle and bustle

430
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
So they're saying nothing you're saying

431
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
No we can be proud of

432
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Just the way it is now

433
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Yeah

434
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,440
Say

435
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Okay so how

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
When did you first hear about

437
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
The petition going around

438
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Car wash

439
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,680
Again Millie from the safe Seneca side

440
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,544
I think the same day it was going around I heard about it

441
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
And how how did you feel in that mode

442
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,176
It was horrible it really was it was just

443
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
It was more than frustrating it was

444
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Just like somebody punches you in the gut

445
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,904
She lets all the air you know it's just

446
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
It's the sad

447
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,328
Mostly it just seemed like if we could get rid of this unbelievable piece

448
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Bureaucracy

449
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
We could just live here

450
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,520
So finally the incorporation it got on the ballot

451
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,616
At the regular election where you do the Senators and all that

452
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
We had a special ballot for Seneca where we voted for the town and would it or would it not be a name

453
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Incorporate

454
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
What did you feel when

455
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,208
I don't remember feeling anything except I've got to get in there and vote

456
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
Dim if you don't mind just telling me how you about it

457
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh I voted to the unincorporated

458
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
I voted to keep the Town Incorporated incorporate I voted to keep the town

459
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
And then she said okay that's the last Seneca Valley

460
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
Shoe designer shoes

461
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
Kevin Jackie severe

462
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016
Sabre

463
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
Because I don't think I've ever had anybody explain this to me yet

464
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,440
Can you explain the night of the election and what what actually happened

465
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,792
Well you know we have internet access so we were watching the election results

466
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
On the internet to see how it came out

467
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
Who is we are there were I don't remember the four or five of us six of us maybe I'm not sure who all was there

468
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
What's the weather would you like refreshing the page over and over again how did that

469
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
No we knew about what time they'll be on you know we gave him an hour or so and we logged on and

470
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Song

471
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
We saw that

472
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
The Village was unincorporated

473
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
It was by one vote

474
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:34,816
It was 15 to 16 we lost our town

475
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Sandy Hanson again

476
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
What was that

477
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
I can't stay at Public Radio

478
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
What was lost the day after they decided to abolish the town

479
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,968
Sheriff come down with him I don't know what they thought we were going to

480
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
Shoot him off with guns or what

481
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,160
But the sheriff came down they took the greater they took the tractor took our snow plow

482
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
And

483
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,768
We no longer have our Street Maintenance our lights

484
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Maybe your identity

485
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
I don't know

486
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
We never had much here but we didn't ask for much

487
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
I mean

488
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
We lost

489
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
We lost

490
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
Sunny kobe taken off the map

491
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
And if it isn't on the map where they can look it up

492
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
Mayberry nor nobody even knows it's there

493
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
Why I cried but I mean it hurt

494
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
Janet Jackson again

495
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,440
People are moving away from ready to go

496
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
We're all ready to leave

497
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
We don't have anybody there's been nobody move here since

498
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Nobody

499
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
It sounds like you're saying the future is gone

500
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,032
I wouldn't say it's gone but I would say it's very very limited in unlikely

501
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
Yes I am famotidine incorporate

502
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Again Terry Hartman

503
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
I love this town

504
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,576
And I think the people who voted to unincorporated

505
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Are the people who wanted to keep things the way they were

506
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
We didn't want to change

507
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
I know everything has to

508
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
To change but

509
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
But I didn't know what else

510
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
To stop the fighting

511
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
You know this is my hometown to

512
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
I don't know how to explain it is

513
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
It just got so ugly and out of hand and

514
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Some of the members of the village board for just crazy

515
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
But the town board

516
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
Was just three members

517
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Millie

518
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
They have to do

519
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Really what

520
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
The majority of the time once

521
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
To do

522
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Otherwise we can get rid of them

523
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Do you believe in the Democracy of Senate

524
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
I believe in democracy

525
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
Does that make me thin idiot

526
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
I mean I live in Hope

527
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
You know

528
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
It just it really

529
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Felt like

530
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,784
Seneca had lost something essential

531
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,880
When were talking about basic American democracy

532
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,440
Again Matthew Hanson of the Omaha World-Herald

533
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,024
And it worried me to see that in part because I could feel that

534
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
And still feel bad happening

535
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
On a national level

536
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Dick the kind of

537
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Just completely black

538
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Conversation

539
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Around

540
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Shared

541
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Values or

542
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Compromise

543
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
I've got a smoke more

544
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Drink more

545
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
And one last time

546
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Okay

547
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Judith Brown

548
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
So

549
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
Can I tell you what I want to hear

550
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
Maybe the strongest argument for

551
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Keeping Seneca

552
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
But town on the books

553
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
Is that then there was some sort of framework

554
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
To force those two

555
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
Communities within the town

556
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
To be together and to think together

557
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
And with that now gone

558
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,736
There is now no communication no compromise

559
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,624
None of those people had anything to do with us before accepted

560
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Continually criticized

561
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
We were

562
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
So

563
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
We couldn't compromise with

564
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
These people they were not rational

565
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
All rationality was gone by then

566
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,264
And what's going to happen with this next election

567
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
What America is full of diverse opinions and it has managed to work and I guess if we take what happened

568
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Here

569
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
And if we apply that model to the rest of the United States

570
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Like it's not a town then what

571
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
We have the county we have the state

572
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
And the little town without those hateful people in it

573
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Is really quite lovely

574
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
But it's not a townhouse

575
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
I don't know why you think that

576
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Officially right

577
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
But it is a tell

578
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Here we are

579
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
I'm going to leave here until I die and so is Rose

Inherent Elsa woman lands in

581
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
So you would say that even though on the book Seneca no longer

582
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Exist

583
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
Seneca still exist

584
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
And we're still two tribes

585
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
2 tribes of turkeys that's how I usually put it

586
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
It'll never get along

587
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,224
