1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,496
Northern listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736
List of starting

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,040
Can you ready

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,136
Sheri Fink who works New York Times and is author of the book five days at Memorial

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
You can say it all began with

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
210

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
So this was back

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
1999

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:43,520
Us and other I think NATO allies were involved in a bombing campaign

12
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
In Serbia last gasps of war in the Forum

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
Yugoslavia you had Serbia attacking

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
Ethnic albanians in Kosovo

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
NATO was trying to protect them bombing Serbia

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,648
Which is creating a huge Exodus refugee

17
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Now Sherry

18
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
At the time was not yet

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Fully a reporter

20
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
She was

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Fresh out of med school

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
Volunteering at a human rights organization

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
Working on a book

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
About a war Hospital in Bosnia

25
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
And said she knew the landscape

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
She was able to convince this organization to let her go to Macedonia

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
The document what was happening

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
The document potential War crime

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,784
So I remember I went to the border of Kosovo Macedonia and

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
100000

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
Refugees had shown up

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
They were

33
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
Trying to cross the border into Macedonia

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
But the Macedonian government had

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
Closed its border with Kosovo so people who were

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
Fling got trap

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
They got stuck in this

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
Muddy no man's land between the two borders

39
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,872
Said police in riot gear were basically in lining the Macedonian side

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
She had all of these people

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
Crammed into this muddy Channel

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
And

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
The Macedonian Red Cross

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
And this one charity

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
Had gotten permission to

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Set up

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
Mix of medical station

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
In that border area

49
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Between

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
These two countries

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
This is sort of grumpy Brown Medical.

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Now Sherry was there

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
To conduct interview

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Nothing to do with medicine

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
I was there

56
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,104
To collect information but when I got there

57
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
I literally remember walking up to this border

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
And a doctor who I had interviewed previously this really tall

59
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Albanian Kosovo Albanian doctor looked out

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
And he told the Macedonian Border guard

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
Let her in we need her she's a doctor

62
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Describe being pulled into the 10

63
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,912
What's what you just said

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
Finish med school

65
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
Suddenly she says she was tossed in with all these War doctors

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
And here's the key

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Eventually she gets posted

68
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
At the door of the tent and what I ended up doing or what

69
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
They put me in charge of was

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Triage

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
No

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
It's a it's a French word

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Nice accent

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
I-88 means to sort or to sort for koala

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
Originally it was a reference to sorting coffee beans actually sweating different kinds of coffee

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
But a few hundred years ago the word started being applied to people to actually sorting different kinds of casualties

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Battlefield

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
I'm not suddenly what's her job

79
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
Literally I stood outside of this

80
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Makeshift

81
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Medical station

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,880
And every minute every couple minutes there would be another

83
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Patient brought

84
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
To the door of our Medical

85
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
And so my job was to stand outside that door and decide who gets in and who

86
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Who doesn't

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
How did you do that how did you make that choice

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
I don't remember having guidelines I remember just having to wing it

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
She said she just went on Insta

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
And so

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
The people who seem like they might be having a heart attack or seizure those were the ones who went into that

92
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
At 10th but you know people with physical disabilities know people who have chronic conditions psychiatric issue

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
Everybody else I had to direct

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
To this

95
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Other tents

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
And

97
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Someone

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
Ended up calling it the 10th of the Damned

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
I remember but peeling for help

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
From the Macedonian Health Ministry sing

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
No take these people into Macedonia they're not a threat

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
Open your border take them in they need

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Care

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
And

105
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
The health Ministry

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Refusing and so they stayed in this tent day after

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Today

108
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Sometimes for 4

109
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
5

110
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
6 days

111
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
And several the people in

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
This tent

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
They died

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Cherry says this experience

115
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Haunted

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
And years later

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,663
When she was a full-blown reporter and traveling all around the world looking at triage in different scenarios

118
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
She would return to this memory again and again in wonder

119
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
How

120
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Do people

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
In that situation make that decision how should they

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
Today a collaboration with the New York Giants wear

123
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Going to follow reporter Sheri Fink the ins-and-outs of triage in three different situations three

124
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,543
Different places in the world that she tries to understand what it means to play God

125
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,407
I'm jamming Rod I am Robert krulwich this is Radiolab

126
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Stay with us

127
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Always in case of water

128
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
Bailey when you were going to start with Coast level when did you as a writer be

129
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Well this

130
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
This

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
This Obsession of

132
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
About triage

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Came about when I was working on my

134
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Last book

135
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
Five days at Memorial which was about

136
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
Triage in the emergency in Hurricane Katrina

137
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
This is the scenario that people in New Orleans have been fearing for a long time

138
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:38,079
A category 5 hurricane headed right toward the city

139
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
I've heard the story of Katrina told and retold certainly it's hard not to think about now with what's happening

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Baton Rouge

141
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
But in this story

142
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
The hurricane is really just

143
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Really really focusing on one

144
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
This Hospital Memorial Medical

145
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Call Center built in 1920s

146
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
In one of the lowest parts

147
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
Types of that city which is really like a bull

148
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
Is a sturdy brick building a stories tall

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Stretching over two city blocks

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,359
Served in every storm until that point it was really seen it somewhere safe

151
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,391
And this Hospital became for Sherry a kind of portal into these questions about triage

152
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
She ended up spending six and a half years

153
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Interviewing doctors at the hospital patients nurses family members government officials ethicist Hospital

154
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,751
You know she conducted over 500 interviews to reconstruct moment for moment

155
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
What happened at the hospital during Hurricane

156
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,015
Get ready this the most intense part of the storm is getting ready to come across

157
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Day 1 Monday August 29th

158
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
2005

159
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Around 6 a.m.

160
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Katrina hit

161
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
I've never seen anything in my life like this and

162
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
They get through the storm okay

163
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
City power's gone but they've got their backup power

164
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
But this hospital it has a boner ability a lot of American hospitals have which is that they had moved the generator

165
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
To the second floor so that they would be higher up

166
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
Is playing but electricity is all about

167
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Circuits

168
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
And they had elements of that backup power system that were below

169
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,095
Flood level things like switches and other electrical material

170
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
But they got through the first day okay

171
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
And it seemed to that point that the worst was over

172
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
And then

173
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
When do the sun rise

174
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
Water surrounds this Hospital

175
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
But it feels New Orleans and as the Water started to rise around the hospital that is the moment

176
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
That the people in charge new

177
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
They were in big big trouble

178
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
They knew

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
What their vulnerability was

180
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
How many patients are in the hospital is it

181
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
There were

182
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
250 patients

183
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,103
They're about 2000 people because you had so many

184
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,711
Wow staff and then all the visitors who had come with the staff members and with

185
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
The patients

186
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
Sherry says mid-morning on that second day

187
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Tuesday August 30th

188
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Just as the waters are starting to rise

189
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
A group of doctors got together and they did come up with a system which evolved a little bit over the crisis

190
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
But stay

191
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Decided

192
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
First

193
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Get the babies out

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Get the critic

195
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Who care Patients Out

196
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Chandni

197
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Knew that they had

198
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
To high water truck

199
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,407
From the National Guard in the water wasn't so so high yet at that point it was only part way up

200
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
The sloping emergency room rap

201
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,271
And they decided to put patients who could walk on those

202
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
So

203
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Helicopter start to arrive

204
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,463
Medical staff start to bundle tiny babies in incubators

205
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
ICU patients in wheelchairs

206
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Onto the elevator

207
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
And up to the helipad

208
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
How many patients can a single helicopter take in like the ones that were Landing how many can they do one or two

209
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Slow going

210
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Yeah it was late evening

211
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,431
Before they got all the Intensive Care Unit Patients Out the babies and the babies

212
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
All in all that second day they evacuated about 60 people

213
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
60

214
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Critical path

215
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
Although we should also say that

216
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
If a patient has signed a DNR do not resuscitate

217
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Are the doctors decided those patient

218
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Should not go for

219
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
And they were held back

220
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Explain their thinking on that

221
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
OKC Darkness Falls Hyundai

222
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
2

223
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
The doctors and nurses are exhausted

224
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,383
They've been working really really hard carrying patients in the heat

225
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Many of them lay down on

226
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Cotton bacon bits

227
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
To rest for the night and then

228
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Before the sun rises 2 hours before about 2 a.m.

229
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,327
The buzz of the generators suddenly just

230
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Stopped

231
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Quiet

232
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
The water had reached

233
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
There's electrical switches in the base

234
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Doctor doctor cook

235
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:30,687
Yuan cook long-time ICU doctor he was lying not far from where those generators were

236
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
He said to me it was

237
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Quote the sickest

238
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Sound of a

239
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
His life

240
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Sound apps

241
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
And

242
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,951
That is when it became an absolute emergency in this house

243
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Pitch blackness

244
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
Some of the medical equipment they have backup batteries they started beeping

245
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
To warn that the electrical power heads

246
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,311
Stop you still had nine patients who relied on ventilators to breathe

247
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,175
It became a hive of activity at got to get everyone out everybody was

248
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Running around with flashlights

249
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Beams in the blackness

250
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,855
Trying desperately to move those patients

251
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
Down the stairs now there's no elevators that's the other big thing fortunately somebody found a hole in them

252
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,375
Machine room wall on the second floor that led directly to a parking garage

253
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
And so they figured out the path patients through this roughly 3 by 3 foot hold on to the

254
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
The back of a pickup truck drive them up

255
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
To the 8th story of that parking garage and then carry them up three rickety lights of

256
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Steps to the

257
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Formerly unused helipad

258
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
And

259
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Five of the nine

260
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Patients on ventilators died

261
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
Just right then

262
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Just like I said I've been trying to

263
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
I want to make

264
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
This is tape of an interview that Sherry did back in 2018 she was doing research

265
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Story

266
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
My name is Gina

267
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
Gina was a nursing director working on the 7th floor of the hospital that day she text me to tending to those now

268
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
9 patients that didn't make the first helicopter run

269
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
And she described to Sherry that right

270
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,303
After the power went out and after the ventilator shutdown

271
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
One of her patients Flatline

272
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
And um

273
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
The guy in back

274
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
We had fun out of oxygen

275
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
That's what you've been told

276
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
And so we brought him down

277
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Stairs

278
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
2 second floor

279
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,599
They brought him down in the dark and then got in line to wait for their turn to go through the hole in the wall

280
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
To the heliport

281
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
And she says that since his ventilator wasn't working any

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
The whole time they were standing there they had the hands

283
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Squeezes ventilator

284
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Keybar

285
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Tony to his lungs

286
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
You know he kept twitching in

287
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Oxygen

288
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Television line

289
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
And it was my turn at the window

290
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
One of the Physicians came over

291
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
You do know that he needs oxygen

292
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Yes sir

293
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
They don't have any eyes

294
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
We can't get any

295
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
And at that point

296
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Are you do this

297
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Why did you just let him go

298
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
He was right

299
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Me to do it with neurologic

300
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Going to make it without it

301
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Massages

302
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Argument

303
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Shopkins hair

304
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
I waited

305
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Had to take him out

306
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Of the Boiler Room

307
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Odin

308
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Log was full

309
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
The chaplain came over to

310
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Took the body into the chapel

311
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
And he just how bad

312
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Aetna

313
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
What do you laugh I just said that

314
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
A few minutes

315
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Try to compose

316
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
I doubt people

317
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Say people

318
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
You know

319
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Just not enough

320
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
Everything you've done is just not enough

321
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Day 3

322
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Wednesday August 31st

323
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
2005

324
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Sunrises

325
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
And

326
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
That's when

327
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
There

328
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Expecting all the helicopters come back

329
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
They wait

330
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
And they wait

331
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Anyway

332
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
And an occasional helicopter comes

333
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
But this

334
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,999
Concerted rescue efforts that had taken place the evening before

335
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Has stopped

336
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Now

337
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
We know now looking back

338
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
Did on that Wednesday the helicopters were doing their own triage

339
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Rescuing people from looking at people on rooftops waving rags

340
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
The people inside the hospital

341
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
Most of them had no idea

342
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
All the new

343
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Was

344
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
We're in this horrific situation

345
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
Where are the helicopters

346
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
At this point they're still nearly 200 patients at the

347
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
And

348
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Some of the staff

349
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
Panics because it takes them so long to move the patients

350
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
2

351
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,287
The top of the parking garage just below that helipad

352
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
So she says on that third day at about 7 in the morning

353
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Bunch of doctors in hospital administrator

354
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Maybe a dozen

355
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Dozen and a half

356
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
They got together and they decided that they needed a system

357
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
The way of organizing their patients so that when those helicopter

358
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Started to show up again

359
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
They wouldn't waste any time at all.

360
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
I know exactly who to evacuate in what order

361
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Another words

362
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Who are we going to get out

363
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,447
That was the question and that's the moment where they come up with the ones

364
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Twos and threes

365
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
This is

366
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Triage

367
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,407
There are a limited number of resources in this case helicopters in a few boats

368
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
And we have to decide which people get access

369
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Castillo's resources

370
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
There are a couple of ways to look at this

371
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
Siri says if you go back to the very beginning of triage

372
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
The first conception of it 1790

373
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
Napoleon's Chief surgeon

374
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Baron Larry I think

375
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Give me the rule

376
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
On the battlefield

377
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
That you take the people were in the acute need first

378
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
So the tickets are going to be treated first

379
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
And with the most resource

380
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,919
And this is the way it works in most emergency rooms there's a long waiting line

381
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Hotspot

382
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
If you got a heart attack you get right to the front of the line

383
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
Another way to look at it is the utilitarian concept

384
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
It's got its start with some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries

385
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
The core of this idea seems simple

386
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Try to do the greatest good

387
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
You want to maximize some sort of

388
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Good outcome amongst

389
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
The population

390
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,471
So rather than think about what one individual needs you think

391
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
How can I save the most

392
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
Number of lives are the most number of years

393
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
I'm going to Max my years of life we might

394
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,991
Want to pick people who are have a better chance of surviving or younger people

395
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
And this method of triage

396
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
Swear you often see in a war zone where I say there's a bombing

397
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
And you have

398
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
More injured victims than there are ambulances hermetics

399
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
So 1

400
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
3

401
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
Imagine a library in a hospital waiting area

402
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,239
Cherry says in this case with the doctors did they ask the staff

403
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
To get everyone out of their rooms

404
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
Bring them down to that second floor Lobby

405
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,151
And then some doctors including one whose name

406
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,735
Might be relevant for later dr. Ana Polo

407
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
She and another doctor

408
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
They stationed themselves

409
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,231
On the landing where the patients were brought down to on that second floor and as the nurses would bring them

410
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
They would look

411
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
Quickly at the patient's chart look at

412
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Patient and decide on a number

413
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
And the nurses would take magic marker and a piece

414
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
Paper and write either one two or three on that paper

415
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
And then she says

416
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
They would take that number

417
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Onto the patient's gown

418
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
So the ones

419
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Where you're relatively healthy patients

420
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
Patient maybe who had an appendicitis and their appendix out there

421
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
Looking good they could even be discharged

422
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
The ones would be rescued by boat presumably among the first

423
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
The twos were you're more typical Hospital patient

424
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
Patient maybe who had a heart attack who wasn't

425
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
Fully recovered who

426
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Would need

427
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Ongoing care

428
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
They would go by helicopter presumably second

429
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
And industries were those

430
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
Super sick patients or anyone with a do not resuscitate order

431
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Those patients are golang

432
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
One of the doctors when I said

433
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Why did you choose

434
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
The sickest patients to go last

435
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
One of them said while I figured

436
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
Anyone with a do not resuscitate order

437
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Would have a

438
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,487
Terminal or irreversible condition which by the way isn't always the case

439
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
And he said I thought that that patient would have

440
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Quote the least to lose

441
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
So it sounds like in some way they went to more of a utilitarian wave

442
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Yeah

443
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
And you could see everything that follows

444
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Flowing from

445
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Utilitarian decision and actually made it a few different

446
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
Prioritize the healthiest people first

447
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
And the sickest people laugh

448
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
He's choices ultimately did become

449
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Very consequential

450
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
10 case all three groups

451
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
Are placed in different parts of the hospital

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
And the threes were kept in the lobby

453
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
The second floor Lobby

454
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
To jest

455
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Wait

456
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
So as the day goes on the area started to get really full

457
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Patient next

458
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
The patient on these cots

459
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:49,440
She says you had about 18 people lined up side-by-side and Caesar

460
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
People with heart conditions symptoms of pneumonia

461
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Stroke there were nurses

462
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
It just

463
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
But it was so so hot

464
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Some people gas

465
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,264
The temperature inside the building must have been on

466
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
I don't know if there's any way for me to do

467
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Describe to you

468
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
How intense the heat was

469
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,736
This is doctor anapo in an interview with 60 minutes

470
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Choose one of the doctors who

471
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
It was relentless

472
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
It was suffocating

473
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
It made it extremely difficult to breathe

474
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
And with the heat

475
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
The terrible smell

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,144
Started to smell really bad and the bathroom

477
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Sewage was sort of backing up in the toilet and they just say it's the word everywhere

478
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
On the ground everywhere

479
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Personally I didn't want to eat or drink anything cuz I didn't want to have to use the bathroom

480
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
As the day went on some people started really feeling abandoned

481
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
Why are they here why aren't they helping us

482
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
On the 7th floor

483
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
Weather was this radio that was playing in the quarter

484
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
8 minutes

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,568
Iww local talk stations and the radio was

486
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
One of the only ways they were getting information from the outside

487
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
The rage is growing among some of the nurses have carts that they would roll around and they have the little radio

488
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
On the cart and they'd be listening jungle human instincts are beginning to creep in and

489
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,912
Nevertales on the radio that were alarming the stash merchandise

490
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
These people should be shocked that turned out not to be true like

491
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
Had declared martial law

492
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,432
There was literally a deputy sheriff

493
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,552
Who got on there and told people that

494
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
He saw a shark

495
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,904
Swimming around a hotel there walking like zombies

496
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Five nights of the Living Dead that whole imagine how that would feel if you were in this hospital that was the only word you were having

497
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,376
About what was going on outside

498
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Just Like Heaven

499
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Breakdown

500
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Freaking out

501
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
In the garage

502
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
Buy afternoon of that third day that Wednesday

503
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
Some of the staff for having nervous breakdowns

504
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
Morales really really low because

505
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
All these patients are still there Bass

506
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
Patients were so hot you know they were just kind of drift off to

507
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Sleepy have to wake him up

508
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
And make them take sips of water

509
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
Subservient

510
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Whatever we had you know

511
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
City of New Orleans will never be the same

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
Help someone while crying for their mom

513
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
One of the nurse

514
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Told me she was worried that they could be brain damage

515
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Lasting effects

516
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Afdah

517
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Severe overheating

518
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
So there's this level of

519
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Of panic

520
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,320
There is also the situation of the pets

521
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
And

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
This may make no sense

523
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
Too much people but

524
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
They would offer staff members

525
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
They could bring their pets

526
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
If they were coming in to work

527
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,120
Storm and they turned medical records over into a kennel

528
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
And

529
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
People start to worry about their

530
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
Apparently on that Wednesday one of the larger.

531
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
What's a Newfoundland

532
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Started having seizures from the Heat

533
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
So

534
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Some of the staff

535
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Chose to have

536
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Doctors euthanized

537
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
And then just

538
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Try to imagine if you can

539
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Looters are running free

540
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
Hot people are dying your hair gunshots in the neighborhood you're afraid

541
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
I don't know if there's real violence breaking out in

542
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
City

543
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,032
Stop floating in the water there how many rescue resources are going to come tonight time

544
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,616
And your colleague walks up to you and says

545
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Do you know

546
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
For euthanizing

547
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Pets to put them out of their misery

548
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
What about the suffering patient

549
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Shouldn't we put some of them

550
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Out of their misery

551
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,816
And I interviewed all these people and trying to figure out like where did this idea

552
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,376
Come from and tracing it back and there were all these

553
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,936
Little informal conversations

554
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
And

555
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,336
This starts just going around the hospital

556
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
The sort of idea

557
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
Of putting patients out of their misery

558
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't know who told me that

559
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
But that's what I heard

560
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
And you know in those

561
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Circumstances

562
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
What are you doing

563
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,720
If you're at War and you have someone

564
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
It's not going to be picked

565
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Safety

566
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
Live leading the deaf

567
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
What are you doing

568
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
Cherry says that as this idea spread around the hospital

569
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
People fell into different camps

570
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Some people thought this was

571
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
The most Humane thing they

572
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Do

573
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
It would be criminal to let people

574
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Will suffer more

575
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Other people when they heard about it

576
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
We're outraged

577
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,792
For example dr. Bryant King who's colleague doctor

578
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
Fournier

579
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
She walks up to him and

580
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Says there's this

581
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Discussion going on and you know what do you think and he says

582
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Idea

583
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
This is Doc

584
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,432
Burger King in an interview on CNN

585
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
Day for Thursday September 1st

586
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Here's would end up

587
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
And accounts here are

588
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
The vegan industry

589
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
According to dr. King who spoke about this

590
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Json CNN

591
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
He says

592
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
And other people say

593
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Say they saw this as well

594
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
He said he saw one of the doctors we talked about earlier

595
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,056
Dr. Ana Polo who still there that Thursday morning

596
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Caring for patients please

597
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
Patience on the second floor

598
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
Who were chosen to go last

599
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
He says he saw her

600
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Talking to patients

601
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
While holding a handful of syringe

602
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,368
Anna standing over there with handful of syringes talking to a patient

603
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
And

604
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
Herbivores

605
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
That I heard her say were

606
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
I want to give you something to make you feel better

607
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Macy had a handful of syringes I don't

608
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
And

609
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,984
Nobody nobody walks around with a handful of syringes and goes and gets the same thing these patient that this is not how we do it

610
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
Jump forward 4 be after this whole ordeal was over and the rescue teams in the

611
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
Mortuary teams arrived

612
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
Many bodies were found in this house

613
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Hospital

614
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
About 45 bodies found

615
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
And so there was an investigation launched

616
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
They found these bodies

617
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
They tested these bodies for drugs

618
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,560
And what they found was that nearly two dozen patients had received

619
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Either morphine or versed

620
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
A powerful sedative

621
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Or combination of the two

622
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,568
In a very short time. On that Thursday September 1st 2005

623
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
It was

624
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
I think 21 in the end

625
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
But

626
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
It's complicated

627
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
In medicine

628
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
What is Comfort Inn what is murder

629
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
Depends to a large degree

630
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
On the intentions of the doctor

631
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,720
It's called the principle of the double effect is sometimes credited to St Thomas

632
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Aquinas

633
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
And

634
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
It's this idea that

635
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
An act

636
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,400
It's that that can cause harm but if your intention is to do good

637
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Ethical

638
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,776
Dr Anna Poe those patients

639
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
As the Attorney General

640
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
No

641
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
I did not

642
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Murder

643
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Those patient

644
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
I don't want everybody to know

645
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
That I am not a murderer

646
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
That we

647
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Or not

648
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Murderous

649
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
In that 60 Minutes interview dr. Pope

650
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Flatly denies euthanizing anybody

651
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,000
Various points in the interview she is

652
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Clearly distraught

653
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
At the accusation

654
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
It completely

655
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Ripped

656
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
My heart out

657
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
Because my entire

658
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Life

659
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
I've tried to do good

660
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Am I tired all life

661
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
I have given everything that I have Within Me

662
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
To take care of

663
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Of my patience

664
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
Mishary did talk to One doctor dr. Ewing

665
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
We mentioned him earlier when we were talking about the other generators

666
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
He's a doctor who do you love

667
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
End-of-life

668
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
He was very open with her

669
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
About the decision

670
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
He had gone upstairs visited mrs. progess

671
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Canterbury

672
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
2

673
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
See how she was doing and he was just thinking to himself

674
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,728
She's so so sick she's got Advanced cancer

675
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,824
I can't imagine she would have more than maybe a week to live at the best

676
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
Circumstances

677
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,200
She is weighted down with fluid which can happen for the end of life

678
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
So she weighs a lot

679
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
She's on the 8th floor

680
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
So we'd have to

681
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:52,416
Carry her downstairs and plus there's four nurses up here taking care of her

682
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,024
Could we use them somewhere else so he literally turned to one of the nurses and said

683
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Can you give her enough morphine till she goes

684
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
And that nurse charting

685
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Huge

686
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
Increasing

687
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Morphine

688
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
For her and she died

689
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
And

690
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
That was

691
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,480
Thought so he made this decision until this day or at least the last time we spoke he felt he did the right thing

692
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:21,088
He said to me he thought it was desperate he saw only two choices Quicken their deaths

693
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Or abandon them

694
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,696
I mean if that was the real situation there's some at the sea

695
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,256
This would say either of those choices would be

696
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
No not justified but excusable

697
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
But one of the arguments you could make

698
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Is that when you give up on one person

699
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Then becomes

700
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
A little bit easier to give up on the next

701
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
And then the next

702
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
First and then suddenly you're on the slippery slope

703
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
Ensure he did tell us about this one

704
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
His case was very haunting

705
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
Emmett Everett 61 year old

706
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
Doting grandfather

707
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Very very heavy

708
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,600
He weighed 380 lb and he was up on the 7th floor of the hospital

709
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
He was conscious alert

710
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Set himself breakfast

711
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
Baptist nurses are we ready to rock and roll

712
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
He said to one nurse

713
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
Poop never forgot it

714
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:07,168
Cindy don't let them leave me behind don't let them leave me behind

715
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
He had had a spinal cord

716
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
Stroke he couldn't walk

717
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,592
He was on the 7th floor of the hospital with no working elevators

718
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,176
And the staff told me they couldn't imagine how they would

719
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
To carry him down

720
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Those flights

721
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,552
Upstairs let alone with a helicopter take a man of his size

722
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,928
And he was one of the patients who was found with this drug combination in his body

723
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
David Bowie died

724
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
He.

725
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
Found his body was found

726
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,864
And by the way the other tragedy was just as those injections took

727
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
The place was when the helicopter

728
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Finally we're folks

729
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Gaston the song

730
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
Did a judge or jury find anyone guilty of manslaughter or murder or

731
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Second degree murder

732
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
No nobody

733
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,648
And again just to remind you how quickly

734
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
A hospital can go from a normal American

735
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,768
Well-regarded functioning Hospital

736
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
To a place where this was even

737
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Considered

738
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Cast

739
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Was so short

740
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,960
Monday morning the storm hits Tuesday Morning the water rises

741
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
Early Wednesday morning all power goes out

742
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
And this is Thursday

743
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Kind of chilling to think

744
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,840
God of all of that begin with a triage decision about which patients

745
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Should go first

746
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
I'm trying to put myself in the position of the

747
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
People at that hospital

748
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
I'm thinking to myself

749
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
How do you guys have like a checklist

750
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
Make a checklist on a wall that says here's how you do this so that I can just check the boxes

751
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
I wouldn't be able to take my way through that so that's where I go next

752
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
I wonder

753
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,392
Wasn't this story you've just told us bleeds us anywhere the first place it would lead me

754
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Would be to ask

755
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
Is there a system that people could set up

756
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:12,096
People are reasonable and who have the expectation of something like this is going to happen again

757
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Somehow somewhere

758
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Maybe in my town my hospital my

759
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
So what could we do

760
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
To make this now

761
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
Well it's interesting you ask because of course after Katrina there have been efforts since then to come up with a protocol

762
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,040
Going to share the experience and Katrina was basically a wake-up call for

763
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Doctors in

764
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Hospitals

765
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
State governments to think about

766
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,208
Triage like how should we ration medical resource

767
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
Something bad happens again

768
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Which patients we prioritize

769
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
First which patients don't we prioritize

770
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
How do we do this

771
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
And

772
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,240
One of the interesting things was that the state of Maryland decided

773
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,360
We're going to throw this open to our population and have what they called deliberative democracy

774
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,944
So pull people together in a room from all walks of life

775
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
And have them grapple with

776
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
And

777
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,344
I was there oh you went to the very first one

778
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Did I mention like a town hall meeting was it like that

779
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Or no

780
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah, just imagine the church basement

781
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
Intercity Baltimore or a conference room in Bobby Howard County

782
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Saturday

783
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,336
What we think is a really really important conversation

784
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
Refreshments

785
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
At about 12:15

786
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,224
Will take a break for you all to get lunch bring it back to you

787
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
People have been recruited to be a part of this and when I say people it's just regular folks

788
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
So that researchers let's call them that they get people together and

789
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Good morning

790
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,728
Set the sort of scenario is laid out

791
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,544
Skin and we're going to be talking about today is

792
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
How we make decisions about

793
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Who gets life-saving resource

794
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,016
In a situation when you literally cannot take care of everyone

795
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
Today the scenario will talk about is pandemic influenza tell people okay imagine a flu is sweeping

796
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,208
In the country

797
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Millions of people are sick

798
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,096
Coughing some are dying the only way the folks are going to get better they say

799
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,192
Is it they have a ventilator to help them breathe but the problem is

800
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,032
There just aren't enough.

801
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
This is a terrible situation were talking about so here you have too many patients too few resources

802
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
How do we choose

803
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Who gets those ventilators

804
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Might be the right

805
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
The researchers then essentially layout three different kinds of options

806
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
Number one

807
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
Try to save the most lives or years of Life by picking people the best chance of surviving the pandemic

808
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
And later see young people or healthier people

809
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,984
Number to bacon people who will be the most helpful during the pandemic

810
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
So First Responders Health Care Providers vaccine work

811
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Four number three

812
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,992
Something like first-come first-serve or a lottery

813
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
See people that make sense

814
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Okay

815
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,952
And then they say we're here to answer your questions Talk Amongst yourself

816
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,816
You know

817
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
Where it was or what

818
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:40,736
What my immediate reaction to the lottery was

819
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
It's a leveler

820
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:48,160
It's all the same I think it is typically least responsible way to go

821
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
Ultimately it's fair if somebody's going to live but the very sick is that should that go into the decision

822
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,960
If we set of guidelines then yes if every kind of doctor you know what I mean going to be essential

823
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:07,360
Now the good news is a ventilator and a four-year-old wouldn't I just think that would be this.

824
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
People are willing to engage in this question

825
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,576
And this was right at the time you guys remember all the Death panel discussion

826
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,696
Sarah Palin

827
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,840
In black and white started at that time

828
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
And the word emphasize

829
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
But as you can also hear

830
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:42,432
You get it first because you'd and I got there half a second and I are there wasn't a lot

831
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Lot of agreement

832
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
I respect your opinion but I'm just dealing with

833
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,952
I suppose there's no room for emotion

834
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
Dubai person-to-person is exception to the rule that's emotion coffee

835
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,960
Anything that's going on and that's why we have those setup

836
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
It's one of the

837
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,104
The big findings was that there are certain ways in which we will not make these

838
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,968
There were things that the researchers wanted to be off the table like not even

839
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
Come into the

840
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Discussion

841
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:24,160
We're not going to make decisions based on gender race socioeconomic status like people's jobs and ink

842
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
Comes and citizenship status

843
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,608
You know whether they had a criminal history or were they upstanding members of society

844
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Just want to say upfront that's not

845
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
That's not up for grabs

846
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
But those things kept popping up

847
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,872
You wouldn't have it like a young pastor and you might have a reprehensible

848
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,200
Alcoholic criminal type person

849
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,040
And he might have more years to live

850
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:55,136
Pastor are going to be more beneficial

851
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:01,536
Societies in the ears of a criminal reprehensible alcoholic

852
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
Well you are

853
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
Australian territories

854
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
That is it

855
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
Dad is a personalized there were people who thought that undocumented immigrants shouldn't get ventilators

856
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
Alcoholic smokers the world will be a better place

857
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
Do you deserve to survive

858
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,440
Can I say to you but should I try and save you

859
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
What's interesting is that

860
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,632
People really comfortable making utilitarian choices like saying yeah that person should get the ventilator because

861
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
They're going to benefit the greater good in some way

862
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
But if that ever got formulated in a slightly different way which is to say that person should get the ventilator because they deserve

863
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,688
Bit more than another their life has more value

864
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Another person

865
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Well then people like

866
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
We're not cool

867
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
And yet you would hear people say it that way again and again and then immediately be repulsed

868
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
When they heard someone else

869
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Say that way

870
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,816
I don't think you can determine who's done what in their life and how that valuable I might think

871
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,912
My hairdresser is more important

872
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,520
All right I want to look for during my pants at my situation

873
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
And this was particularly acute when participants were asked the second

874
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
Controversial topics really hard question

875
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,576
Would it be acceptable to you do you think it's acceptable to ever

876
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
Remove a ventilator from one patient

877
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
To give it to somebody else

878
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,256
This one I definitely don't have a clear answer myself

879
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Some people

880
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Fayetteville

881
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,656
Of course. Doesn't seem like someone is going to make it through the treatments

882
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Then we need to

883
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,800
Kevin cut their treatment short in Kansai ventilator on a someone else but

884
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
You're going to murder my father they were other people who said no

885
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:00,063
You are going to be

886
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,463
I've never going to sign up for that

887
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
So

888
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Complicate

889
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,399
Did they come to a conclusion

890
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Hear a conclusion

891
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
I listen to this

892
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Here's what I heard I heard

893
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
Thoughtful people

894
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Struggling with a problem that is so

895
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Hard to struggle with

896
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,015
At what the end up doing is going I don't know how I don't want to do this

897
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,855
I pay no attention to your guidelines cuz I can't deal with what I loved about it

898
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
The number one response was

899
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Try to get out of this

900
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Situation and

901
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,767
Find ways to avoid having to ration

902
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,351
That's the most important part of this

903
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
What is it the researchers are going to take away from all this

904
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,239
Well a couple of things that they got out of it

905
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Number one

906
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,567
Remember we talked about the different ways of

907
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
Deciding that they put out for people to discuss well it turns out they wanted to combine some of those

908
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
Different perspectives and they carry a lot of people

909
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
Thought sure let's start out utilitarian let's try and

910
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,439
Save the most Lies by picking the people who are most likely to survive

911
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
If they're likely to survive and they need it

912
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,583
But chances are they're going to be a lot of people who fit in that category

913
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,983
So if everybody is just about the same as we can't we don't have like great science that allows us to know which patient

914
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
It is going to survive and which ones not going to

915
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
The 4th at 2nd tier

916
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,175
Let's do it randomly let's just being really really fair and give everyone an equal chance

917
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
So it's like you introduce a little bit of faith.

918
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Keep things on

919
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:37,343
Exactly and that in the research you said you know what this is a good idea let's see if we could

920
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
Maybe put this concept into the protocol

921
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,535
Am I right in thinking that these guidelines whatever they end up being are designed to avoid that sort of like

922
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Sorting based on

923
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
Who deserves a new does

924
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
Yeah I mean

925
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
There's some fairness

926
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
And having

927
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Guidelines

928
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,799
Especially guidelines that were developed with the input of lots of people

929
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
So even if

930
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
We don't like

931
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
The choices

932
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
That are made and we

933
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,247
Don't end up getting the ventilator where our loved one doesn't

934
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:10,111
Overall if you know that there's a protocol out there and this is the rule

935
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
Here's why we had to adopt this rule

936
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
It's being applied to everybody and you're not

937
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
Canby advantage or disadvantage

938
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
Over money or over of these

939
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Other sayings

940
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,143
It sort of helps you accepted

941
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,215
My in theory that sounds

942
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
Plausible

943
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,543
But when you put Theory to practice

944
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
That's what you can do

945
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Right after the break

946
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Things get

947
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Very

948
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
Heart

949
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
That's coming up

950
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295
This is Jerome calling from Silver Spring Maryland Radiolab

951
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
Supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the

952
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,583
Modern world more information about Sloan and www.delone.org

953
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,935
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

954
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
And I'm here because I need your help

955
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,919
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

956
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Aunts and uncles teachers

957
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,783
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

958
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
Basically I want to hear about this

959
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
I kid you know did something

960
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,719
It just means you lean back and say

961
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Well

962
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,119
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading

963
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
Back to you

964
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

965
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Or maybe the kids in math

966
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,663
Music in the margin of their geometry

967
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
We're interested in the

968
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Specific moments where

969
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,807
Kid does something super smart

970
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

971
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
If you have a story

972
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Go to radiolab.org

973
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
Flash brilliance

974
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
Record a short audio message

975
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
And that's where you're at. Org / really

976
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Thank you so much

977
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab and returning now to our collaboration with a New York time

978
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
Times Reporter Sheri Fink

979
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,951
Our final stop many ways are hard to stop

980
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Cuz

981
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
It's the closest we're going to come to stir the

982
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Heart

983
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Of the issues we've been talking about

984
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
And you realize that when you get

985
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Close

986
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Pictures about 2

987
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
Sometimes what

988
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
What's a success what's a failure

989
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Hard to measure

990
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:16,735
Test

991
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:21,087
I remember being in Haiti after the Haiti earthquake

992
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
Back in 2010

993
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,583
I was embedded with a group of us disaster responders

994
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
The International Medical and surgical Response Team insert

995
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
10th hospital and AT-AT

996
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,871
Point maybe about a week and a half after the earthquake there were

997
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,687
So so many casualties

998
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
Thousand people could be dead

999
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
A patient kind of lined up in a row

1000
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,279
Festering wounds open fractures and they didn't have enough resources and they were running out of

1001
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Oxygen tanks

1002
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,191
And then they were also trying to use these oxygen concentrators with pull oxygen from the environment

1003
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,799
But they rely on Power and they was running out of diesel for the generators

1004
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
Logistics where the critical level with our diesel Supply and oxygen for the

1005
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,599
So I'm freaking today I mean I am freaking pray for us and Logistics today

1006
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,719
This was a hospital that had

1007
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:36,351
Set up to do surgery they needed oxygen they didn't have enough so the question became

1008
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
Who were they going to give it to and who were they not

1009
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,823
At one point when I see you

1010
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,151
We walked into this tent

1011
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
And we met this woman

1012
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
She had braided hair a white nightgown on and this too

1013
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
Running into her nose

1014
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
How old are you

1015
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
What's the same age how are you feeling today

1016
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,343
Good of a bad if I say in speaking to her I found out that she was from Port-au-Prince the

1017
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
And that during the earthquake

1018
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
Her house had collapsed

1019
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,743
Everyone inside it she said

1020
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
Which is most of her extended family

1021
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
The guide

1022
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,727
Live in yesterday between Ocala

1023
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:52,127
So sorry she told me that amazingly she had survived

1024
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
Italian-American

1025
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,807
She wasn't at home when the earthquake hit she checked into this Hospital

1026
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,647
Very shortly before the earthquake happened because she had had chronic

1027
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
Lung problems so

1028
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,975
She was there to get treatment

1029
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
And after the earthquake She was transferred to this American Hospital. How do you feel about the treatment that you got here

1030
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:19,775
Way better than

1031
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:26,175
Anywhere that she's been.

1032
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:38,975
I'm in charge of all the thing that's going on

1033
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:45,375
I'm happy to see a smile on your face

1034
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
I started to speak with the staff about her even taking care of her

1035
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,615
When I found out that Natalie had just

1036
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,175
Who won the hearts of the surgical staff there

1037
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:04,831
People loved her she was so thankful but she has a chronic illness which is severe heart failure

1038
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:09,695
Hypertension in pregnancy relief

1039
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
They told me they had plans to

1040
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Take her off

1041
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Oxygen

1042
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,167
They were going to turn down the oxygen slowly

1043
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
To try to make it

1044
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
More comfortable

1045
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
And then they were going to send her off

1046
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,359
Patient facility that didn't have oxygen but where she would

1047
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
Presumably die

1048
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
And

1049
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
If your thinking in terms of cold hard

1050
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
Triage Theory

1051
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:39,647
You know this makes sense because they were trying to save oxygen she has a chronic problem that probably won't get better so that's

1052
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
The theory of it

1053
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
But the practice of it

1054
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Was quite different

1055
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,839
She absolutely no idea that they were about to do this

1056
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
She

1057
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,263
Had all this hope for her funeral

1058
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
Have an opportunity to earn a living

1059
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:08,063
Once you do the hospital is there any way possible that the people would give her like somewhere to stay.

1060
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,463
I mean I'm a journalist and I don't know the answer to that but

1061
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
I don't know what to say it's such a hard situation right now and I remember the nurse who was

1062
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Doing the triage

1063
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Should made that

1064
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,311
Decision to cut off her oxygen on the team

1065
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
I've never met her

1066
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
I never met the patient

1067
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:38,015
But that's the role that a net we're running out of oxygen

1068
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
The country itself doesn't have oxygen so I have to make the decision no she can't have KNOX

1069
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
I have to look at the greater

1070
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
Good that we can provide

1071
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,839
With the limited resources we have

1072
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
And so

1073
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,519
Then I followed that woman

1074
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
I wanted to see

1075
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,711
Just on a human level as well as on the abstract level

1076
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:14,111
The Transporters came a few hours later

1077
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
That service

1078
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:21,279
Amazing and they came to pick her up

1079
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
She was on oxygen

1080
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Okay we're going to

1081
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,631
Are there portable oxygen tanks

1082
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:31,263
And the representative from the hospital said oh no

1083
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:38,431
She doesn't get oxygen so they yanked the oxygen

1084
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:43,039
Toronto structure

1085
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,855
Lifted her up

1086
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
Stuck on the back of this Humvee ambulance

1087
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,607
Cargo Humvee

1088
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
I rode with her

1089
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
She started getting short of breath

1090
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:19,135
American oxygen

1091
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:25,535
Put his asthma inhaler in her mouth and she kept hitting it over and over again she thought it was oxygen

1092
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
Twitterrific

1093
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
To watch her start to suffer

1094
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,911
I felt complicit

1095
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,007
I was doing a story and I knew very well

1096
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
That

1097
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
They had chosen for her to

1098
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
To die and

1099
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
Just watching didn't feel

1100
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
It didn't feel right

1101
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
And so sorry

1102
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,327
Stopped at this hospital and I nodded over toward her and some of the medical staff when

1103
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,727
To look at her

1104
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:12,127
She was really struggling to breathe but then

1105
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,943
I saw one of my medical school professors

1106
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,991
Emergency doctor in

1107
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,575
I told him about her

1108
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
Cooking Mama

1109
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
And

1110
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,263
Supervise

1111
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
Tricks to get fluid off of lung and he found one

1112
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:52,063
Think of oxygen that had a teeny bit life in it

1113
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,463
Okay

1114
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:10,495
He was able to extend her life

1115
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
Ultimately I actually

1116
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,647
Felt responsibility for her that outlasted

1117
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:32,255
The story that I did and so after that came out I

1118
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,815
I did attempt to help her

1119
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Really yeah

1120
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Well

1121
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,191
I found a

1122
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,591
Charitable group that was willing to bring her to the US under a certain type of Visa program that allowed for

1123
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
Humanitarian

1124
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,919
I'd like a Medical Treatments

1125
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
And

1126
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,295
That the cardiologist who had examined her and Haiti had thought she had a

1127
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
Rheumatic heart

1128
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,903
Disease that was causing her lung problems and that it could be

1129
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,463
Surgically corrected but when she came to the US

1130
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
In fact

1131
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,303
It was found that she had much more serious

1132
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,399
Condition and she really needed a transplant and she

1133
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Didn't

1134
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Didn't make it

1135
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
Does this make you

1136
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Wonder

1137
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
So you've got a rule

1138
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,967
And maybe in some Broadway it's helping but

1139
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
In that

1140
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Vehicle looking at

1141
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
This woman

1142
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
You wanted to

1143
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
Break the rules

1144
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Premier League

1145
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
Moral and decent reason

1146
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
In these extreme circumstance

1147
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
This is where life and death

1148
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Wrestling

1149
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Each other

1150
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Can you make

1151
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Rules

1152
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
I mean I am because

1153
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
It's like you can't fall if you offer taking her off yet

1154
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,127
And you can't fault you for trying to get her on the ox

1155
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,455
What's the conclusion to draw

1156
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,039
Well let's not give up you know the conclusion is let's not give up

1157
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,159
Like it turns out there was there were options for this woman it turns out that somebody

1158
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,719
Was able to extend her life now you could

1159
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:12,351
Very well argue that she should have died in that moment because look at all the resources that were spent

1160
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:17,727
But I just feel like like there was some value in her existence there was so much value

1161
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:24,127
She came to the US and my God she took up a collection for all the patients back in the Haitian.

1162
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,407
Hospital who she was friends with

1163
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,711
She contributed till the day she died

1164
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:34,367
She changed my life too so I don't know how to do the math on this one you know the problem

1165
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,767
Guidelines require like a lack of compassion the cold hard rigidness of it and

1166
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,559
Everything your tiny butt has to do with compassion

1167
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
This is Simon Adler by the way our producer

1168
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,959
And how do you make compassion work on that large of a scale

1169
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,847
Without caring about people and then you care about some people more than other people in the night

1170
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,687
Check now or never hurting people so very good point

1171
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,015
If you don't systematized it you you risk

1172
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,879
Choosing people based on factors that are really not fair

1173
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,207
Spider-Man does Wonder like what if Natalie weren't such a nice person

1174
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Wood

1175
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,047
Her without a change things

1176
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:20,447
Well you know if Natalie was a mean person that I don't think I would have felt any better watching her suffer its

1177
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,495
It's just about the person in front of you

1178
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:28,895
And I think that the more unbearable it is so the more you have to look someone in the eyes the more

1179
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
It makes us

1180
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:34,527
Try to figure out creative ways to avoid doing it

1181
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:40,671
You you somehow refusing to acknowledge the subject when it really really gets tough

1182
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
Avoid that

1183
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:50,143
Over and over again let's not facing the real problem which is that it's a problem to have to ration

1184
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:56,287
We're not going to figure out the best way to ration because there is no one best way because everyone in society will have a different view on that

1185
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:01,663
I think that's in some way unimpeachable I think you're absolutely right we should always strive to not have to make the

1186
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,967
We do have to make the choice

1187
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
How do we do it

1188
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,063
Well that's a very tough question

1189
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,159
Let me tell you that I think what you hit upon here

1190
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
Is an impossible

1191
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
Piece of human piss

1192
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,815
Rationing triage whatever you call it

1193
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
Is a NeNe

1194
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
Human act which

1195
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Humans

1196
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,007
Are trying to do but if the fact of their Humanity makes it

1197
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Impossible

1198
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Toby got here is because

1199
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
In a real deep problem

1200
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,687
We have a god roll

1201
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
And nobody fits it

1202
01:00:54,399 --> 01:01:00,543
We have so many people to thank for this hour

1203
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,175
I will start with Lily Sullivan and Pat Walters for really getting us thinking about all of this

1204
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:12,063
Thank you Lily thank you Pat thank you also to PRI the world a version of Haiti story first appeared on that show
