1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
And NPR

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,992
Okay so here's how I got to

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
I have a

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
Former producer

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
A good friend Pat Walters

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh yeah yes

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,488
We responded and then he came to see me speaking summer

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,560
Yes and it was based on something he saw your talk about

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
Which is why I am now contacting interesting okay

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,008
Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab a story about a set of pictures

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Pictures

14
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,408
Set of questions about those pictures regarding who gets to see the pictures

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Who gets to decide who gets the ticket

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Do we get to see the pictures

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Well

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
Kind of a question

20
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,208
But I should say that there are some moments in the story that get a little

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
The word

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Heavy heavy

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
To be forewarned

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
But we'll start with the picture taker

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,424
My name is Lynsey addario and I'm a photojournalist

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Chicken covering War for the last 15 years

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
I've done military and beds

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,872
Infantry units patrolling going in house-to-house searches

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
She's worked in

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,760
Well everywhere Sudan Libya Lebanon Pakistani million places she's been kidnapped twice

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,136
You want to pull up ceramic Arthur and she's been called one of the most influential photographers of the past 25 years

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,744
In case this particular story that can you set it up a little bit

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Shorts

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
So in December of 2009 for Time Magazine

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Afghanistan

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Kashmir District

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
Helmand Province

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Station database

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
In the middle of the desert

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
I was

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,200
Embedded with the Medevac team and their role is to go in and pick up injured troops out of

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
The theater of war is a small team of basically helicopter Pilots Medics doctors basically whenever there's

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Winter Soldier

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
These teams are called whichever team is closest to the injured Kentucky like helicopter dropping into

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Yeah I mean this is fast

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,888
2 Lindsey had been embedded with this team for a couple of days

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
And not much will happen if you just sitting around reading magazines I've been re-reading the same magazines and one night

48
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,920
I think I was lying in bed and I was totally like if I wasn't asleep I was on the verge of sleep when they

49
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Someone ran was like

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
There's an alpha alpha is like

51
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Alpha means the most

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
Gravely wounded like you have seconds to get there I mean is it's life-or-death so she grabs two cameras her helmet body armor

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Runs Out to the Blackhawk I strap myself in and we take off

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
And I think it was about a 2-minute

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
Flight which is so fast

56
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
And I remember I was shooting the fields as we flew in because I was trying to focus and see

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
But I can see luckily they had lent me a set of night vision goggles which was really nice of the military

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Because you can't see anything without them in the middle of the night because they are using my fishing so they don't ever turn on the lights

59
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
Look see the camera directly you would see nothing just nothing so what you do for photographer do you put the night vision

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
Goggles in front of the camera lens so it looks green it's fluorescent cream

61
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
I mean the picture you get is green yes so they fly for two minutes to the pitch black land the helicopter she has no

62
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
No idea where everything is happening extremely fast I'm trying to focus as I'm looking out the helicopter.

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
And suddenly my viewfinder I see

64
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
A man

65
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Serve wrapped I think he was wrapped in a blanket and he's

66
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
He gets

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Courtright

68
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,400
In front of me on the floor of that of the Blackhawk

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
The first thing I thought

70
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Is I think he's already dead

71
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
He seemed completely unresponsive

72
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,480
And he seemed so young I just remember looking at his face and thinking

73
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
By what are we doing here

74
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
Within seconds there are born again flying back

75
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Field Hospital Lindsay takes pictures on that brief light back grainy fluorescent

76
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,047
Green images of the Medics 10 Soldier checking his vitals

77
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Wheel and

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
At the field Hospital in the hospital tent

79
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,383
The anesthesiologist everyone is there a carry him inside and put them immediately on the table

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Cut his clothes off their cutting his pants off open up his shirt and the room

81
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Start filling up

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
With everyone because everyone has heard that there's a

83
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
And so troops come in from across the base

84
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Children support

85
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
She says with a minister room went from the handful of people 5 6

86
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,655
Do a dozen 28 you can hear a pin drop

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
I'm in the room is

88
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
Silent except for the doctors

89
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
You know they're trying to resuscitate him he had lost I think eight or nine pints of blood they're bringing in blood

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Everything in all sorts of things

91
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
And I

92
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
Well yeah of course you know I'm basically trying to be invisible because it's so sensitive to be a photographer

93
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Current situation

94
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,607
What I do I don't shoot like thing I've ever I shoot

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
1 frame

96
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
And then I put my camera down

97
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
And I shoot another frame

98
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Cuz you can hear the click of the shutter

99
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
And it is like exponentially louder than normal in a situation like that

100
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
What did you get did anyone look give you a look

101
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,551
Back off at one point I was shooting for probably

102
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,183
I don't know five or six minutes maybe and an officer walked over to me

103
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
And he said

104
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Hey stop photograph

105
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,119
Yeah and I put the camera down and I looked at him and I said

106
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
I have permission

107
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
Kid worked all that out beforehand

108
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
What are the conditions over in bed at all these conversations you know what happens in the case of this what is my ass

109
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:14,271
Access what can I do but this one she says the room was full of people from across the base who didn't know any of that

110
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
Didn't know who she was but she had permission and so she was sort of at this fork in the road

111
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
There is always like that officer clearly felt with camera.

112
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Stop

113
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Obviously this is not the time to argue or to be disrespectful so I didn't say anything else I put the camera down but uses the moment she

114
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
She did that several other troop said no

115
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
Let her shoot this has to be documented interesting so you have one guy who says you can't take a picture of

116
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
Of this right almost like anything but this other guy is like no

117
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
This

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
Especially right right first of all the guy who said no was being protective it makes perfect sense for

119
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,071
But I think the guy to who stood up and said this has to be documented

120
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
I think it's some point everyone realize like look this war is not going away we are losing so

121
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
How many lives and Limbs and no one is seeing it

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
And keep in mind this is 2009 this is

123
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Just the tail end of a

124
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,759
18 year ban where the news media couldn't even photograph

125
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Military coffins

126
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,927
Andie Case the officer Let It Go Lindsey continue to take pictures for about another 20 minutes

127
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
She took pictures of the doctors cutting open the boy's chest massaging his heart at some point I remember someone one of the doctors

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,935
It looked up and said does anyone else have any suggestions basically 4 how to save him

129
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
And

130
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
Everyone said now and they should have disconnected the time he died

131
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,967
People were looking down and then they were looking at each other and

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
Someone went to go get a flag and American flag to drape over

133
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,415
First body I continued photographing and there was a moment where

134
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
The whole room was silent and people stood around

135
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
His body draped with a flag

136
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
And said a prayer

137
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
That to me

138
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,495
Is one of the most powerful images that came out of this whole series

139
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
There's an old idea in photography called the decisive moment

140
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
That

141
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:20,735
The world is filled with these far-off realities but every so often a photograph can capture a moment

142
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Takes you there

143
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
This is one of those photos

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
And the picture you see all these men and women standing in kind of a loose semicircle

145
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Some of them still have the blue surgical gloves on

146
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
They look totally spent

147
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
They're all looking in different directions

148
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
And they all look

149
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
You're not even there

150
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
I totally lost in their own thoughts

151
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Their attention is

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Clearly

153
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
In words

154
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Yeah I'm sure all those troops were like

155
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
Cod it. Could have been me

156
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Why couldn't we save him

157
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,295
What are we doing here in Afghanistan is this world worth it

158
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
And read the Expressions on their faces like it's even you can be at War as a journalist

159
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
Never actually get to the heart of the war because

160
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:09,119
We don't have access or people don't open up and I felt like I really had reached

161
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Like the

162
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Crocs in the war

163
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
State was war

164
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Using an essence

165
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
If something

166
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Attention problem

167
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,407
Any photos that she had taken that included that soldiers face

168
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
Or any other identifying marks like tattoos and he didn't have tattoos

169
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
According to the rules of her in bed

170
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,927
She couldn't use those photos without the soldiers permission you never got to speak to him

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
No

172
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
So was it

173
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Days later

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Weeks Later months later where you began to ask yourself can I eat it was minutes later

175
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,287
Military does not let journalists cover something like this without coming directly to that person and so

176
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Literally like I followed

177
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
The young man's body out to the morgue

178
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
And had to walk him outside

179
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
And I remember it was the moon was so bright that night and I was shooting with the Moonlight as he was B

180
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Carried outside

181
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,999
And then I went back to the tent where I was staying

182
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Within minutes of the military payo the Marines public affairs officers

183
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,031
He said you know you can't send those images out without permission from the next of kin

184
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
That's the rule for soldiers unconscious and then dies before giving permission I have to then go to the next of kin then I said

185
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
Set of course I understand you know I'm not doing anything with those photos in that moment I sign this piece of paper

186
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,183
When I give my word I keep that word you know but then the other side of me was like

187
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,071
F*** you know in Vietnam no one was signing pieces of paper and in Vietnam no one had to

188
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
To go to the next to Kin before they publish anything and that's why the American public I think

189
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,103
Rose up against the war in Vietnam because they saw them was graphic devastating images that were uncensored

190
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
So then what do you do in that situation room science I mean

191
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
I imagine you go to the next of kin right well you're not allowed as a journalist to reach out to the next if they asked me are you

192
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
Are you interested in being contacted by the next of kin if they're willing to speak to you so you can even know

193
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
I'll give you the information but I said you know of course I would like to be contacted by the next Canon please

194
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Pass my information on and

195
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
I was sort of just waiting

196
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
I'm at this point where you thinking the pictures that ever see the light of day

197
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
I had no idea

198
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
And

199
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Few days later

200
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Maybe you're less than a week

201
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
Her in bed was over she was flying to JFK on her way to meet her family for Christmas

202
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
And why voicemails on my telephone

203
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
And I listened that it was his father

204
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
Any left a voicemail and he said I understand

205
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
You were with my son

206
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
When he died

207
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
And I would like to talk to you and this is my phone number

208
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
I sort of choked up

209
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Just listening to his voice

210
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
Anticipating how difficult that phone call with me

211
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
That phone call

212
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039

213
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,623

I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

226
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:42,111
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting

227
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
And I request

228
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

229
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times

230
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
So did something

231
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

232
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,199
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

233
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

234
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,975
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

235
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

236
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,215
Don't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us

Gatime Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich Radiolab so lynsey addario photographer has these photo

242
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
He's intense photos of a soldier dying but you can't use them

243
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
Without getting permission from the next of kin

244
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Right

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
JS later I had voicemails on my telephone

246
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
And I listened and it was his father

247
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
Father's name is Todd Taylor

248
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Son's name is Jonathan Taylor

249
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,623
And just jump ahead for a second as we were talking about the phone call

250
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
And the Fallout from that phone call I had all of these questions about

251
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
What Todd Taylor was thinking at questions about a son things that Lindsay couldn't possibly answer so at a certain point you just tell

252
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
Tell me how to know I mean you could maybe interview on

253
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Do you think you would that mean

254
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007

00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543

Well I'd be happy to give you some I mean you can try

257
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,991
Lindsay put us in touch and I'll just about to visit for a second

258
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Todd Taylor was willing to talk

259
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Yeah two conditions one was like, do the story about these photos of us

260
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Astonish at least get to know his son a little bit

261
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,607
And the second was that I come down to Florida to meet him and his family personally

262
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Morning how are you

263
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199

266
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607

And then of course I'm Todd Taylor on Jonathan's dad

273
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
We're here to my house in Jacksonville Florida

274
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
And today is Jonathan's birthday it's April 8th

275
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
2015 so he would have been held today

276
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
28 years old today

277
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
28

278
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
When I got there they pulled out photo albums of Jonathan we all set at the kitchen table

279
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
And look at pictures

280
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Pictures of the baby that was

281
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Very young

282
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
Toddler this was on the Disney cruise

283
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
I took him on adolescent can you space center teenager semen in track invite cross country

284
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Going to prom that was Jonathan's girlfriend

285
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
Thing you notice immediately in all the pictures

286
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,935
And big blue eyes

287
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Really blue

288
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Boosted the brightness in Photoshop or something

289
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
Yeah that's I forgot I think we're on vacation here but

290
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
The class clown lot of goofy faces

291
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
If we knew how to make anybody laugh full of energy

292
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
Always into stuff

293
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Just to see what grades they had

294
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,567
If I had a crush should be like Oh no you're not going to have a crush no no boys there was one time before he left for Afghanistan

295
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,919
But I really sick with a fever and I remember him holding my hand

296
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
Just so you can make sure that was okay

297
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
And took care of me

298
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
They told me story after story about how he doted on his sisters

299
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,671
I would love to read and want to become a history teacher after his four years in the Marines

300
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,303
And inevitably the conversation turned to the day that they found out he died December 1st 2009

301
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
They got a call from Jonathan's mom

302
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
I'm saying

303
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
The classic scene

304
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Oh my God they're two marines at the door

305
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
And we just kind of like like left everything

306
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Zooted the girls jump in the car race over

307
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
Who made all the girls stay in the car

308
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,575
I remember walking in the door and everyone just had this look on their face like

309
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
The world

310
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
It just ended

311
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Dandong

312
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
I remember asking what happened

313
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
The first thing I did was run to his room because

314
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
Everything with the same before you left

315
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,087
Open having his closet

316
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
And I'm grabbing one of his shirts and just holding on to it because it still had it sitting on it

317
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
And I was really hard

318
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
One thing I never occurred to me

319
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
Totally caught me off guard in thinking about

320
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Those pictures

321
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Is that

322
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
When does Marines came to the door

323
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
And told them

324
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
The news

325
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Well they didn't actually give much news

326
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,343
This right here was one of this is what was red

327
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
Galaxy read me the circumstances of death statement

328
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
Hostile action result of multiple traumatic injuries received as a member of a dismounted patrol

329
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,959
That was struck by an ID while conducting combat operations in the Helmand Province

330
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
That was that on patrol night Patrol that's all I had

331
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
She didn't know anything

332
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
That's it

333
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
Jonathan's unit was still in Afghanistan so he

334
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,319
Couldn't talk to anyone he had no clue what happened to his son so when that casualty assistance officer

335
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Told him

336
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
I see there's a photographer in the room

337
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
With your son when he died

338
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
I'm a class like I wanted

339
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Want to color

340
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Earlier in my conversation with Lindsey I'd ask her

341
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
What do you remember the call

342
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
So the call

343
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
I went to my mother's house in Connecticut

344
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
And I asked my mother to be left alone which in a big Italian American family means

345
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,943
Look at me like what

346
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
What happened to the gas bedroom

347
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
And I called him

348
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
And he picked up

349
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
I think he thanked me for calling him

350
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't remember exactly what we said but I said

351
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
You know

352
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
I was with your son when he died

353
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,679
And I will give you as much or as little information as you want

354
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
And he said

355
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
I want to know everything

356
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
Because I wasn't there

357
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
I was here

358
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
He said I want to know every single thing I want to be with my son not be there for him.

359
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
That's notes hard

360
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Really hard

361
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
And I felt very awkward because I felt like

362
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
We know why was I privy to this moment and he is the father could not be perfect

363
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
Most important question me was

364
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
They suffered you think it is ever

365
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
I said

366
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,727
Now she told me Miss Taylor I don't I don't think you separate I think

367
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
He was in shock

368
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
I told him everything how much blood is Sun lost how long did they try to save him and at some point

369
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
I said look I have these pictures I have

370
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
All of these pictures I shot everything

371
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,879
And I need your permission to publish the ones that show his face

372
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Oh yeah

373
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
She asked me a proclamation and

374
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
He was quiet

375
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
I said

376
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
I told her yes

377
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
But that

378
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,704
He said II can I see them

379
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
I wanted to see him first

380
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
Before I give permission I want to see every photo

381
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,688
And I said you know I'm not sure you want to see these photos

382
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:44,064
Cuz they're graphic but he wanted to see the outfit he wanted to see every photo all of them

383
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,696
Course I we were on the phone I couldn't jump pictures and legally I needed

384
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,512
Permission from Time Magazine to show anything because

385
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
It was a journalist you can't show anything to anyone until it's published you don't show people pictures of

386
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Journalism before you publish them

387
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
This is one of those Cardinal rules it's drilled into every journalist said if you show a subject the raw stuff before it's out there

388
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
You kind of given up the only Independence you've got

389
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,272
That's why she says ordinarily I would never ever ever get out for a second if

390
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
He to be cynical about it if you show him the picture

391
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
He might take away permissions you might have otherwise give you exactly

392
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,072
Exactly you can say is a publication no I won't show those pictures before you have to just say yes or no

393
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
What do you give your permission

394
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,008
Like it anyway if you get down to it I feel like one of the fundamental layers here is just like a question of whose rights

395
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,104
Comes to that information is more important I could hear an argument that says

396
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,712
The battle is important it was authorized by public figures it is carrying

397
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
America's message into the world

398
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
And shouldn't Americans see what goes on

399
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,440
Yeah but I could hear an argument says shouldn't dad be able to protect who sees his son

400
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
Malaysian

401
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
Mini case Lindsay called redditors a time they had a series of conversations that went all the way up to the editor of time we had a

402
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:07,520
Very intense conversation and we collectively made a decision to show him the photos

403
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,616
To say that decision was unusual from their perspective

404
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Would be severely underweight

405
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
When I first got these

406
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
I'm from

407
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
FedEx

408
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
I know they were coming

409
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
And

410
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
I was actually

411
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Scared to look at

412
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
I saw my son there

413
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
I just kept looking

414
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
I don't mind looking

415
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
You can see

416
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,544
These were they in the Medevac when they got him on

417
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
You see the night vision lens there is Jonathan's body

418
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
I just there's a space thirsty ox

419
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Plus watch on still she is as close to her that was

420
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
So many hands not working

421
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
Consider doing CPR there

422
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
No

423
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Are you saying

424
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
Right leg is really

425
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Mangled

426
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
Unbroken

427
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
That's really why I lost so much blood it was just

428
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
All right in here some of these pictures that are really hard to see ya

429
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
But

430
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Leaving now

431
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
They show that messed up War

432
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
I got a piece of Jonathan

433
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
This is as my treasure

434
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Now she want the pictures that

435
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
To me it's

436
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
It always stands out

437
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
He brought up the picture of the prayer

438
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
All those people standing in a semicircle

439
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Far Away Eyes running

440
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
When you see a little different interfaces hair

441
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
I mean

442
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Hitman something

443
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
He was somebody

444
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
It wasn't just a number

445
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
Dad said you wanted people to see this picture

446
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
And the others to convey

447
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
What's

448
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Happy over there

449
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
This going on everyday

450
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
And he says for him it's not a political thing

451
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
You can feel however you want to feel about the wars were in

452
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
For him it's about

453
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
People seeing

454
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
What is actually happening when we don't want to

455
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
Let people say in the sacrifices they Boys Town

456
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,176
It took Todd and his family over a month to decide what to do about those pictures

457
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
Weather in Grant time permission to run the photos or not

458
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,600
He says ultimately he called Jonathan's mother over for her husband

459
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
And I'm

460
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
My wife and I

461
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
We all discussed it

462
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
And ultimately

463
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
She said no

464
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,680
And it was a lot of back-and-forth you said no to showing any pictures at all

465
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,288
Well he can't say no to any pictures because

466
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Exactly

467
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,640
He said no to any pictures with the face or identifying marks

468
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Wish I didn't really that

469
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Waiting on these pictures to get out

470
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Prepare that

471
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Is sisters

472
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
Tell me how to get back to them and

473
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
That was the big thing

474
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,208
Adam Anthony belsito shot as her dad I want to protect them

475
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
I'm saying something

476
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
So

477
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
We decided not to do it

478
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,008
Time had planned to run a whole photo spread on the Medevac team trying to save Jonathan Taylor's life

479
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
Since they now couldn't use most of those photos

480
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
They have to make a photo spread more general what had been the basically the death of a soldier ultimately became

481
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Photo essay on the Medevac team

482
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
And those pictures were maybe

483
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,464
Two pictures of three pictures in that spread but they were not the focus

484
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
Print photo is in the new Sprite because

485
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
In that photo

486
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
How you can't see the body

487
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,888
For the flag there no identifying marks

488
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
Somehow in that context

489
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
It's

490
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
It's not got the same in back

491
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Ridley

492
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
Because you see me after without the before it exactly and Todd showed me

493
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Original photo Sprite cuz I had sent that to you

494
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
You know again super on YouTube

495
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
This Is the End

496
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
This is the

497
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Future they wanted to do

498
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Yeah

499
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
See the pictures of someone's Montclair

500
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
This is

501
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Tumblr layout is going to be

502
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
29 minutes

503
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
Scrapping it out minute by minute

504
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
This whole process

505
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
So there you see all the before pictures

506
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Lead up to the

507
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:26,848
And what seems like if you don't see all that stuff though the wounds in the blood in the tenderness

508
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
As they tried to comfort him and then the emptiness they feel

509
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
When they couldn't save him

510
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
If you don't seal that

511
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
You're not really standing with him in that prayer at the end

512
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
You still seeing him across his face

513
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
The original spread

514
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
You are

515
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
There in that room

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
I did a they did a great job

517
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
You know

518
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Really powerful

519
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
And

520
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
I couldn't help but think that like

521
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Maybe

522
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,288
This would have created that conversation that Lindsey talked about

523
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
And how weird and I'm one of the only people

524
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
And to know that like I

525
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
The only reason I can describe it to you is come on the radio

526
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
You know I will always feel like

527
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Journalistically

528
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,512
We we sacrifice you know we did not tell the story as powerfully as we could have

529
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,400
But we had integrity and I feel like we treated everyone with respect and we kept our word

530
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
Lindsay and Todd now stay in touch

531
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Over email once or twice a year

532
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
And just keeping your word Todd has made a deal with his daughters that they can see the pictures when they turn 21 but interest

533
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
The three of them don't agree as to whether they want to

534
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Paige Mackenzie

535
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
You are about to turn 21

536
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Say they don't want to see the picture

537
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
I just couldn't handle it

538
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,560
Nothing for me I just don't want to see him in pain you know it's Mackenzie

539
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Amber him in one piece how he was I'm just

540
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
She's sensitive

541
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Bethpage

542
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Now Lauren the youngest for me

543
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
She said she needs to see this picture

544
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Because

545
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
I want to know what he went through and

546
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,408
I like constantly knowing things

547
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
And I don't like things being kept for me

548
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
I just want to

549
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
I guess I just want a visual

550
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,928
It sounds like she says she knows he's gone but she still somehow need to proof

551
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Not that it happened she knows it happen

552
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
It's so it feels real

553
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Okay so

554
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Big thanks to Pat Walters

555
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Kira Pollack

556
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Taylor family and of course lynsey addario

557
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
She has a book out now called it's what I do

558
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Which is sort of a memoir

559
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
About her War photography and how it changed her life

560
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
And that book is filled with

561
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Photography anything like the wind

562
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
We didn't see

563
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432
All this amazing pictures in there but nothing like

564
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
So yeah that's it

565
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,576
