Listening to Radiolab

Radio WNYC

00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,528
An upscale Mall in Nairobi has turned into a Battleground

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Armed men stormed Westgate Mall in the Kenyan capital

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
For lunchtime firing weapons and throwing grenade what appears to witness has to be at least a dozen gunmen

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,424
Have taken hostages inside others have reported that the

9
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
There have been reports there have been unsubstantiated reports Canyon police and

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Counter-terrorism officers are hoping I would feel like I need to start with the caveat that all these other stories that we

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
You know gotten to do together gunfire have been me telling you a story as a journalist

12
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,000
Feel like this story is going to be a story where I'm going to have to stop being a journalist

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,824
We got you just heard that was NPR's East Africa correspondent Greg Warner

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,896
Recently he came to us with another one

16
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
It was all about a struggle he was having

17
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,528
Trying to figure out how to tell a story

18
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,320
That is true

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
I'm sleep with that

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Sexy story about

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
The aftermath of an event that

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
Probably got more media coverage than almost any events in East Africa last year that is the

23
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
The terrorist attack on Westgate Mall in Nairobi

24
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
This was September 21st 2013 was a

25
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
Balmy Saturday afternoon Westgate Shopping Mall

26
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Crowded with more than a thousand shoppers

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
Even more families than usual were there that day because there was a children's cooking competition in fact the kids were just sitting up

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Dairy ingredients

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Parents just taking their seats when shortly after noon

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Gunman

31
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Entered the building shooting AK-47 is going Florida for killing people and the seats would last for four days

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
4 days

33
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Central Ein

34
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Like dozens of

35
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,224
International independent and local journalists are outside the mall

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Listening to sounds of gunfire

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Trying to guess

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,768
What's happening inside because the prices of course not allowed in while this for this battle is ongoing

39
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,328
Meanwhile I'm getting on the air every hour

40
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
Trying to piece things together

41
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Coming my way

42
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
So I'm going to

43
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Gregory movers you need to move Wyoming

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
But my point is that there was no information at the scene other than this gunfire

45
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
What there was were

46
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
A whole bunch of Survivor

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
How do you feel

48
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Helpless

49
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Help us a fact all the journalists were racing around interviewing eyewitnesses

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:22,240
Buddy was I'm in everybody was really running for their lives

51
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
Pocket dammit officials

52
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
To get a picture of what happened in the story

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,176
That emerges from the those interviews is basically.

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Stat

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
The number of terrorist inside that mall or at least in the beginning was 10 to 15 gunmen

56
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
And I'm 15 gunmen 10 to 15 attackers to 15 armed militants with her profile is multi-ethnic

57
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,144
Cancel the United Kingdom end

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Somalis

59
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Canyon aeroad

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Mostly men but also including a British woman that young British

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,736
Eyewitnesses eyewitnesses on different floors in the mall all talking about the Dare gun that the people they saw

62
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
And it's this multi-ethnic group

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
And then of course perhaps most alarmingly for the both of us living in Nairobi there's reports that at least one gun

64
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Had

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,071
After shooting some people thrown away his gun and actually escaped

66
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
With the fling Shoppers we hear that from a couple Witness

67
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
So that's the

68
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Initial story

69
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
But it's not really until 8 weeks later

70
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
In November

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
That us officials in fights

72
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
About

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Dozen

74
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
British and American journalist into a conference room in the US Embassy

75
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
And

76
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
We need an official there from the FBI

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:51,327
Now we've known that the FBI was involved in the post-mortem analysis

78
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Senora join

79
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Shazam

80
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
This is like a global terrorism event so

81
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
Can you head invited Scotland Yard and the FBI to figure out who these terrorists were but the FBI had not actual

82
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Said anything official

83
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,735
In this meeting inside the US Embassy what on what's called Deep background

84
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
Which isn't even off the Record it's it's a it's a deeper level of secrecy we weren't at that time even allowed to say that

85
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
The Us official had said any of this stuff this was just information for us to know

86
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,863
Since then I can talk about this meeting because everything that was repealed there has now become

87
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
A part of the public record in fact the FBI's

88
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Has come out publicly and said all these

89
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
But at the time this was new

90
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
End

91
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
What the FBI

92
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Person

93
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
Set the time was that his team

94
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,247
Had access to all the closed-circuit camera footage

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Is the mall

96
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
The modern moth there's cameras everywhere

97
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
He seen it from the beginning to the end of the attack from all those different perspectives

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
And according to that footage

99
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Everything

100
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
That we have reported

101
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
In those first few days

102
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Was Roth

103
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Ronnie running away

104
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Well friends in 10 to 15 terrorists

105
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
Now they weren't 1015 terrorist it were for

106
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,383
For they also said okay you've been reporting this

107
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,015
This multi-ethnic Coalition of Arabs Kenyans and somalis that so many eye witnesses told you know

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
They're all somalis are all Somali ethnicity all four of them

109
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
And there's also no evidence in any of the gunmen Escape

110
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
Mcqs from his perspective with words

111
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
He trying to

112
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
I don't know what we should read on this

113
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
And I actually felt

114
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
China weather

115
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
People in that room felt

116
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Huge

117
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Sense of relief

118
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,639
Because here we are all are trying to do the work of Journalism in a trying to get

119
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Credible testimony

120
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
And

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Suddenly here's a guy

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Saying

123
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,879
Okay take away all that speculation all those contradictory stories all those different reports

124
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Here's some objective evidence

125
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,279
You can't see this day because it's secret for very Saints terrorism reasons but

126
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
This is

127
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Solid

128
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,935
And after that time everybody was reporting the same thing

129
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Unreleased surveillance video shows

130
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Four armed assailants for terrorist

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,967
Text are believed to be from Somalia are all somalis will confirm

132
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
All four were killed

133
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
So you kind of put a cap on all those kids

134
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Scary theories

135
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Speculations that were really feeling the media the slightest bit curious about what might have been left out

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
No I mean

137
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
Well I guess I really felt was

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Was sort of empty

139
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Because

140
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
And I'm not only a reporter

141
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
In Nairobi

142
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm also a person living in Nairobi to go to dinner parties I take my kid to

143
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Birthday parties end

144
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,087
Special event in the first month after Westgate or so many

145
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,671
People in that mall invariably somebody would be there at the party you had

146
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Their own survivors

147
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
And it's one thing to say oh well

148
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
That was all this eyewitness testimony no it's not

149
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Accurate but it's another thing to look into the

150
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
The eyes of somebody

151
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Who is

152
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Sitting there

153
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
With a paper plate of cake

154
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
In their hand telling you that the terrorist

155
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
The base

156
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Is not the terrorist

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,575
They saw on this bit of footage that have been released and was playing and heavy rotation on Kenyan television

158
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,415
Is that happened more than once he was much more than what I mean

159
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Is your only your first name

160
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
They put my nickname former neighbor Vine in Nairobi

161
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
Saturday morning to the Westgate Mall to get

162
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Present for her friend's daughter

163
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,799
I think it was a puzzle a little puzzle for a 4 year old girl

164
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
And I'm standing that I'm just about to pay

165
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
And then automatic weapons

166
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Shooting the grenade tonight

167
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,303
Competition didn't have much time to think I just ducked under one of those tables and then

168
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
You could hear people praying muttering prayers

169
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
She said she had a man gasping for breath

170
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
And she says at one point

171
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,455
Another woman was under the table with her and I were literally squeezed together

172
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
She was pregnant

173
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
She was pregnant

174
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
And that's the first thing she said she's like

175
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,463
I'm pregnant and I'm shot I didn't have the presence of mind to help her she basically

176
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Took one of those grapes

177
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
And wrap it around

178
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
To stop the bleeding

179
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Later on I mean

180
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,263
Cuz we were there for quite some time she said to me I'm dying

181
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,175
And yeah that point of stroking her hair saying no you're not you're fine it's just your leg is just your leg

182
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
Increases that while she was under that table she would try to peek up through the cloth and for the longest time I couldn't see anything

183
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Finally I see

184
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
I see the guys

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
To those two young boys

186
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Cute little young innocent-looking boys

187
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:18,495
You know it's hard to imagine you can't reconcile what they're doing with how they look

188
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
One of them was was kind of I don't know maybe a 17 18 year old kid and cute

189
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
I could just

190
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,735
See him as being the son of one of my friends

191
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
This particular one was closest to us was wearing a red t-shirt

192
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
And here's where you get to a small but significant discrepancies

193
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Still haunts booty

194
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
She said she is sure

195
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
That the two guys she saw and pictures

196
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Few feet away from her

197
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Wearing short sleeve shirts

198
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
And afterwards

199
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Keep seeing these

200
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Images

201
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
4 guys

202
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
None of them were wearing shorts

203
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
We're at the beginning if you remember there was saying there was 15 guys so then it kind of made sense that well the two guys that I saw

204
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,015
What different from the floor that were seeing on TV

205
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
But then when people like me start to report that there were only four

206
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Categorically only for guys

207
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
Then I started to say wait wait a minute

208
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
I saw their arms

209
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
I know I saw a short

210
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Sleeve t-shirt

211
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
You know it just does not make sense nothing adds up

212
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Am I crazy

213
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
Is my mind playing tricks on me I think I saw one thing and then I didn't but I'm quite sure I saw this I mean

214
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
Everyday every moment of the day you're thinking about

215
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
What happened

216
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
What happened that day with these parties of your all these story

217
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Grace like ponies

218
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Is the word

219
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
The official narrative

220
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
And yet

221
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
It felt real

222
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
All the details seemed weird enough to be true

223
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Surreal enough

224
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
Picture of you know another person was talking about

225
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Yeah it's powerful story wear it with

226
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Man was shooting and then he got a phone call and

227
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Stop shooting long enough

228
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
To answer the phone

229
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
And then hang up and

230
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Start shooting again

231
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Music

232
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
You don't make details like that up

233
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
And this is what I think made things so awkward

234
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
At those conversations because they knew that the terrorists

235
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
They saw

236
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Was Jeff

237
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Then on the video

238
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
And

239
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
What that left them was

240
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Was two things one is that

241
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
That I might think that they were lying

242
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
End to that the

243
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Terrorist

244
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
That

245
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Haunts them is still out there

246
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
You know that guy could just be around

247
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
He could see me again

248
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
And here's where things get a little

249
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
Weird okay so this is 4 months later

250
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
Definitely the new cyclist kind of moved on as a journalist I don't really have to report I must get anymore it's Saturday afternoon again

251
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Like she just at home with my kids

252
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
And

253
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
I get a phone call

254
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
To call the

255
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Kind of offended the whole story for

256
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
And that's after the break

257
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
This is Darlene calling from Kampala Uganda

About what we're calling Brilliance basically I want to hear about this

Yo did something

267
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
That just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

268
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

269
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Or maybe the kid was a piano

270
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,103
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score

271
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,967
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

272
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
We're interested in the

273
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Epic moments where

Terror attack in Nairobi Kenya you just heard the beginning we're not going to tell you the end

283
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071

287
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
The story

288
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Bill becomes clear why

289
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
And evidently

290
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,063
Note 4 root

291
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
One of the first people I met in the parking lot on that first day of the attack

292
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Sunflower gunshots in outer space

293
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
Everybody was running away when I met him he was actually trying to reach his fiance

294
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
Still in there

295
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
She's not picking the phone

296
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Ivan Reitman the message how are you

297
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,015
Even I lost my specs he lost his eye glasses as he was fleeing

298
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
So let me see if you want me to come looking for

299
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Yangon to text

300
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Naruto messages

301
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
No reply

302
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Then I called her

303
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
No reply

304
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
What happened to Henderson

305
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
Wish you killed was later found among the bodies at the morgue

306
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
But then

307
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
A week later and it backup was for real

308
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
He told me something.

309
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
That he has not told me that morning

310
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Everybody was going to second floor

311
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Sister with this moment

312
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
In the mall

313
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Underpants

314
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
We're a bunch of people were running up the escalator

315
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
And one of the terrorists

316
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
Came down the opposite way

317
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
Down the escalator

318
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
What's pushing everybody down

319
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,375
Somehow he says he got spun around the opposite direction of the crowd

320
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
And then I saw him he gets a good look at this guy

321
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
I saw the person

322
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Very clearly

323
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
This person who was an Arab guy

324
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
He says he's sure but yes

325
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,735
And then he says that he ran and found a hiding spot and also something he pokes his head out

326
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
And he saw him again

327
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
When I saw this guy

328
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Houston Tennis Club

329
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
April 20

330
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
What do tomatoes grow

331
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Then he was wearing another clock inside

332
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
When do the clocks change

333
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Basically says that

334
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
After that

335
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
First party

336
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
The guy changed his clothes

337
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Dropped his gun

338
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
And then

339
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Insinuating himself

340
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
And when we came out this guy joined us

341
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
He joined us

342
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,015
So when I swim outside and I was telling everybody he's one of them it was one of them but everybody was in shock

343
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Nobody Cuda

344
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
See what I'm saying

345
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
NN do you know what happened to him

346
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
No I don't

347
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Midea

348
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Okay so

349
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Back to the phone call in January that I was telling you about

350
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
Farooqi calls me out of the blue

351
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,239
He says hey I'm sitting at a bar at a place called Diamond Plaza

352
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Which

353
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
Is interesting because Diamond Plaza happens to be one of

354
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
The perspective

355
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,711
Terrorist Targets in Nairobi a known terrorist Target besides West

356
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
And he says across from him

357
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Few tables away is V

358
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
Gunman the guy got away

359
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
I see him he's at the next table

360
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
And he says

361
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Can you come

362
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
And you actually what

363
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
First they told him

364
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Finish your beer and go home

365
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
I actually

366
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Hung up

367
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
Then I thought I probably shouldn't blow this guy off

368
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
If This Were happening in the United States I could have just said that the guy look if you're so sure about this why don't you just call nine one

369
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,439
But there is no 911 in in Kenya and so he called me

370
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,303
And I basically said to him a woody would you want me to do and he said just let the police know

371
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
And then I did I'd I called the source that I know in the police department and he called his people and they did

372
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
We're going to be right there where is this location

373
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
You know they treated it seriously so

374
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
Once there was this amazing possibility

375
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
I feel like I'm going to wait downstairs until the police show up and then you know cops style I'm going to rain

376
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Race up with them and sort of

377
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
Be behind the police so I'll be able to witness it but I'll be safe but I get there in the police are like

378
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Not there yet

379
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
So I'm waiting downstairs bar

380
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Hertz calling me like where are you man and I said well I'm downstairs I'll keep come up

381
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
I don't think this is a good idea

382
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
As I'm sitting there arguing with

383
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
We have to hurry because

384
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,167
I've invited this guy this was supposed terrorist to sit with me at my table

385
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
What

386
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Golden City

387
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah I guess the guy was about to leave and fruit in monthly if so

388
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,247
He jumped up and somehow convinced this guy

389
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Stranger

390
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Did Fitbit have a drink with him at the table

391
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
I think it's going to

392
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,871
Come up I walk into the bar

393
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
Far past the pool table

394
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,759
Out outdoor bars will you bring to the table and indict

395
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,903
Yeah yeah yeah there's this guy late 20s

396
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Fairly slender

397
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
He was wearing a t-shirt black jeans

398
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,839
I detail it stood out to me was that he was wearing two watches

399
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Really

400
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
So sit down order beer

401
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Makeup

402
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,383
Terribly lame story that why I'm there

403
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Phone case from my wife.

404
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,295
We'll talk to the guy didn't speak English

405
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
Joey

406
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
This kind of conversation you didn't really understand

407
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
What I say except for very basic stuff

408
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
But within a few minutes my sitting down the police finally arrived

409
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:42,016
Brooke jumps up IDs the guy who is completely confused but what's going on

410
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
He was at the mall the day of the attack

411
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
And so the police

412
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,536
The question again

413
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
It is very suspicious

414
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
They asked him where he's promises Nairobi

415
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,984
Even though he had told us that he's from Yemen and then

416
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
They asking for passport and then he says oh I don't have my passport but then he does and then he says I want from Yemen so

417
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,992
Anyway so that's enough for the police that they put the rubber handcuffs on him and they take him away

418
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
He didn't say he seemed kind of belt

419
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
You seem high actually

420
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
Coming ahead and mention with it

421
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
The guy Ben

422
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Shooting

423
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Narcotic leaf

424
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
It's called Mira

425
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Cot

426
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
And so

427
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
He

428
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
He seemed no

429
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Like a scared High person

430
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
You know where you're scared but you're kind of numb

431
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Do whatever

432
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,616
Everything is happening all seems like a dream

433
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
What was not

434
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,224
Conjectural with it as the police were leading him out

435
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Farooq

436
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Just

437
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Lose it

438
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,584
White guy you know

439
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,984
Anyone anyone at the bar.

440
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,432
You still want all we could do to kind of calm him down

441
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,808
You know my family saying

442
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,160
Looking at life in prison I love my life

443
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
I saw him and he was watching me

444
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
You showed my love man

445
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
How can I

446
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Let It Go

447
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
This is the day

448
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
Under 10%

449
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
That's when the call to prayer comes out of the speakers from a nearby mosque

450
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,184
All the way through it

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
Directly from the bar to go to the police station to give a statement

452
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
And I

453
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
I felt really bad

454
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Actually

455
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
I never felt like I was doing something

456
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Wrong per se

457
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
But I felt that

458
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Had come

459
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
To this person

460
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
And actually

461
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,480
At that point I didn't feel that he was a terrorist and I just hope

462
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,784
That the system

463
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
To which I had helped commit him

464
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Would treat him fairly

465
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
After that I kept calling the police station

466
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
Every few days about 10 days later I found out

467
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
The guy was released

468
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,008
And he hadn't been charged with anything and it's that point I was like

469
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Alright Grace

470
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Is all worked out fine

471
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,200
Poor guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time and you know got falsely ID possibly but

472
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
Book everything is done everything kind of worked out the way it was supposed

473
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
And that's what I sent you know for 4 months basic

474
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
Went off to do other kinds of reporting other stories

475
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
But a few months later

476
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
I was talking to a police Source again

477
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,168
And I happen to mention we're taking a different story said yeah whatever happened to that

478
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Black guy from

479
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
Yemen that fellow it was picked up at Diamond Plaza and he said only knows funny that the witness that you told us about

480
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
You never showed up

481
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,040
Didn't show up

482
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,672
I said what fruit never showed up to give his testimony you can hear from the tape

483
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,768
The one thing that's so clear

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
He said he's on his way over to police station full barrels blazing and so I called

485
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Farooq

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Annies phone is off

487
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
And then

488
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
I called his phone still off

489
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
A few minutes late

490
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
This phone number is no longer in service kind of thing

491
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,576
So it's actually not until close to the year anniversary

492
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,136
Of the Westgate that I get a call

493
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Your number

494
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Another word for weak

495
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
And it's

496
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Fruit candy

497
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,472
Very nervous he says are you alone

498
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Asking me

499
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Not to record this

500
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
Conversation natale's me

501
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,384
He had gone to the police station just as likes

502
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Suspected he marched right over to the police station

503
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,760
And they told him I will know this is being handled by the X terrorism police

504
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
So

505
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
You leave your phone number and then it's terrorism police will give you a call

506
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
A week later

507
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,024
He started getting calls several calls from unknown numbers

508
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
Where people who did not identify themselves

509
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Threatened

510
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
Told him not to say anything

511
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
About this guy he had arrest

512
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
Not to talk to the Press

513
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Or

514
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
He be sorry and his family would be

515
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Sorry

516
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,016
He was extremely rattled by these phone calls and ultimately

517
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
She turned off

518
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
This phone if I couldn't get a hold of him

519
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
Left the country

520
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
4 short bed

521
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
It come back

522
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
Was laying very low and it's

523
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
Why I'm using an assumed

524
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Name Prim when I'm not telling you

525
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Full name

526
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Doesn't want that

527
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
And you believe the stories about

528
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Threats and

529
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,288
Absolutely no way of knowing for sure

530
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
That

531
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
Part of his story though

532
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Seemed

533
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,456
The most likely to be true

534
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,272
The fact that the anti-terrorism police

535
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Had called him

536
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Allegedly and made threats

537
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
That does not sound strange

538
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,048
And fortunately to me I've heard that story from lots of very credible people does this make what he saw.

539
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Drawer

540
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Country where we go I don't know

541
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,936
Suddenly I found myself less willing to discount the story

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
And

543
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
I was less comfortable with the

544
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Official narrative

545
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Then

546
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
I wanted to be at that

547
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
So

548
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
I called up

549
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
One more

550
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
Guy a guy who is not a government official

551
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Who's not the FBI

552
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
And yes quit

553
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
Seen all the videotape

554
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,696
From the mall can you just give me your name and your

555
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
And your title and read I'm a producer and director of documentaries most recently Terror the mole which was

556
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Tonight's HBO and the BBC

557
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
And for that documentary Dan got

558
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Exclusive access to

559
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
All the surveillance footage

560
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Inside that mall

561
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
If there were more to this

562
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Story

563
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
You can tell me so how much footage

564
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,576
Did you get if I can ask him and how many hours are the footage we obtained added up to about

565
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,952
Mom $2,000 while when we analyze the timeline where the cameras weren't we

566
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,304
The offsets between different cameras we really did a huge forensic job

567
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
It's mind-numbingly tedious to watch a lot of it

568
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
But if you

569
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
Dugite writ you do get the key to another the mysteries of Westgate

570
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
Like me you got into this project

571
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
Open mindedness very kind of

572
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Eunice OBO

573
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,480
Sensible people who said the other was 7 Paris

574
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
I saw 7 Terrace

575
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
I mean you dream of

576
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
Be able to confirm that they were seven government you dream of being able to confirm that they will escape what if that were true what if

577
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
If we could

578
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Find

579
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
Evidence some evidence that that were true

580
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
But in the end

581
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
He didn't know as well as we

582
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
Progressed further and further with our

583
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,848
Forensic analysis it became harder and harder to give any credit to some of the wild two pieces of

584
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Have eyewitness

585
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,968
He says what you see on those tapes is what the FBI said you'd say

586
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
4 guys

587
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
All Somali

588
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Xi an

589
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
Exactly was in how does he

590
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
Square of the stories

591
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
You were hearing with the stories

592
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
You are reporting

593
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Well that part was actually fighting

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,632
We are little people say yeah there was a woman

595
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
When I was going through this footage my wife looked over my shoulder

596
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,800
Pointed to one of the four terrorists on the screen that won't push it or is that it go

597
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
And we came to the conclusion that that one of the gunmen was in a very slender and he actually does sachet alone in in

598
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,808
What is Frankie quite an effeminate way and similarly he says you can

599
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:21,184
Justify some of the reports that one of the gunmen was an Arab because one of them did in fact have

600
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Lighter skin

601
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Then your average Somali

602
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
And you can explain the people thought that they were

603
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,376
More gunmen 10 or 15 gunmen because they were a lot of guys

604
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Two guns running around

605
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Pudding

606
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Security guards

607
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
And later

608
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
Policeman there were a lot more policemen than they were gunman

609
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,592
I did speak with one eye witness

610
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
Who said it it that he saw one of the terrorists

611
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
She may change clothes and Escape

612
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,600
Well I know that doesn't that doesn't match anything that we saw

613
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,976
I didn't think the question to ask your eyewitnesses is is how do you know this person with a weapon who changed codes

614
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Was a terrorist

615
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
It may have been a policeman recently had

616
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
Stories of policemen taking off

617
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,728
Changing clothes will take note of any any distinctive clothing I don't know if those stories were true but we we had stories

618
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
Uniformed policeman

619
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,944
Took off their uniform even more fight I guess yeah I mean that but that's feel Greg. Fuel I mean

620
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,600
Speculation and did not see that on the any of the securities

621
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,952
I just had so many conversations like people sing to me know their skates and I'm like why do you think that

622
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,536
You know these guys don't come to escape if you escape you failed

623
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,120
He says take the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai

624
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,960
They had murdered 35 people at the hotel

625
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,520
There's a moment in that film where one of the gunmen

626
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
One of the last remaining gunman in hotel room next to use in the bathtub next to

627
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
Is his accommodate his dad is dying

628
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
He's talking to one of his handlers on the cell phone

629
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,976
Recording that call ended

630
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
The handlers free call me Satan you know you what your mission

631
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Successful to you or kill

632
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,752
And then they say to him

633
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,104
Please leave your phone on switch on the line open in your pocket

634
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,944
So that we can hear when you go out and I'll killed by the

635
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Enemy security Force

636
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
So there is a whole script

637
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,816
So this kind of operation and it ends with the death

638
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
All of the gunmen at the hands of the enemy

639
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Ma

640
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
That's how

641
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
He knows they didn't Escape

642
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
Not just because there's no evidence on the film but because

643
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
It's the last thing they would have wanted

644
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
And yet we don't need these

645
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,856
The rumors that the Terrace Escape the Room is that there was a woman amongst in the room is that they got change the room is

646
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,464
They don't seem to go away even when confronted by quite solid evidence

647
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
It's almost

648
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
Is it the Faxton Masa

649
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
So I called Farooq

650
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
Still sticking to his story

651
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,520
He says he saw a saw though

652
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
He's really

653
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Too nervous to go on tape

654
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
But I did run it by puni

655
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
My former

656
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Neighbor in Nairobi who's

657
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
100%

658
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,016
Still pretty sure that the guy she saw in the mall

659
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Hasn't been accounted for

660
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
I think I'm sure about it but

661
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
What is the government said

662
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,840
Here's the bodies here the DNA evidence here's the four they'd all die they died on the second day

663
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
Or third day whatever was this is how they died and here's the DNA proof

664
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
Really make me happy is if

665
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
They even asked the questions

666
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
Beat the media beat the government

667
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Why did we go from 15

668
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
To 4

669
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,624
Quickly tell you how we arrived at 4 cuz I told her about the meeting with the FBI

670
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,208
And how we got this information then I told her about

671
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,024
Dan Reed watching 2000 hours of video tape

672
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
I told her about how I investigated Farooq story and

673
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
Mostly came up empty I told her not to

674
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,216
Everything that I know all these facts but

675
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
How I got to

676
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Because

677
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
In the end

678
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
Maybe the facts Aren't Enough

679
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Fax need to make sense

680
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
Especially for people who

681
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,576
But I can imagine for anybody was not there anybody was reading it yet the evidence says and then you move on

682
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,208
Listen to I feel like I'm I'm learning much more about my job and

683
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
Being a journalist and maybe it's not so pretty because I feel like that

684
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
That day coming out of that meeting with the FBI and feeling like okay now we

685
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,640
We have some solid evidence that can be reported and we can move on felt

686
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Good I mean it felt like

687
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
Offering instead of offering shaky as a testimony we could offer Truth at least his

688
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
Best we can understand it but it feels like maybe that was too sudden and too

689
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
Due to an inquisitive in a way to match the emotions that we're still

690
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
In the air in the rub it that time maybe it felt like abandonment even though it was meant to feel like clarity

691
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Xiaomi

692
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
It's still there's a little

693
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
Glimmer of maybe that's not

694
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
The full story

695
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
I am inclined to believe

696
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
That they were four

697
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,112
But then it's like what I saw does not make sense

698
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,464
And that I'll never be able to really reconcile and I just kind of have

699
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Leave it at that

700
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
Lot of people think for the story of course Greg Warner

701
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
