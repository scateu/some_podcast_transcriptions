1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Are you weightless

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,872
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,944
And NPR

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,784
Davis Jad abumrad this is Radiolab the podcast Robert

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Is out of town today he's actually

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
His son is getting married so it's just me

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
I thought in this podcast

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
I want a little bit

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
Generally and that should be in front of your mouth start with a conversation

10
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,592
That the Brooke Gladstone and I said Brooke from on the media

11
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
She and I had with my brother-in-law

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
Ugim Eugene Thacker I'm an author and professor at the new school in New York City

13
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
Very weird thing that happened to Eugene

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
Felt like a kind of story I've been wearing black since I was 13

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
Two-tone black right now set it up

16
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Eugene is a hard

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
Quartz color of philosophy

18
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
And he writes his books

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,104
Let them be little use words like

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
Exegesis

21
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
And ratiocination

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
Until the family joke

23
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Is that

24
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
He writes books

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
For now on I think the a joke started out I write books that nobody reads and then

26
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,048
After a slow long. Of acceptance I started to think well maybe I should write books

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
I'm for no one to read to just started embrace.

28
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Meeting at a certain point if you do this kind of work you're going to have to ask yourself if you knew that this would not be published would you still write it

29
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
How committed are you

30
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,872
And he decided he was committed he would write it no matter what

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
So the Story begins couple years ago 2011 Eugene writes this book called in the dust of this planet

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
In the dust of this planet

33
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:05,696
It's kind of a hard book to describe but if you had to sum it up in a sentence it's about the end of the world

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,024
But not in the Hollywood

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Sense darker than that your hypothesis is the greatest horror

36
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Is that

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Nothing exists and nothing matters and the world that we live in that weed

38
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Define in terms of humanity doesn't care about us is often referred to

39
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
To his nihilism or pessimism that there might not be a purpose to things or to your life or to our

40
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
Distance or to the cosmos there might not be in order

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
The things we might not be here for a reason this all might be purely arbitrary in an accident that there's no inherent meaning

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
Anything but it just doesn't matter is what Nietzsche called most difficult thought

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
And in the book Eugene traces this idea through all of these different horror movies

44
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
He's from slasher films to sort of more supernatural horror music

45
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,928
One point he goes into the sea construction of how different types of black metal deal with a thought I don't know it's

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,560
It's something it's other way of thinking I've always found really intriguing and ironically kind of

47
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
Inspiring are you a pessimist

48
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
All my better days

49
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Are you a nihilist

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
Not as much as I should be

51
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
Okay so Eugene writes this book in 2011 it is dark

52
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,736
It is dense he writes it at his house for no one and as expected

53
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Beyond a few philosophy types

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
No one really pays attention

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,464
So keep your head down teaching writing but then

56
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Something's Happened 2014

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
It's all one ghetto man giant gutter in outer space

58
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
The show True Detective comes along comes a big head and at the center of the show is this character Russ

59
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
Nicole is Louisiana detective who is one dark dude human consciousness

60
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
Tragic misstep in evolution these rant about how there's no order in the world how humans are just as accident

61
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
You was at a god consider myself very last time but in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist

62
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
And I just remember watching it and being like wow

63
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Sugs wife Priya Murthy my sister-in-law has so many conversations that we've had

64
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
Add in the car she's like where they listening in on us Dairy soprema goes online fix around

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Then I see this article

66
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
About the True Detective

67
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
The director was an article where I actually the writer of the show Nic pizzolatto was asked how did you create that character

68
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Wireless police detector

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,447
And he lists a bunch of things he was reading at the time in that list was

70
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Eugene

71
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Which I was like

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Cool

73
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
At least one person but I really just try to

74
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
Keep my head to the ground and just keep riding just doing what I'm doing

75
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
But then

76
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,903
Things got weird okay so now he has pull up the

77
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
The Lucky Magazine the secret behind it

78
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,839
Short time later Prima is flipping through this fashion magazine Lucky Magazine and there was

79
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
A spread with this actress Lily Collins 25 year old actress I never heard of pretty big right now she's standing on a

80
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Any street corner

81
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
Dressed up in all of this sort of God

82
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,687
Makeup and clothing and in the photo she is

83
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
Where is Eugene's Buck on her chest

84
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
She had on and one of the shots

85
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Sweatshirt

86
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
That have the cover of the book

87
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
In the dust of this planet big letters

88
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,511
Right on her chest and I was just like no way it was definitely

89
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
What The Hell she's just casually wearing my husband's

90
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
Book cover I don't know I can't I didn't

91
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,567
React to but it was just strange to that a Norwegian artist had made a painting of the book

92
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,175
That eventually gotten picked up by a fashion label and turned into some very expensive clothes

93
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Yep

94
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,319
I write books for now under himself obviously I'm not pulling in a lot of royalties

95
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,415
Honest but you know Eugene says he's not going to sue I'm not

96
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Going to see or take any legal action

97
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
I really do anything about it

98
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Cuz he says that's not why you right

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Okay so that happened

100
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Banana gets weirder still

101
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,407
My wife Karla Murthy is online this is the day that Jay-Z and Beyonce announce they're going to do the

102
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Big International

103
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
Carlos watching the video that they released

104
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Fake movie trailers guns fire

105
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
Hookers

106
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Bonnie and Clyde thing

107
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Ranking the running from someone you not quite sure who fiance is in a wedding dress and that Avail on

108
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
But she's shooting semi-automatic weapons in wedding dress cut the car chases cut the money flying everywhere but at

109
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
Exactly 37 seconds in

110
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,927
You see Jay Z turn stick a giant gun out to his right

111
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,559
And he is wearing Eugene's book

112
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
Right there on his back in the dust of this planet

113
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,823
What is the point of which I was like

114
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Okay what do we make

115
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
Could it be that Eugene is no longer writing books for knowing that somehow he is become a conduit

116
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
With this idea that we all

117
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,695
In that Subterranean way that pop music operates that we all are channeling right now

118
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
That was my

119
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
Yeah and I think that's

120
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
That's the question

121
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
Is whether this is something particular

122
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
To the moment we're living in and Eugene

123
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
His knee-jerk reaction is

124
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
I think it could have been this cover or a million other covers

125
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
No

126
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,223
This is just meaningless appropriation I don't think there's anything more than that

127
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
To me then it's just the looks like a cool phrase to go on a t-shirt to put on a goth girl and Son photoshoot

128
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
And why is it

129
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
The cool

130
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Right

131
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
Cuz my heart

132
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,839
Is you might be right but you also might be wrong because of the answer that you're about to give to Brooks Quest

133
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
It's cool because some publicist this was her the conversation one to have and swipe

134
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,847
Brooke like what is behind all of this nihilistic entertainment this everywhere

135
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,943
No Brooke for her part agree that Eugene probably is tapping into

136
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Yes

137
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
But is this unique to this moment

138
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
And to that I would say no really

139
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
You don't think this says anything about now I think there are Cycles

140
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
In which

141
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
The sense of meaninglessness

142
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
Comes out in sharper relief

143
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Then other time

144
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,471
But you can identify them over and over again

145
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Nihilism

146
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
All the way back

147
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
Brooke actually turned it down to this guy

148
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,247
Simon critchley in the Hans Jonas professor of the new school for social research

149
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
Simon wrote an article that basically made the argument that nihilism is the basic Credo of cool is it

150
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
It's sexy it's interesting been that way forever

151
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
Echo echo echo the best thing for your love this

152
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
It's a Russian witch right he said the word really got its pop in 1862 this is 150 years ago

153
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Does a novel by

154
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
Turgenev Fathers and Sons

155
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
And in the novel The Sun whose nihilist turns to his conservative dad

156
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
He says we pay Stockholm. Recognizes useful

157
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
In these days the most useful thing we can do is to repudiate

158
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
And so we repudiate

159
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Everything

160
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
The fall this is everything

161
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
Everything with indescribable

162
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Composure

163
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Everything

164
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Jokes

165
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
Simon Says roughly from that point on you see young people

166
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
Glom onto this idea again and again as a way to

167
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
You say no to the older generation or two just what's happening in the world for example after World War 1

168
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,319
Tens of millions of people dead this Lost Generation it was confused and disgusted what just happened

169
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
None of that says Brook you get Dada I want to

170
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Pull up here on the computer

171
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
The manifesto of

172
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Tristan tzara

173
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
He was one of the founders of the Dada movement he says Dada means nothing everything one

174
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
One look that is false

175
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Dada abolition of memory Dada abolition of archaeology dada

176
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
Abolition of prophets Dada abolition of the future and after World War II

177
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
Can Simon say you had similar movements

178
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
In the seventies and eighties with the threat of nuclear Annihilation you get punk rock

179
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Just keeps going pop culture at least since

180
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
I was a kid has always been deep in Odyssey

181
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Alright it's nothing new

182
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,495
But when I ran Simon through the Eugene jacket situation then I asked him like

183
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
Is there something different about today's nihilism vs. nihilism of the past

184
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Play something more potent about it

185
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Without hesitation

186
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
He said

187
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
I say I say yes

188
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Based on what

189
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,951
That's pretty sure any Mills who was with me during the interview

190
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
I know you can do you can get

191
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Simon says it was more of a gut feeling

192
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Based on this class that he taught last year

193
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
With Eugene I didn't actually know they knew each other but they have taught this class together so the seminar the wages in the

194
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
You foolish it was one of those

195
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,431
Resume. Switching mysticism nobody teaches mysticism

196
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,783
Pretty obscure stuff within desert fathers medieval female Mystics

197
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
This is early Christianity a religious

198
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
He says they started the seminar

199
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Not really expecting much

200
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,255
By talking about how in the 4th Century ad

201
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Where was the city Alexandria

202
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
Egypt Alexandria was a low-light Manhattan

203
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
It was an offshore Islands

204
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Biblical name of a

205
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,567
Former Pala Roman Empire cultural learning in the ancient world

206
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
A certain point in the full century

207
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
People start to leave

208
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
They tell to leave and go into the desert

209
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
People wander off

210
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
And they seem to want something else

211
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
The sissy doesn't just doesn't do anymore

212
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
It's corrupt

213
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
It's broken it's it's sinful

214
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,631
He said crime is rampant pollution and so people just started to wander off into the desert

215
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
Live in these caves and vision tense forms of assessment practice became like he had these women who were

216
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
No education cuz when they couldn't be educated

217
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Who is so

218
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
Enraptured with Christ they began hosting themselves throwing themselves into icy Rivers jumping into ovens

219
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
The body is something which is

220
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
You're trying to strip away

221
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
In order that you can free the capacity for love

222
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,047
I got a classic Mystic idea right the body is just getting in the way of

223
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
I want to go soul2soul exactly with God exactly for the premise of the again is the the world is a country

224
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
Field of ruin

225
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
He says what really struck him is it

226
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
As he was talking about all this he would

227
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Glanced out at the student

228
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
And he would notice this

229
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Look in there

230
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
I just felt in the room there was this

231
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
This deep need was being fulfilled by these

232
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Strange Mystics

233
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
He said the students

234
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
In any way that almost never happens when your

235
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,583
We want no saving Souls but it was it was hitting something really really deep

236
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
What exactly I mean do you think they were starting

237
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Deform the thought of

238
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,335
Wandering into the desert so to speak

239
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,175
Secede walk away you know that's where a lot of people right

240
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
As for what's behind it all

241
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
He says just turn on the news video showing the beheading of a second American journalist has now been verified

242
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
Davis is turning into one of those longest deadliest outbreaks ever girls were gotten raped and strangled

243
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,887
Photography nearby

244
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Since it was

245
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Completely

246
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
Crazy mutually assured destruction but it makes sense and you can understand and principal terms that was United States was

247
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,711
Soviet Union food going to be a Vista races that was clear but it in a you knew what the balance of powers

248
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,343
You're near a nostalgic for mutually assured destruction is that what's happening now seems a much simpler

249
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
You at least knew who to blame for it right

250
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,487
Atlanta again look at the Cold War

251
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
And you could see like pacifically like you Soviets the Americans the nukes

252
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,543
That's right that's right now

253
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Carbon emission

254
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Speaking of which today the world's leading climate scientists warn it will get worse no doubt one of the reasons for the current

255
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
Gloom is that we are in the middle of an uncomfortable shift

256
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
And how we talk about climate change in the ipcc

257
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
The intergovernmental panel on climate change released a report

258
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
We're for the first time they stopped

259
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Using the language of prevention

260
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
And shifted to the language of adaptation in other words

261
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Hundreds of scientists and policymakers

262
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
What's the world's top Organization for assessing climate change

263
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
We're now saying

264
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
We Can't Stop

265
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
It's inevitable

266
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
So now we need to talk about dealing with the mask that is now on our doorstep that's David Victor professor of international relations

267
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
University of California at San Diego

268
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
And he is one of the authors of

269
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:01,791
When the ipcc first began back in the late 1980s you could imagine

270
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
The people would take the climate change problem seriously

271
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,215
They would start to control emissions and then over a. Of decades climate

272
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Would stop changing and it said what's happened is people have talked a lot about climate change but they haven't actually done much to catch

273
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,735
Emissions now he says we're all in this strange Middle Ground where we're trying to find the language

274
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
To say why it's important to keep working at this while at the same time

275
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,719
Admitting some degree of failure and that's the kind of inevitability that I think you see in the new

276
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,327
The new reports in any reports are bending over backwards to try and find ways

277
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
To be optimistic the report says

278
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
If you put into place all these Technologies and international agreements we could we could still stop warming at 2 degrees

279
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
My own assessment is that

280
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
The kinds of actions you need to do that are so heroic that

281
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
We're not going to see them

282
00:16:54,015 --> 00:17:00,159
All of which reminded me of that True Detective moment I consider myself for real

283
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
Some what's called a pessimist okay what's that mean well pessimists like nihilist agreed

284
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
There's no meaning they're just a little more mopey about it less likely to do something means I'm bad at parties

285
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
Means that we're all headed you know in a recent Wall Street Journal

286
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
Poll 76% of people 18 and over

287
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
Weren't confident that the future is going to be brighter than the past

288
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Which brings me back to Brooks question why is it cool

289
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
Collet nihilism pessimism whatever shouldn't be depressing

290
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:37,023
Why would you want to put a phrase like in the dust of this planet afraid deliberately negates the person wearing it why would you want to

291
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
I put it on your

292
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Chester on your back

293
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,679
Encourage it

294
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
I have been here

295
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287

In the modern world more information about Sloane at www.

302
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031

00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

305
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about

306
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Kid you know did something

307
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can

308
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

309
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin

310
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework were interested in the

311
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it

312
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,511
If you have a story please share it with us

313
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,887
Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us

Isis Jazz Radiolab so

317
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
We ended up in the flow of things you know as we're trying to figure out like in the dust of this planet

318
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Why is that cool why is that just scary

319
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Depressing

320
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
I want to talk to me why

321
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Talking to this way

322
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,007
Who turns out was the person who made the decision to put it on Jay-Z's back

323
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
I should say my name I guess

324
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
My name is June Ambrose

325
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
I've been a costume designer for 22 years

326
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
23 this year in network with everyone from

327
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,319
Luther Vandross too puffy to xian

328
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
Mariah Carey Busta Rhymes Mary J Blige Alicia Keys

329
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
Dave Matthews Band The Backstreet Boys Kelly Ripa cancel trial R Kelly

330
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
Jamie Foxx Missy Elliott

331
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Did you do the Missy with a balloon

332
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
That was you know my God

333
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Of course

334
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
Jay-Z and Beyonce that's like culture basically

335
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,695
Nazi stuff it occurred to Andy and I during the interview that June has

336
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:51,071
Probably influence the fashion sense of a significant portion of the human beings on this

337
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
Planet and she was very clear that a costume

338
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
It's more than just a cost

339
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
It's like a conversation

340
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
Without words

341
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
What she's doing what she sows someone is

342
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
Bring me to all the people that are going to watch the videos come in contact with the Billboards go to the concerts

343
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
I don't have to talk to you

344
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
But I can create this conversation

345
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,696
With a pair of pants and how they fall and how they fit in the texture in the color in the feeling

346
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
He says with Jay-Z for that video

347
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
She knew she needed something Epic

348
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
But like Australis I knew I wanted to biker jacket it was a motorcycle scene but I knew that I just couldn't give up The Lacs

349
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,312
I need it I need it to say something feel like something

350
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
We're on the hunt

351
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Her nurse assistant went to doesn't the place of cilia Studio the showroom looking at all these leather jackets it's like finding a needle in the hay

352
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
Nothing was right then the soundtrack to This one place black denim this place it does for high-end grunge.

353
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
They're flipping through the racks when she sees the jacket those were

354
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Words and that was it I knew it

355
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
I said I need this is what I need

356
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
It just felt it was just

357
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Perfect

358
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Questions why

359
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,456
This one I hadn't really told her the whole back story so I pulled out a screen capture from the video is one where you see Jay Z

360
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
Standing in the desert shot from behind in the dust of this planet on his back

361
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
Really long Dirty Harry gun off to his right sode up

362
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
About to shoot the sun you think he's about to shoot

363
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,816
I printed it out cuz it's just got this like

364
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,472
Billboard quality to it right have a really cool one of my phone to this nevermind okay so we'll just look at it

365
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,336
And why did you choose that jacket

366
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
You know something very menacing about it

367
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
It's almost like

368
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,160
The aftermath that there was something going on it was paralleling

369
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
The end of an era the beginning of something new she says the back of her head she was thinking about

370
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:06,240
How the music industry might be dying it's definitely in a place where it's like what now you can hear it in the music

371
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
And you know this the biggest war in history really what now these are the Whispers that you here

372
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
But she says one of the loudest Whispers was super simple just here's a guy

373
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:24,672
About to go down the end of the world is literally on his back

374
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
It was almost as if he didn't even know that was on his back

375
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
You know what I mean it's like

376
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
That was the afterthought

377
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Like oh yeah the world ending

378
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
I don't care it's going out of style

379
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
In other words he wasn't afraid

380
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,496
He wasn't afraid

381
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,824
You know what that's what that's what this we talked about Whispers

382
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
That's what I get from it and I know you said that it's not so much I don't give it I'm not afraid I mean we all have to

383
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
To leave the planet you know everybody has their day

384
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,160
But you work on his not being afraid when you have to leave

385
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
Thank you

386
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,496
This was actually refreshing AccuWeather

387
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Walking out of that interview after we had told her that the phrase on Jay-Z's back was lifted from a book written by

388
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
Find my brother-in-law Eugene oh wow now I need to get the book in which she was very interested to know

389
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,904
Yeah let's do that and we did send in the book haven't heard back walking out of there

390
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
Keep thinking is that what this is all about

391
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
It always pop nihilism around us is not about

392
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
Turn down power structures or embracing nothingness it's just

393
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Look at me

394
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
Look how Brave I am

395
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
If I can wear it on it

396
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,616
And this is why as you pointed out you know from Dada to punk

397
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
This is a recurring

398
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
Motif of how

399
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
How badass you are in facing mortality

400
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
King Kyle badass

401
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
That's what I was

402
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
I think

403
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
But that is nothing more than a posture

404
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
I mean it's all fine when you're 18 to wear that t-shirt but when you're like in your 50s dealing with k

405
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,472
Cancer like okay you know maybe maybe then is when you really have to confront this thing

406
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
So I just it's it's simply

407
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
The posture and that's why it's in pop culture

408
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,296
So you know why we love not listening pop culture is they saves us having to be done with it

409
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
Simon critchley again saves us from feeling it

410
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
We can we can enjoy in our rooms

411
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
We can get off on it and then we let it go

412
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
And we got we got to work

413
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
Simon says you don't have to be cynical about this if you don't want to be

414
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
I mean

415
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Nietzsche

416
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
It's a dark pessimist himself

417
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
Had this idea about nihilism that it was just

418
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
The beginning

419
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
But if you really

420
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,456
Dealt with it took it in accelerated it to its logical end

421
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
You could get to the other side

422
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
What she called a revaluation of values

423
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Some you

424
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
We're thinking about who we are with small creatures

425
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
County where I am

426
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Unloved

427
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
Love is that

428
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
Capacity which can

429
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
See through that

430
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
And that he suspects is why his students were so interested in those Mystics cuz they had found a way through these people lose

431
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Mystics

432
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
The uncompromising

433
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Commitment to Samuel I love

434
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
The fact that they were ready to go all the way

435
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
Can you gate even their own bodies

436
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
For that love

437
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Brighten the world web

438
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
Where love has been reduced to Tinder exchanges

439
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,792
If that's the hell that you're living in his 25-year old then yeah you going to read this Mystic something

440
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
I want what she's having turn my flash

441
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
And you could argue

442
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,336
I mean why not that Jay Z and Beyonce a little bit of that going on

443
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,944
When part of what's made this two are so big biggest store ever actually

444
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
Is it it's like this Grand love story

445
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
I'm with the love of my life

446
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,112
So it's not it's like a work but you're a fantasy

447
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
As fantasy that

448
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Beyonce and Jay-Z will do this

449
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
Tour de will

450
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Go off into the desert

451
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
And the live

452
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936
Can a little Hut like his monastic existence

453
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
Together in love in a new a new sort of Age of Aquarius will begin

454
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
Starting with the two of them that's beautiful

455
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Any chance that you can really hear me slipper

456
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
That was your answer

457
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Pina colada on the beach

A lot of the stuff in your going to look at

And see when and where and how it was

466
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080

00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,496
Big thanks to produce Randy Mills who

475
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Process of helping me put together this podcast began to say things like

476
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,224
My friends and I we were watching this lady bug crawl around my shoe

477
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
And then it started to crawl up my leg

478
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Got caught in my leg hair

479
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,136
Go back down to the shoe we were all like huh

480
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
That's life

481
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,256
That's that they were all just bugs crawling around

482
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
On a goddamn shoe

483
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
And he was totally serious it special thanks to the Murphy Drive and 2-0 books and of course to Eugene Thacker

484
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,288
Even though he Harbors no Redemptive fantasies about human beings whatsoever

Extra so why we were putting together this

495
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Podcast

496
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
We bumped into the band liturgy

497
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
And this pic

498
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Particular

499
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Tune

500
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
I want to play for you now

501
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
This tune

502
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Gold generation

503
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
I'm obsessed

504
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
It's from liturgy off their album

505
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
After album

506
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Betika

507
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Thrill jockey throws

508
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
P.com this tune

509
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
But first attached to it is a Manifesto

510
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Scored a bit

511
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
Transmittal black metal is in fact nihilism however it has a double miles and that's final miles in a once and for all negation of the entire series

512
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Negations

513
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
With this final know we arrived it

514
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
A sort of

515
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,816
Vertiginous affirmation affirmation that is White Knuckle terrified unsentimental

516
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Encourage

517
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Here it is

518
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Generation by letter
