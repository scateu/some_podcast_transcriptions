1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,072
Are you weightless

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480
I'm Jenn I'm Robert

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
Are you guys ready to do this

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,064
You should just do this is Radiolab

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,464
All right but when your hoes come out I need you to seriously clap like you've never seen two dudes with glasses talking on microphone

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
So I just really really give it up

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
For your mostly human

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
So about a week ago we go

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
Gathered 100 people

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Into

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,176
A performance-based which is in our building. WNYC is called The Greene space

14
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
What is he doing on a Monday right because seven years previous we had made a show called talking to machine

15
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Which was all about like what happens when you talk to a computer that's pretending to be human

16
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Been since we made that show with the proliferation of bots on Twitter Russian Bots meddling in elections

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Advances in AI

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
So much interesting stuff that happened that we saw it is time to update that show we needed to do it live

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
I we thought because we have a plan in mind we wanted to put unsuspecting people into a room for a kind of show

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
Showed up

21
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,048
Free people in Michigan

22
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Flavor of a

23
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,680
Just to start things off we brought to our stage one of the guys who inspired that original show

24
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Please welcome to the stage writer Brian Christian

25
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
Truck so just a week

26
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
Can just just get things sort of oriented

27
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,784
We need to principal just redefined what a chatbot

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
He is right

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
So a chatbot is a computer program

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
That exist

31
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
To mimic and impersonate human beings

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
Like when do I run into them

33
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,424
You go to website to interact with some customer service you might find yourself talking to a chatbot

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
The US Army has a chatbot called Sergeant star that recruit

35
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
People can I ask you a question about about that that's the thing you just said

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
Chatting with customer service end up doing a lot

37
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
I'm sorry

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Wizards like it's in the middle of the night you're trying to figure out some program and it's not working and then suddenly there's

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
Like need to chat and you click on that

40
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,280
Suddenly there's need to chat

41
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
Whatever I assume many of you had this experience

42
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
I never even knew of the experiences that he's had so there's this issue always I'm always curious

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896
It seems very human when you're having that that conversation with that with a

44
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
A customer service

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Chat

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
But is there a is there a place where it

47
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Where is the line between human robots that are both present

48
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Having this uncanny feeling of

49
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Not really knowing the difference

50
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
My guess

51
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
For what it's worth is that there's a system on the back end

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Best design to sort of do triage

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
Where are the first few exchanges that are just like

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Hey how can I help

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,336
What's going on it seems like there's an issue with the such-and-such

56
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
That is basically just

57
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:34,528
A chatbot and a certain point you kind of seamlessly transition and are handed off to a real person

58
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
But without any

59
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
You know notification to you that this is half

60
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
It's deliberately left

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Opaque

62
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
At what point that happened

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
This is literally everywhere

64
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,656
It is I mean and you can't get on social media and read some comment thread without

65
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Someone accusing someone else of being a bot

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
And you know it seems

67
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
It seems maybe sort of trivial at some level but

68
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
We are now living through this political prices

69
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Of

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
How do we kind of come to terms with the idea that

71
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
We can

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
You know weaponize this kind of speech

73
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
And

74
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
How do we as consumers of the news or is users of social media

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Try to suss out

76
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Whether the people were

77
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Interacting with are in fact

78
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,983
And all this confusion about what's the machine and who's the human it can get very interest

79
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,871
In the context of the famous thought experiment named for a Greek mathematician named Alan Turing

80
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
Ryan told us about this it's called the Turing

81
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
Alan Turing he makes his famous prediction back in 90

82
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Q50 that

83
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
Will eventually get to a point sometime around the beginning of

84
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
This century

85
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Where will

86
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
Stop being able to tell that

87
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Well what's the difficulty was his sort of

88
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Prophecy

89
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
A specific prophecy was that by the year 2000

90
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
After 5 minutes of interacting by text message

91
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,007
With a payment on one hand and a chatbot on the other hand

92
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
30% of

93
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Judges

94
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,735
Would fail to tell which was the human and which was the robot a soft kind of

95
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
What Turing imagined and he predicted that

96
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
As a result of hitting this 30% threshold

97
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
We would reach a point he writes

98
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,023
Square one would speak of machines as being intelligent without expecting to be country

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
And this just existed as kind of a

100
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Part of the philosophy

101
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Of computer science

102
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
Until the early 1990s

103
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
When into the story steps Huebner

104
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
A rogue multi-millionaire

105
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Disco dance floor salesman

106
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Or what

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
A rug millionaire

108
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
Plastic portable light up disco dance floor salesman

109
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
I like the beach

110
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
The lighting the other lights up

111
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,119
But portable millionaire

112
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,447
There's apparently Millions to be made if if only

113
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
If Only You Knew

114
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
And

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
Qloader this eccentric millionaire

116
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
Decides that

117
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
This was in about 1992

118
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
That the technology was starting to get to the point

119
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Where it would be worth

120
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Not just talking about the Turing test

121
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Just as the spot experiment but

122
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Actually

123
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,255
Convening a group of people in a room once a year to actually run

124
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Attest

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,679
No background during The Loner competitions the actual loebner competition how it usually works

126
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Is it you got some participants

127
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
These are the people who have to decide what's going on they sit at computers

128
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
They stare at the computer

129
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Any chat with someone on a screen

130
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,247
They don't know it's the same one there chatting with is a person or a bot

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
Behind a curtain

132
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
You have that bot

133
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
The computer running the Bots

134
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Do you also have some humans

135
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
Who are the participants may or may not be chatting with

136
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
I've got to decide right

137
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Which atom is a person or machine

138
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,191
The Bryan many many years ago actually participated in this competition he was one of the humans behind the curtain

139
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
That was chatting with the protest

140
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,103
Emily talked to initially many years ago for the Talking Machine Show

141
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
We went into all the strategies of the computer programming

142
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,527
We're using that year to try and fool the participants but the takeaway

143
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Was that

144
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
The year that he did it

145
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
The computers flop

146
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
By and large

147
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,487
Participants were not full they knew exactly when they were talking to a human

148
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,303
When they were talking to a machine and that was a while ago

149
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
In the Green Space we ask Brian

150
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,495
Where do things stand now has it like when we last talked to you but when did we last ones of 20

151
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
11-11-11

152
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,151
Hat has it have we passed the 30% threshold in the intervening 8 years

153
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
In 2014 there was a Turing test competition that was held at which the top computer program managed to fool

154
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
30%

155
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
That's it right depending on how you want to interpret that result the controversy

156
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
He arose in this particular year because the

157
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Chatbot that one

158
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,447
Was claiming to be a 13 year old Ukrainian who is just beginning to

159
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Get a grasp on the English language

160
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
Also the machine was cheating

161
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
Private entrance exam asked its computer Ness

162
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Bye in broken grammar

163
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
Exactly if it didn't appear to understand your question

164
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
You started to have this

165
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,903
Store you could play in your own mind if I call will maybe I didn't phrase that quite right or something

166
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
Has it been broke as the has Adam in a second winner third winter or fourth winter

167
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
To the best of my knowledge we are still sort of flirting under that threshold

168
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Victories since 2014

169
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
We thought we might just do this right here

170
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
Right here in this room to our little Turing test

171
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,247
Okay unbeknownst to our audience actually lined up a chatbot from a company called Pandora box

172
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
It had almost

173
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
Passed the Turing test in head.

174
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,415
Roughly not quite but almost 25%

175
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
We got the latest version of the spot

176
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
And one person anyone in the room

177
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,423
Your your job will be decided to run some tests with the audience starting with just one person

178
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,823
I can see one hand over the edge Chalet

179
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Left okay

180
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,503
So we brought up this young woman on stage put her at a computer we told her she would be chatting with two different entities one would be

181
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
This bot Pandora bot

182
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Then the other would be me

183
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
I went off stage and sat at a computer in the dark when I went to see

184
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
She was going to chat with both of us

185
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
And not know who was who

186
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,327
Who is machine and who's human

187
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
Well I don't know and we're going to give you a time limit you can be to leave so after Jed left the stage and went back to that room

188
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Up on the screen came

189
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Two different chat dialog box

190
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
See that we have two options we've just labeled them for what he's in by color when a strawberry the other is blueberry or

191
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Code Red

192
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
And code blue

193
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
You think you can talk to both of them at the same time to jump from one to the other you got any sort of thoughts of how you can suss out weather

194
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
The thing was a person or a

195
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
Yeah I just thought I mean like my first tactics are going to be like

196
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Sort of

197
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Like

198
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
Very human emotional questions and then we'll like

199
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Go from there

200
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
I'm not going to ask

201
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,039
So when I say go you'll just go and I'll just narrate what you doing okay

202
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
3

203
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
2

204
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
1

205
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Begin

206
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Soap she started to type and first thing she did was she said hello to Strawberry okay so you got in your Christmas

207
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Well we got a somewhat sexual response hear the machine I said

208
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:54,847
I like strawberries and then you returned with strawberries are delicious and oh now it's getting warmer over there

209
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,479
Blue is a warmer as a cooler color maybe you'd like to go and discuss Aristotle with the

210
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
Look at her and she switched over and started to text the

211
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
Okay that's also a kind of a generous Sort of hope

212
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
Hi Blues EB

213
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
Blueberry roast I just realized I don't even know who I'm talking to what is your name

214
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
And you're going to answer Zandra am I not in your phone

215
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,271
Andy the blueberry has responded with a bit of shock

216
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
Talking strawberry

217
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,879
Mom's hair was red

218
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
Well that's what's wrong nothing's wrong with me is there something wrong with you

219
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Blueberry and I have a lot go

220
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,935
But remember one of these she doesn't know which key is Jack right

221
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
On the strawberry side I cannot believe him right now you don't believe right now as far as I know not unless you

222
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
X-ray vision I'm in the room next to you both

223
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
He's trying to coax you into thinking that he's Jad

224
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Is the blueberry

225
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Is that something they do

226
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,183
I don't know I am there you're at the heart of the question I got to ask you to bring this to a

227
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
After couple minutes of this

228
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
We asked the audience

229
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,863
You have strawberry on one side and you look a blueberry on the other which one do you think is Jad

230
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
And which one do you think

231
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
But how many of you think

232
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
That Jad is blueberry

233
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
A few of you

234
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,687
13 hands wine up something like that how many you think the jet is strawberry

235
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
Almost everybody overwhelming

236
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,391
But interesting we are volunteer on stage went against the room he thought Chad was blueberries

237
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,279
Is that what we all agreed know you're against the crowd here

238
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,375
Okay it's much better theater

239
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
All right

240
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,751
Which one are you jack comes out from his hiding place and he tells

241
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Trout in fact he is

242
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Strawberry

243
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,967
All right so the crowd was right I definitely never had that much

244
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Chemistry with something that was human

245
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
But our volunteer on stage

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,463
Got it

247
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
Maybe we could trust democracy little bit more and believe

248
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,007
If the most of the people in the room went one way that that's something that would be you know that would be important

249
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,615
Find out so we decide to do the entire thing over again for everybody in the room

250
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
Yes so what we did was we handed out I think 17 different cell phone numbers evenly through the crowd yes look at the number

251
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
That is on

252
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Your envelope only you

253
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
Roughly half of those numbers were texting to a

254
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Machine half were texting with a group of humans

255
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,839
They were our staff the crowded not know which was which exactly so he would go get ready

256
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Get set

257
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
And

258
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Bakugou

259
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,751
Okay so the crowd about hunt people are so had

260
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
2 minutes ish

261
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
Text with the person or thing on the other end

262
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
We're going to skip over this park is mostly quiet people

263
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
Just looking down at their phones concentrating mightily

264
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
But at the end

265
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
We asked everyone to vote where they texting with a person or a bot a billy ask the ones who have been tricked who turned out.

266
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
What's wrong please stand up

267
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Who's in this room

268
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
The wrong guy

269
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
People are the right type correct

270
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
So that means that roughly

271
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
I think like

272
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
45% of the people were wrong meeting that if we just passed away today

273
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Is the strange moment we were all clapping

274
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Heroine demise

275
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,463
Because you know touring lay down this number 30% in the Box headphones way more people than that

276
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm just now going to ask you have you been a veteran of this that we should disqualified this was him really unscientific

277
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,775
Super sloppy experiment suggest something

278
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
That maybe

279
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
What changes not so much due to the machine is becoming more and more articulate

280
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
It's more like

281
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
The way

282
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
We when I talk to one another these days

283
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
We've gone from

284
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Interacting in person

285
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
To talk over the phone

286
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Emailing

287
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
To texting

288
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,487
And now I mean for me the great irony is that even to text

289
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Your phone is

290
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,631
Proactively suggesting turns of phrase that it thinks you might want to use

291
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Cancel

292
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
I assume many people in this room have the experience

293
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Are you use the word it's not a real word

294
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Assertive slabs

295
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,063
And just replaces it with something more normal

296
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Which make it really hard to use

297
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Words

298
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Why aren't the normal words until you just stop using those words he just use the word the computer lights

299
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,887
A sentence with seems to be happening is an hour human communication

300
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Is becoming more machine like

301
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,519
It seems like the Turing test

302
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,847
Getting past not because the machines have met us at our full

303
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Potential but because

304
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,735
We are using ever more and more kind of degree

305
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,855
Serta brooch forms of communication with one another

306
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
Feels like a slow slide down a hill or something

307
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Yes

308
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Down that Hill

309
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Inevitability that we met

310
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Maybe they're bad

311
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
I don't I don't like the way this is going no matter who sings

312
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
Who's doing it but in the next time we're going to we're going to flip things a little bit

313
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,615
Could the coming age of machines actually make us

314
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Humans

315
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
More human

316
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
So can we please stick around

317
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,119
This is AJ's galante calling from Chicago Illinois

318
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,471
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

320
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
More information about Sloan

321
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Www.

Sloan. Org

323
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

324
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
And I'm here because I need your help

325
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
And I request

326
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

327
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,703
About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance

328
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,799
Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something

329
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

330
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

331
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
To you

332
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

333
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score or maybe the kids in math class

334
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,303
I noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

335
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

336
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Anything to do with the test

337
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
If you have a story

338
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
T-shirt with us

339
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,871
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

340
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
Record a short audio message for us

341
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
And that's radiolab.org brilliant

342
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Thank you so much

343
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Dam Jad Robert this is Radiolab Orbach

344
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
The last segment

345
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
We got a bunch of people in the performance space here at WNYC and we conducted a unscientific

346
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,663
The creation of the Turing test and in our case the bought one

347
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Afford more than 30% of the people in the room that we should point out that the woman who headed up the design of the winning by

348
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
What name is Lauren kunze she works for a company called

349
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Pandora box

350
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
And she was actually in the room like they are sitting in a chair in the audience

351
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,679
Where can you stand up

352
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
Aunt interesting that one of the things the Lauren mansion

353
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
Is that the baci design

354
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Seems to bring out rather consistently a certain

355
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Side of people

356
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Bad fat

357
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,087
So the spot over 20% of people who talk to her and millions of conversations every week

358
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
Actually make romantic overtures

359
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,511
And that's pretty consistent across all the boss on our platform so there's something wrong with us

360
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Stop the robot

361
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Alright alright alright

362
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Which brings up a actually different kind of

363
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
Like this for a second let's forget whether we're being fooled

364
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
Into thinking about is actually a human

365
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Maybe the more important

366
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
Given this increasing presence

367
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
All these machines in our lives

368
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
Just like how do they make us behave

369
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
We did our toe into this world

370
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,647
In a Turing test esort away in that original show seven years ago and play you an excerpt now

371
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
How to set up

372
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
What comes after

373
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Okay

374
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,535
This is freedom Barre

375
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Is not mushy

376
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,191
I don't think so they're nice to meet both of you an idea that we borrowed from a woman named Freedom Baird

377
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
Who is now a visual artist of the time she was a grad student at MIT doing some research and she was also the proud owner

378
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Owner of a Furby

379
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,991
Yeah I've got it right here I do not get against the mic so we can hear it

380
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,159
You describe a Furby for those of us who

381
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
It's about 5 in

382
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Tall

383
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
And the Furby is

384
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,351
Pretty much all head it's just a big round fluffy head with two little feet

385
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
Sticking out the front it has big eyes

386
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
Apparently you make noises if you tickle its tummy it will coo

387
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
It would stay

388
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Me

389
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
It would want you to just

390
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Keep playing with it

391
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,855
So one day she's hanging out with her for a week and she notices something

392
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
What I discovered is if you hold it upside

393
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
It will say

394
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
Me scared

395
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
Scared

396
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
You know the sort of owner / user of this Furby would get really uncomfortable with that and then

397
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Turn it back up upright

398
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Cuz once you up to have it up Friday

399
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
It's fine

400
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,112
And then it's fine so it's got some sensor in it that knows

401
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
You know what direction a

402
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Or maybe it's just

403
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
This could be

404
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,424
Sort of the new way that you could use to draw the line but

405
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
What's human

406
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
What's machine

407
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,592
His kind of emotional Turing test

408
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Can you guys hear me

409
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Are you actually wanted to do this

410
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Could you help how would we do it

411
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
How you guys doing

412
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
You would need

413
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,928
Group of kids just tell me your name Olivia

414
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
Sakura tomorrow and I'm Sadie

415
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
I'm thinking 6 7 and 8 year olds olds

416
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
7 reason

417
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
You know Vince is beating we're going to need three things

418
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Furby

419
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Barbie Barbie doll

420
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
And Ruby

421
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
As a gerbil

422
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
A real jerk

423
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
We did find one

424
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,064
Your hamster but we're going to call you Jeremy got Barbie Furby Furby Furby

425
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
What question are we asking in this

426
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
The question was

427
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
How long can you keep it upside down

428
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
Before you yourself feel

429
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
So we should time the kids as they hold each one upside

430
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Yep

431
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,192
You're going to have a Barbie that's a dog going to Jeremy which is a lie

432
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
Ruby Falls

433
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
In terms of time held upside down

434
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
That was really the question

435
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Phase one

436
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Okay so

437
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,296
Here's what we're going to do it's going to be really simple and you would have to say well here's a Barbie do you guys play with Barbies

438
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,624
Do a couple things a few things with Barbie and Barbie's walk

439
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Looking looking at the

440
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
And then

441
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Old Barbie house

442
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Upside down

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
Dave see how long you can

444
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Can hold Barbie

445
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,424
I can probably do it obviously very long

446
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
You feel like

447
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
I'm happy

448
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,504
This one on forever siliceous passport a bit

449
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
Gay and

450
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Can I put my arms

451
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Yo Gabba Gabba

452
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
So what we learn here in Phase 1 is the not surprising fact

453
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
Kids can hold Barbie dolls

454
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Upside down

455
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
About 5 minutes

456
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
Nebulae was forever

457
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
Couldn't longer with their arms

458
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
All right

459
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
So that was the first

460
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
Time for face to be the same thing

461
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
With

462
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Derby

463
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
So out with Barbie

464
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
With

465
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
Derby

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,040
Are we going to have to hold them upside down

467
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,904
Ask yeah so which one of you would like to

468
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Ready

469
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
You have to hold your pee kind of firmly

470
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
By the way no Road

471
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
S-400 missile

472
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Squirmy wormy

473
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
To be upside down

474
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Don't do that

475
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Soaz

476
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
You heard

477
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
The kids turned to be over very fast

478
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Get hurt

479
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
On average

480
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
8 Seconds

481
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
I was thinking

482
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Oh my God I got to poop

483
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
It was a torture

484
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Now faced

485
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
This is

486
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
A Furby

487
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
You take forever in your hands

488
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Now can you turn Furby upside down holder

489
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Baby client

490
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Tina Turner

491
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Ik

492
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,056
So gerbil was 8 seconds Barbie

493
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
5 to Infinity

494
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Furby turned out to be

495
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Freedom predicted this

496
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
The kids seem to treat this Furby.

497
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Toy more like a gerbil

498
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
Phenobarbital how come you turn them over

499
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
I didn't run

500
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Do you think he really felt scared

501
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Yeah kinda

502
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
I kind of felt

503
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Okay

504
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Really

505
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
It's at Oriole and all that but still

506
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,008
Did you remember at the time when you felt scared

507
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Yeah

508
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,176
You have to tell me about it but if you can remember it in your mind

509
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:32,064
Do you think when Furby says me scared that Furbies feeling the same way

510
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Yeah

511
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
No no

512
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Yeah yeah

513
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
I think that it can feel pain

514
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Sword

515
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
Experience with a Furby seem to leave the kids

516
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Conflicted

517
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
Going in different directions at once

518
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Mm the same time

519
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
One thought was like

520
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,688
Look I get it for crying out loud

521
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,248
Still he's helpless

522
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,576
China baby killed guilty in a sword away

523
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880
And I made me feel like a coward

524
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
You know when I was interacting with my Furby a lot

525
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,536
I did have this feeling sometimes of having my

526
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Chang yang

527
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
Why would it why would a

528
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,192
Is it just a little squeal didn't think there's just something about the tower that makes

529
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,288
Good at this kind of my question so I called them as well

530
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
I'm here

531
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Freight train of guy from Radiolab Jad from Radiolab

532
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,112
Set this point in that old show we ended up talking to a guy named Caleb Chung who designed the Furby

533
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
There's rules there

534
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,488
You know the size of the eyes there's the distance of the top lid to the pupil

535
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,328
Right you don't want any of the top of the white of your eye showing that's that's

536
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
That's freaky

537
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:53,216
Surprised to talk to him for a long time about all the sort of trick to use to program the Furby to prompt

538
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
Kids to think of it

539
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:59,872
As a living thing and he objected interesting Leah 1.2 thinking of it as a knot

540
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Exactly a living thing

541
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
How is that

542
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
Different than us wait a second toe are you really going to go all the way there

543
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,368
Absolutely this is a toy with Servo Motors and things that move its eyelids

544
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
100 words

545
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,488
So you're saying that life is a level of complexity

546
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
If something is alive it's just more complex

547
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
I think I'm saying that life is driven by the need to

548
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
To be alive

549
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
And by these base

550
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,752
Animal feelings like pain and suffering I can code that

551
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
I can code

552
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:33,664
What do you mean you can code that anyone who write software and they do can say okay I need stay alive

553
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Therefore I'm going to come up with ways to

554
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,272
To stay alive going to do it in a way that's very human I'm going to do it

555
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,600
We can mimic these things by saying that he is my name

556
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,672
This feeling of fear it's not the same thing as being

557
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,720
Scared it's not feeling scared

558
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
It is

559
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
How is Zeus

560
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
Began to a rather long back and forth would you say a cockroach is alive

561
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,568
About like what is the exact definition of life where is that Limekiln people machines but

562
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,152
When we came back to Freedom food it got me started on this

563
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Spin Interac

564
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
She says we're really stuck with her

565
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,088
Is that that little toy as simple as it is

566
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Can have such a profound effect

567
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:22,048
On a human being one thing that was really fascinating to me was my husband and I gave

568
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
A Furby as a gift

569
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
2

570
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
His

571
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
Grandmother who had Alzheimer's

572
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
And

573
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
She

574
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Loved it

575
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
Everyday for her was kind of knew and

576
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,408
Somewhat disorienting but she had this cute little toy that

577
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
Kiss me

578
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
I love you and she thought it was the most

579
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
Delightful thing and its little beak with

580
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
Covered with lipstick

581
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Because she would

582
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
Pick it up and kiss it everyday and

583
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,024
She didn't actually have a long-term relationship with it

584
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
For her it was always a short-term interaction

585
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
So this is what I'm describing as a kind of thinness for her was was just right because that's what she was

586
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Capable of

587
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Hello hello

588
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:16,832
Hey Caleb hey Caleb it's Dad hey Dad how are you I am fabulous

589
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
Feels Like Only Yesterday we were talking about

590
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,768
Dissentients of the Furby

591
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:30,912
So we brought Caleb back into the studio because in the years since we spoke with him he's worked on a lot of these

592
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
Animatronic toys including a famous one called the pleo

593
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,336
And in the process has been thinking a lot about how these toys can push our button

594
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
As humans

595
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
And how

596
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
As a toy maker that means he's got to be

597
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,784
Really thoughtful about how use that and worked when a baby doll

598
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Right now we done one

599
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
And where and the baby doll and animatronic baby doll is this

600
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Probably the hardest thing to do

601
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
Because you know you do one thing wrong it's Chucky

602
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,840
Link to slow if their eyes are too wide and also you're giving it the most

603
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,168
Vulnerable of our species which is our young were

604
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,776
Practicing being nurturing moms for their kids

605
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
So let's say the baby just falls asleep right

606
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
We're trying to write in this kind of code

607
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
And I

608
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
And

609
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Stop so you've just

610
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
Give give the baby a bottle and you put it down to take a nap

611
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Turn down the quiet

612
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,256
And so what I want to do as the baby falls asleep it goes into a deeper sleep but if you bump it right after it lays down

613
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Then it wakes back up

614
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
We're trying to write in this kind of code

615
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Cuz that seems like a nice way

616
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
To reinforce

617
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Best practices for Mommy right

618
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
So I know my responsibilities

619
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
In this

620
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
A large party says because he hasn't always gotten

621
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,456
And it right here there's a great example

622
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
His name is

623
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Leo

624
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
That's him

625
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,160
I don't know if you've ever seen the pleo dino we did

626
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Artificial intelligence

627
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Cleo was a robotic dinosaur pretty small

628
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:06,400
Barefoot from nose to tail look a lot like the dinosaur little foot from the movie Land Before Time

629
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
Very cute very lifelike

630
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
And we went hog-wild in and putting real emotions in it and

631
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Reactions

632
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,504
The fear and everything right it is quite a step forward

633
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Is it makes

634
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
The Furby

635
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Looks like Child's Play

636
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,184
Got the two microphones built in cameras to

637
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Track and recognize you

638
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Faceit can

639
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
Feel the beat of a song

640
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
And then with

641
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,448
Dozens of Motors in it it condemned dance along to that song in total there are 40 sensors in this toy

642
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,080
It's so it it follows you around

643
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
Wanting you to pet it

644
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
As you're petting it will fall asleep

645
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
It is undeniably

646
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Adorable

647
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
And

648
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,672
Caleb says his intent from the beginning was

649
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,000
Very simple to create a toy that would encourage you

650
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
To show love

651
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
And caring

652
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
In our belief is it

653
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
But humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to

654
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
Be more human than we think we can

655
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Cut that out by having

656
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
All creatures that you can love me

657
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
That was Caleb demonstrating the pleo at a TED Talk

658
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,968
And what's interesting is it in keeping with this idea wanting to encourage empathy

659
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
Key programmed in some behaviors into the pleo

660
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
That he hoped would nudge people in the right direction

661
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
For example pleio will let you know if you do something that it doesn't like so if you actually moved his leg when his mother was moving a

662
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
And he would interpret that has pain

663
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
Or abuse

664
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
And he would limp around and he would cry

665
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
And then he trembled and then he would take a while before he warmed up to you again

666
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
And so what happened is

667
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
We launched this thing

668
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
And there's a website called device

669
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,712
This is sort of a tech product review website

670
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
They got a hold of a pleo

671
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
And they put up a video

672
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
What you seen the videos pleo on a table

673
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Being beat

674
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,656
You don't see who's doing it exactly you just see Hands coming in from out of the frame and knocking him over

675
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
Again and again

676
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,056
You see the toys legs in the air struggling to that

677
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Right itself

678
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
They're like a turtle that's trying to get off

679
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
And it started crying

680
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Cuz that's what it does

681
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,000
These guys start holding upside down by its tail

682
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
Hail

683
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
They smash its head into the table a few times

684
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
And you can see in the video that it responds

685
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Like it's been stunned

686
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Stumbling around

687
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
At one point they even start strangling

688
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
It actually starts to choke

689
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
Finally they pick it up by its tail one more time

690
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Hellobyte sale

691
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
And hit it and it was crying and then started screaming in a

692
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
They beat it

693
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Until it died

694
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Write well

695
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Until it just did not work anymore

696
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:40,672
This video was viewed about a hundred thousand times many more times than the

697
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Reviews

698
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
The Cleo in Caleb says there's something about the city

699
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Just

700
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Can't shake

701
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Because

702
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
Whether it's alive or not that's

703
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
That's exhibiting sociopathic Behavior

704
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,496
He's not sure what brought out that sociopath

705
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,568
Behavior whether there was some design in the toy

706
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
Whether offering people

707
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
Are there chance to see a toy in pain in this way somehow

708
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Brought out

709
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Curiosity

710
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,600
I kind of cruel curiosity he's just not sure

711
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,464
What happens when you turn ear and animatronic baby upside down will it cry

712
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
I'm not sure yet I mean we're working on next versions right now right

713
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,448
What would you do I mean it's a good question

714
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
You have to have some kind of response otherwise it seems

715
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
Broken right

716
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,360
But you know if you make him react at all

717
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
Going to get that repetitive abuse because it's

718
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Cool to watch

719
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Extreme

720
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,808
It sounds like you have maybe an inner conflict about this shirt that you might even be pulling back

721
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Jamaica

722
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,416
Extra life like yeah I'm I'm for my little company I have

723
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
I've adopted kind of a hypocrite

724
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
Hippocratic Oath like

725
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
You know

726
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Don't teach something that's wrong

727
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
Or don't reinforce something is wrong

728
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
And so I've been working on this problem for years

729
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,032
I'm struggling with what's this what's the right thing to do

730
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
You know

731
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Yeah

732
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Since you have the

733
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Power

734
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
Since you have the ability

735
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,040
To turn on and off chemicals at some level in another human

736
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Which ones do you choose

737
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
And so this gets the bigger question of AI

738
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,744
Write this is the question in AI

739
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
I'm going to jump to this cuz it's really the same question is

740
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
You know how do we

741
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
Create things that can help us

742
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
You know I'm dealing that on a microscopic

743
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Scale but this is the question

744
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
And so

745
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
The first thing that I would try to teach our new AI

746
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
If I had the ability is

747
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
Try to understand the concept of empathy

748
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
We need to introduce the idea of empathy

749
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Both in an AI and us

750
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
For these things

751
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
That's

752
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Where we're at

753
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,264
Caleb says in the specific case of the of the animatronic babies designing

754
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,360
At least we talked to his thinking was that he might have it

755
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
He holds it upside down cry once or twice but then stop

756
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
So that you don't get that

757
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Repeat thrill

758
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Yeah

759
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
I was wondering whether

760
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888
Back in the grid space with Brian Christian and Beck on the subject

761
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Chatbot

762
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,984
We found ourselves asking the very question that

763
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Calebasse

764
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Is it possible that

765
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
This is getting kind of grim

766
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
That maybe

767
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Then some

768
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,272
In some ways tripods are good for humans yeah means there any situation where you can throw in a couple of pots and things get better

769
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,344
What can chatbots actually be helpful

770
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
For us and if so

771
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
How

772
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah there have been some academic studies on trying to use

773
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Chatbots for these

774
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Is Humane

775
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Benevolent

776
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
That I think

777
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Type this in

778
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Interesting

779
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Other narrative

780
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
I am so for example

781
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Researchers have

782
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
Tried injecting chatbots into

783
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Twitter

784
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
And the spot will just show up and be like

785
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
And does it just like that

786
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,512
You know it'll say something like they're real people behind the keyboard and you're really hurting someone's

787
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,424
And you know it's sort of preliminary work but there are some studies that appear to see

788
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Suggest yunnan

789
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
Sharp decline in that users use

790
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Hate speech

791
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
FCI of 50 trillion followers

792
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
Oh yeah it actually does depends that isn't

793
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
It does depend on the follower count

794
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,392
Of the bot that makes the intervention

795
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
So if you perceive this bought

796
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
To be

797
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
It also requires that you think are person so this

798
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,096
Is it started flirting with it with dark magic

799
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,424
But if you perceive them to be

800
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
Higher status on the platform

801
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Then yourself

802
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Then you will

803
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
Tntap sheepishly fall in line

804
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
But if the bottom

805
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
Has fewer followers than the user is trying to

806
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Correct

807
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
That will just instigate the

808
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
The bully to believe them

809
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
Now in addition

810
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
Wow

811
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,440
Human Nature

812
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,792
Very cool thing I ever going to finish but this is like this is the

813
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
All right so I'm going to tell you one more story because as we were thinking about all this and trying to find a more optimistic place to live

814
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
We bumped into a story

815
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
From this guy

816
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Who are you

817
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,480
So I'm I'm a Josh Rothman I'm a writer for the New Yorker

818
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
Run into the studio couple weeks back

819
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,600
Who's this

820
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
Story of yours large it takes

821
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Place in a laboratory

822
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:07,072
In Barcelona at the lab it's in Barcelona and it's run by a couple minutes later and mavi son

823
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,168
Chess Vives Vives neuroscientist

824
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472
They have these two VR Labs together

825
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
VR as in virtual reality

826
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,824
And Josh took a trip

827
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
The Barcelona

828
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
To experience some of the simulations that Navien melt

829
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
Wet

830
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Campusship

831
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,296
Their lab you feel sort of like you're going to a Black Box Theatre

832
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
It's sort of like a lot of big rooms

833
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,904
All covered in black with curtains

834
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:37,536
There's a lot of dark spaces and explain the what's going to happen is going to put on a headset

835
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
Is there a big helmet and eventually

836
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Peterson

837
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
The visual start

838
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
Fade in

839
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
This room

840
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,479
Appears you're standing in a sort of generic room the graphics look straight out of like a Windows 95

841
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,063
Computer game is like the loading screen of the VR

842
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
And then

843
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
That dissolves

844
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
Then it's replaced with the simulation

845
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
And when the simulation started

846
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,911
I was standing in front of a mirror a digital mirror in this digital world

847
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
Reflecting back at him his digital self

848
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Is Avatar

849
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151
So basically you move and your beautiful body moves with you I could see in the mirror

850
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
A reflection of myself but the person who's who

851
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
The self thought I saw a reflected

852
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
She had a body through the woman

853
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
She

854
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
So I think when people think of virtual reality they often imagine

855
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,023
Wanted to have like realistic experiences

856
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
NVR

857
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
But that's not what melon mommy do

858
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
They are interested in VR precisely cuz it lets you experience things you could never experience in your real body in the

859
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
Real world that body that can be completely transformed and Campbell fan contains coloring

860
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Change shape

861
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
So it's can give you a very very

862
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Unique

863
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Tool to wax

864
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:09,695
Explorer in their work they'll often in Industry our world turn men and women as they did for Josh for his

865
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
His first timeout

866
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
They will

867
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
How to take a tall person and then make them a short person

868
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
In the VR

869
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
So that they can experience the world as a short person

870
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Crane their neck up a bunch

871
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
They'll change the color of your skin NPR end

872
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,407
Run you through scenarios where you are having to experience the world as another race

873
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,503
And what's remarkable is it in all of these manipulations

874
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,807
Apparently you adjust to the new body

875
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
Very quickly

876
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
They've done physiological tests

877
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Measure this

878
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
It takes almost no time at all to

879
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
Feel as if this alien body is actually yours they call this the illusion of presence

880
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
Ingleside water body

881
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
I-70

882
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,727
Stable entity however

883
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
By running

884
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
Experiments in virtual reality

885
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
You see that's actually it in

886
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
In one minute

887
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Elvis stimulation

888
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
How are brain except a different body

889
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Even if this body is

890
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
It's quite different from your own

891
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,415
And this flexibility that our brains seem to have

892
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Can lead to some very

893
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Surreal

894
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Situations

895
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
This is really a story that brought us to ja she told us

896
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,423
About another VR Adventure where again he put on the headset

897
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
This world fade it up

898
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
And I was sitting in a chair

899
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
In front of a desk

900
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
In a

901
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Really cool looking modernist house

902
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
Wooden floor sanding there is

903
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,527
Some glass walls and through glass walls

904
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,111
Field with wildflowers

905
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,439
Again he noticed a mirror and this time the reflection the mirror

906
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
Was of him

907
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
It was a realistic-looking Avatar of him

908
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
After checking out his digital self for a while

909
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
He turned his head back

910
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,191
To the room and realized it across the room

911
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
There was another desk

912
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
And behind this other desk with there was Freud

913
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Who Freud

914
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud

915
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,735
Middle-aged man with a big brown beard and a beard

916
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
He had glasses

917
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
And

918
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
He was just sitting there with his hands folded in his lap

919
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,415
Digicert taking this all and he's looking at

920
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Voice looking

921
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Back at him

922
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:24,863
And then okay now and now I use the voice of a researcher in his ear coming through his VR helmet

923
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
She explained what you're going to do is

924
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,151
You're going to explain a problem that you're having a personal problem that you're having to Freud

925
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,223
Something that's bothering you in your life

926
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
And she said

927
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
Take a minute think about what you'd like to discuss

928
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,647
Do something immediately jump to mind ya so

929
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
You know my my mom

930
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
Had a stroke a few years ago

931
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
And she's in a nursing home

932
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
And I'm her guardian

933
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
So

934
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
She's

935
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
65

936
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
But because of the stroke she

937
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
Like needs 24-hour care and you can't talk

938
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
Shouldn't have any words any

939
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
So

940
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
It's a very tough

941
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Sing for me

942
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
I thought really hard about where she

943
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
You should live at why I live here in New York

944
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
My mom

945
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Lives in Virginia

946
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,415
Just as he really debated for a long time should he put her in a nursing home in New York

947
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
Where he can be closer to her or

948
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
Should he put her in a nursing home in Virginia or he would be far away she has all these friends and family members down there

949
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
So in the end I decided

950
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,263
You know find a place for her there where there's lots of people who can visit

951
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
So I go down

952
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Maybe once every

953
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Month or six weeks

954
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
Ecstasy my mom but then every weekend

955
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
You know

956
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Someone from this

957
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
Super Friends Are Family relatives visit

958
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
Turn down there where the fuhrer. On video on the first

959
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
Decision I made

960
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,439
But you don't feel really happy then yeah you know I feel guilty about it

961
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Like he was a terrible son

962
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
And he said he would especially have that feeling each week after

963
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:03,679
Her friends would visit her in the nursing home and then send him an email update saying hey this is how your mom is doing

964
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Every time he would read one of those emails

965
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Even if she was doing well his stomach which is

966
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,335
Drop this problem this emotion

967
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
Feeling guilty

968
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Is 1

969
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
Felt for a while

970
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
So I said to Freud

971
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
I said

972
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
My mom is in a nursing home in another state

973
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
And

974
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,743
Friends and family visit her and they send me reports

975
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,815
And how she's doing and I always feel really bad

976
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
When I get these reports

977
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,495
And this is said in your voice if you'd blakey's that the mirror while you were talking would you be saying it

978
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
So after he said this

979
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,591
To Freud the world sort of

980
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Beat It Out

981
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Two black

982
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
And then it faded back in

983
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
And suddenly the world has shifted

984
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
NewsNow across the room

985
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,599
Behind the desk that you just been opposite in

986
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,183
He was inside the body of Freud you look down himself he's wearing white

987
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
White shirt grey suit

988
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,047
There's a mirror next to that desk me looks himself

989
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,191
I have a little beard and everything looks just like Freud but the main thing that was really surprising was that a cross I could see myself

990
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
So this is the Avatar of me now

991
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
And I

992
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Washed myself

993
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
Say what I just said so

994
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
Oh well so it plays it back

995
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Exactly

996
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
Dell recording is now replate

997
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
Movements and also the voice

998
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
And they see themselves

999
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
As they talked about their problem

1000
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,791
The first I can see my I'm sitting in the chair and sort of uncomfortable

1001
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
I'm moving around

1002
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
I take my hands and

1003
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
Put them in my lap and fold them together and I take

1004
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Come apart

1005
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
I can watch myself be nervous

1006
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,847
And then I saw

1007
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,919
Then I saw myself say what I just said my mom is in a nursing

1008
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Another state

1009
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Friends and family visit

1010
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Send me reports

1011
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
In my voice

1012
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,695
I'm going to moving the way I move in

1013
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
It was just like me watching myself

1014
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
And I guess the best way

1015
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
I can describe that

1016
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Was

1017
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
It was moving

1018
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
What movie

1019
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,615
Emotionally emotionally

1020
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
I felt

1021
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
But I don't know if this is going to make any sense but

1022
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
You know how there's a point in your life where you realize that your parents are just people

1023
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Yeah it was kind of like that

1024
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
Is upset with me

1025
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,839
Did you feel closer to that guy or or I felt bad

1026
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
He felt bad for him

1027
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Sorry

1028
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,983
Yeah I did I fry my my feelings went out

1029
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Up to this other person

1030
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Who is me

1031
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
As he's having this empathetic reaction as Freud

1032
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Looking back at himself

1033
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,943
The researchers voice again appears in his ear

1034
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
If advice

1035
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,039
From the perspective of Sigmund Freud

1036
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
Advice of Hardee's

1037
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:06,207
Problem could be solved how you could deal with it essentially respond to your patient

1038
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
I don't know what to say so I said

1039
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Why do you think you feel bad

1040
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,167
What's a good pretty

1041
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Why do you think you feel bad

1042
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Soon as he ask that

1043
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
He's back

1044
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
In his body is virtual body staring back at virtual Freud and he sees a playback of Freud asking him that question I watched

1045
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Freud stages

1046
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
This to me why do you think you feel bad

1047
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,807
Except that when Freud talks they had some

1048
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Thing in the program that made

1049
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
His voice

1050
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
Extra deep

1051
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
Mikasa

1052
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Voice distortion

1053
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:44,095
How deep are boys his voice didn't sound like my voice how did you respond as he has now you

1054
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
I said I feel bad

1055
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Because

1056
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,215
It doesn't seem right that I'm

1057
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,263
Looking for a way

1058
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
Once again

1059
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,615
He switches bodies now he's in Freud again staring back

1060
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,431
I'm self and I watched myself say this

1061
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,199
I feel bad

1062
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
And then is Freud I said well why

1063
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
Why are you far away then

1064
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
Shoot back into his own body

1065
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
Protecting from across the room why are you far away though

1066
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
I said well because

1067
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,303
If my mom lived in New York I'd be the only person here but

1068
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
If she's down

1069
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,399
And where she lives that there's other people to visit her

1070
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,215
That confronts potty

1071
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,031
And I said so it sounds like there's there's a reason

1072
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Why I'm

1073
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
Why you live where you live

1074
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,199
I'm so if you know that won't hit why do you why do you still feel bad

1075
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
Switch is back to himself if you know they're white

1076
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
I said something like

1077
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
You're right

1078
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
Back at the front

1079
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,399
And then it's Friday I said you know it sounds like the

1080
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
The thing that's making you unhappy which is

1081
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
Making you feel bad we're just getting used

1082
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,359
Reports from these people is actually the whole reason why you

1083
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
Decided

1084
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,711
To live and he's going to have to keep your mom where she is

1085
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
Like there's a a loop

1086
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,855
Right it's like these these reports I get for my mom's

1087
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,927
Friends make me feel bad but the whole reason why

1088
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
I

1089
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:18,047
Decided to leave her in this place in Virginia is specifically so that there are friends

1090
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Who can visit her

1091
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
This is classic idea in psychology called the refrain which is where

1092
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,519
Giant take a problem and reframe that problem into its solution

1093
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
He says in that moment he kind of did that

1094
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
It is very simple Epiphany that

1095
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
His guilt

1096
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
Was actually connected to something good

1097
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
I never had that thought before

1098
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,343
He chose to keep his mom in Virginia so that her friends would visit her more in

1099
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
Each time her friends visited he felt bad

1100
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
That meant they were visiting

1101
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
To the bad feeling ineffective

1102
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Was feeling it so much

1103
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,375
Was itself kind of evidence for the fact that he had made

1104
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
If not the right decision

1105
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
At least a decision that made sense

1106
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,591
Experience I had talking to myself as Freud was was nothing like the experience I had

1107
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
In my own head

1108
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
Turning this issue over and over

1109
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Buy sweet tea

1110
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,223
Back and forth

1111
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
Hey by swapping bodies

1112
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
Somehow you can give advice

1113
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
I am

1114
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
American Best

1115
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
When I was back in my own body and Freud set it to me either

1116
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Just like

1117
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
I just felt like gum

1118
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Wow

1119
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
It's so good point

1120
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:29,727
When your next 30 what the hell is going on here why am I able in this

1121
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
Utterly fictive situation

1122
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,639
Split myself in two and heal myself while I put the headset off

1123
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,967
And I sat there for a little while while the

1124
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Researchers

1125
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Look at me

1126
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,855
Trying to make sense of it and I think what

1127
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
What I keep coming back to is the

1128
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
Seeing yourself just as a person

1129
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
Not as you

1130
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,863
Not with all the complexities and

1131
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Stuff

1132
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,191
That is in you

1133
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Yourself

1134
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
Experience of being yourself

1135
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,335
And this might be the real key thing like when you are in your body

1136
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
Would you pretty much always are

1137
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
You have all of these thoughts and feelings which are at

1138
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Attached

1139
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
To that body

1140
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,623
When you go home for Thanksgiving and you walk into your parents kitchen and suddenly you just

1141
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
Kind of feel

1142
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,951
Like you're a teenager again

1143
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
I call those same thought patterns from your youth

1144
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Kind of kick back into gear

1145
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
Because the context

1146
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
That kitchen

1147
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Is power

1148
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
And you your body

1149
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,287
Is that writ large but if you can jump out of it go into a new one

1150
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
Suddenly all those constraints

1151
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Penelec contact

1152
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Is gone

1153
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
When I'm in body does

1154
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Freud

1155
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
Not only do I look different

1156
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
This is my body

1157
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
But I feel different

1158
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,367
And I have different types of thoughts

1159
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
And I see

1160
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
People differently

1161
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
Josh says what he saw

1162
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,047
What he was Freud looking back at himself

1163
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
Was just a guy who needed help

1164
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,655
When someone comes to you and ask for help

1165
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
Your feelings are not

1166
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
They're just

1167
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
Tenderness

1168
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Kindness

1169
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
Your instinct is to

1170
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Help them

1171
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,711
He says he's able to bring that very simple way of being

1172
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Back to himself

1173
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
Did it did it make a difference

1174
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
Did you walk out of that with with a different

1175
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
Feeling about yourself

1176
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Did I think

1177
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
I've had a feeling of

1178
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
I think it revised my

1179
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
Feeling about

1180
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Who I was

1181
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
I think it made me feel a little more

1182
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,983
I don't even have a word for it

1183
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
A little more human

1184
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:58,463
Joshua writer the New Yorker his story first appeared there

1185
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:02,303
And we told it to that live audience at the Greene space

1186
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
So Brian this is

1187
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
You can get the last word

1188
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,007
Tell me this is really interesting because the history of

1189
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Chatbots

1190
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,055
Begins

1191
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
With a chatbot program written in the 60

1192
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Please find MIT

1193
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Professor

1194
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
Joseph weizenbaum

1195
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
The program is called Eliza

1196
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
It was designed to mimic

1197
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,855
This non-directive rogerian therapist

1198
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Where you would say I'm feeling

1199
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
I'm sad it would just

1200
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Throw it back to you as a

1201
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
The kind of mad lib

1202
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,511
I'm sorry to hear your sad why are you sad

1203
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,839
And why isn't bomb was

1204
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,911
Is famously horrified when he walked in on his

1205
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
Secretary just like

1206
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Spilling her life

1207
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
Innermost thoughts

1208
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,311
In feelings to this program that she had seen him right

1209
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
You know there's no there's no mystery there

1210
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
But he came away from that

1211
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Experience feeling

1212
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Call that the

1213
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
The degree to which p

1214
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
People will sword

1215
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Project

1216
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,111
Human intention on to

1217
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Just technology

1218
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
And

1219
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
His reaction was to

1220
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
Pull the plug on his own research project

1221
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,535
And for the rest of his life

1222
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
He became one of the leading critic

1223
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
Against chatbot

1224
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
Technology

1225
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Stay in Jenner

1226
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
And I think it's really powerful to Jax

1227
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
Suppose that a

1228
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
The story

1229
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Just shared

1230
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,383
Which tells us that there's there's more

1231
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,919
There's more to the picture than that

1232
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
That there are ways

1233
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
To use this

1234
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
Technology

1235
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
In a way that doesn't

1236
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,831
Insertive distance us

1237
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
But in a way that

1238
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Enables us to

1239
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
To be more

1240
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Wonderful weather

1241
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
Why don't we just leave it

1242
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Pleasantly

1243
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,423
Gypsum thanks to give way but if particular

1244
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,983
Particular thanks to give to the person who made this whole
