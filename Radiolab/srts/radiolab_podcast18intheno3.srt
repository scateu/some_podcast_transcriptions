00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
Contains graphic language

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
And I just ripped

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,472
Pictures of sexual situations may not be suitable for all this

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
Are you awake

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,944
Listening to Radiolab

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,064
Radiolab WNYC

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,512
This is Radiolab and this is the third and final part of our Series in the know

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
About sex and consent

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
We started couple weeks ago

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
With some excerpts from a podcast called the heart

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
Chris by Kaitlin Prest and then last week had a

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Long

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,824
At times difficult conversation with education consultant Hannah Scotland

15
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
Heard it from some college-aged men in that episode today

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Yeah yeah

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040
Have you anyone make up their shoes get comfortable

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:00,672
We're going to start with some college-age women need to stretch you can like be like hey it's been too long like

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
We can do yoga

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
No

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
Cuz we ended up doing

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Zirmed

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Sway through the process of

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,192
Was gathering together a whole bunch of different groups of men and women college-age men and women

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Three different cities

26
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
I just asking him general questions about

27
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
How they're thinking about

28
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Are you excited

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
I ended up interviewing the man song I'll turn this part over to Becca wrestler and she boldly

30
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
How are you were with women

31
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Yes so the average group that we talked to was maybe a dozen women we try to make it as diverse as possible

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
You got coming

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Why did it have

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
The first thing that really struck us I think she would tell me if you agree is there was sort of a disconnect

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,032
On the one hand it seems like affirmative consent for almost everyone we talked to seem

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Like second nature

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,200
So I sent for high schoolers I'm going to even teaching classes on it

38
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
Yeah okay so you know like ch

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
So like a clear and concise yes at every step of sexual activity

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
I think that's like amazing that works

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,744
Teaching kids. Now and like I do feel like it's my Generations

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Problem 2

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Change it

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
And change the narrative about it

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
So a lot of them were really committed to actually changing the way consent

46
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,568
What's the way that these sexual experiences go and how their navigate it but then when we would

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
You know focusing on

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
What we were actually experiencing in their lives

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
What we saw was much different

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
My friend and I ended up in a bar like the bartender I was really

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
Lacuna really flirting and he like

52
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,464
I don't want to give any identifying information but we are just Levi bang and I like

53
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,608
What's up with him and then like immediately after I started hooking up with him I was like oh this is not what I want but like at that point of kind of like

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
Signal would be like much more of an uncomfortable situation and just like going through with this and like

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,104
Understanding I've already regretted kind of don't know why I didn't leave but eventually I was just fine

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Like whatever they please we come on please

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
But you know you're turned on a little bit like and I'll be like fine whatever like looks

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,112
Pilot asked me if I wanted sex when I said no

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:11,744
I'm actually like I just like kind of wanted to be like over with like the entire interaction and I was just uncomfortable

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
And I was like okay like let's have sex

61
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,352
Just because I thought that like that was the easier way to like

62
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
Make him happy make like get done with it and then like

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
It'd be over

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
We just heard a lot of stories

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
People having sex that they didn't want to have you know

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
Where maybe affirmative consent was in effect they did say yes

67
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:34,272
But it was either because the guy wear them down or they were way too concerned with how he was feeling

68
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
Like it would make him feel really really bad

69
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
I know that like

70
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,184
If you would have known how I felt that way he would have gone through with it

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
And like I just didn't want to like hurt his feelings and be like and make him feel like he like took advantage of me or whatever when I knew

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
That there would be no possible way that he would know that I was feeling that way some women told us that they say yes sometimes when they don't want to

73
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Because

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
They're scared heart of the sphere in

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,944
Sing hard no is the. Hard no can then be violated and that's like

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
That's like a terrifying thought like

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
To say like a hard no

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,440
But that's more traumatizing to me like in my head almost been having like a soft no just sort of like

79
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Sweat past

80
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
Having fear of future trauma

81
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
It's like having a fear of future trauma

82
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,471
You got to mean if your aim is to stay in control

83
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
And you feel like you might be out of control

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,175
Then the best way to still be in control is to convince yourself that you are cool with what's going on

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
I walked away

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Feeling like

87
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Many of the young women felt

88
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Frustrated both with

89
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
Their worlds but also with themselves

90
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
Yeah afterwards I would feel like

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Very disappointed in myself

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Cuz I feel like

93
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
How to compromise my own needs for other p

94
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
People that they would walk away from the situation and they would have

95
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Regretted

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,543
Wednesday maybe didn't actually want to do it but didn't

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Pick up for themselves and then I

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,455
And then you fight like a battle with yourself cuz it's like wait a minute like I'm like strong like I know I can like

99
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Just stopped are like white but it's

100
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
So hard I could like

101
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
In that moment to find like

102
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
I don't know like the

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,255
The words just to say it you know cuz then it is sometimes you just like yeah it is just easier just to be like let it

104
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Like

105
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
Just like let him finish that's it like it was clear for

106
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,423
Most of these women that in the moment of these encounters

107
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,519
There was some conversation that needed to happen that was not happening

108
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,127
But then it there actually was this one young woman that we spoke to some people

109
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
I think a lot of people talk about consent as if it's like awkward and weird and like

110
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,295
She just said consent has really become

111
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Popularizing is really

112
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
Well advocated for by the BDSM community

113
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
Play something abbreviation abbreviations bondage discipline or domination sadism and masochism

114
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Because you constantly have to make sure that somebody is okay and be like this is broke

115
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Some Community has this figured out and then she started talking about her experience

116
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,735
Does that mean that abuse and community health

117
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Figured that out

118
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Hello

119
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
Oh yeah

120
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
It's like that B-52 bomber Buzz

121
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
Hope that sounds better

122
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,631
Okay High did it we did it

123
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
Did you feel like I always feel like after these technical snafus there's like a bonding that happens to it actually bought it two guys

124
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,919
Well I thought it was true thing that people suffering together feel bonded

125
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
One another

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Well there you go

127
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Who are you by the way

128
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
What are you doing

129
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
My name is Julie Finnell I am an associate

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:56,767
Professor of Sociology at gallaudet University and I've been studying the BDSM community

131
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Since about

132
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,191
2012 we called Julie because she is one of the things stick to say leading academics

133
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
When it comes to a BDSM community

134
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
And all the subcultures she has written

135
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
Papers she has done surveys

136
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
And she has done from the inside

137
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
Like me pretty much feel like we were sort of Born This Way

138
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,879
And it's really common to talk to a lot of kinky people who will tell you the same thing like

139
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719
I was five and fantasizing about tying up people genitalia

140
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Antioch

141
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
One of the things we heard from Julie

142
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
And we subsequently her this

143
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Also from a lot of academics we talked to after

144
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
Is it the whole consent conversation

145
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
In many ways

146
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,431
Grew out of BDSM a lot of people trace like the history of BDSM in the United States

147
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
To the Leatherman community

148
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
This is World War 2 era by the way

149
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,671
These gay men would hang out in biker clubs

150
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Bars

151
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,607
They would socialized they were really tight-knit Brotherhood over the Decades of Brotherhood grew into this much

152
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Bigger community

153
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
And then it really

154
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Loaded in the 80s

155
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
But

156
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
There's a problem

157
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
At the time

158
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
No one had ever really formally distinguish between

159
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,431
BDSM a package between willing participants

160
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
And violin

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,855
BDSM community that they were not insane

162
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Let's go we're not getting off on hurting

163
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Roll and Bowl playing on

164
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
Power this is Joe cashell he's in Sochi

165
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
Professor women's gender & sexuality studies at Yale

166
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Slogans to convince

167
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,215
Non kinky ball that what they were doing was not violent or from

168
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Volkswagen that came up with

169
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
Encinitas was safe

170
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Sane and consensual and

171
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
It really stuck

172
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Today you can find it on

173
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
T-shirt if any of any BDSM Community event or play Party parties that are organ

174
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Nised at

175
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Formal spaces

176
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
They're called dungeon

177
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,583
So getting back to Julie we asked her okay if it is true as that one woman said that the BDSM community

178
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
If it is true that they have figured something out

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
I had to do a better it will what is it

180
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Panda

181
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Show us a couple things first

182
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,895
Drinking to my way of thinking of incredibly risky very frowned upon in the BDSM world

183
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
That's what we call Edge player just like kind of the things that people do or you're like

184
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
Like a bad idea negotiating sex when both people are really really drunk with somebody that you never met before

185
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
I just really really risky

186
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
And speaking of that negotiation another thing that was an interesting contrast

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Between the

188
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Quote vanilla World in BDSM is that

189
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
When two people are negotiating

190
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Trying to figure out if they're going to get down

191
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
BDSM

192
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
That conversation is formalized and it's often public generally speaking most of what's happening is is out in the open

193
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Did you have people called

194
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
Consent monitor is it sometimes roam around these parties

195
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
Uncommon to be standing there negotiating with someone where your friend or their friends right next to them

196
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Laundering mixing safe

197
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
I'll ask her to zoom in on a specific

198
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Content cop

199
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
How does it usually go

200
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,679
People with different experiences levels are better and worse

201
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,751
Pacifically like let's say I was going to play with you

202
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Great Lakes

203
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
You're telling me you've never done anything like this

204
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Write 0

205
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Z-Ro so I like the knife top

206
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
Which is a way of

207
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,343
Describing the fact that I like to do things with knives onto people

208
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,463
Actual cutting a people or or Alexa threatening event or no

209
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
Dragon knives along people

210
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Is threatening with somebody like

211
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Playing with my Pinterest the thing I do to make it more interesting as I liked

212
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Pick up people's clothes off

213
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Okay

214
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
How to cut people

215
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
Are they are they like serrated

216
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
And it can be some of them have rough edges and some of them

217
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Don't and that's actually one of the questions that I would ask you

218
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
I would ask you if you

219
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
You maybe would be more interested in front of a poking type sensation or more of a

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,975
Scraping tight sensation based on just hearing that

221
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,095
I would select my knives accordingly that point cuz I separate knives for the president

222
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
And then I would

223
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
If I was going to cut your clothes off for example

224
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
I would ask you I would I would let you know

225
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
That there's

226
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
I'm pretty good at what I do but there's no way that I can guarantee you that

227
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:35,295
I won't cut something that you don't want me to so if possible it'd be great if you could take off

228
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,647
The thing that you wouldn't want me to cut right like a necklace or your socks or whatever

229
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:46,047
Okay and I also like when people going into my garden pretty experience of this but I definitely have accidentally cut people before so

230
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
So

231
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
You know I just need to let you know that

232
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
This is not a 100% guarantee of our

233
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Is that

234
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
Something that you absolutely cannot tolerate then

235
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
Then we probably can't go forward with this or if you say

236
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
Oh yeah I'm fine with it as long as it isn't on my arm cuz I don't want to show up for work that's a great like we'll all just rest

237
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Stretch what I do to not your arms

238
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
She said sometimes she'll even get a pen and make it

239
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Tiny little.

240
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
On all of the places the person

241
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Says are off-limits

242
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
Just so you can be super duper sure she's respecting their wishes

243
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
They're actually

244
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Hello everyone

245
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751

00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
Arioso Vanoss's new

Eros was

253
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Start at the front of the room

254
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
In a leather Kilt

255
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,447
These two leather straps across the chest now is everyone here familiar with consent

256
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Bass

257
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
All right good

258
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
Does anyone know the difference between consent and enthusiastic consent

259
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,711
One guy in back brace and a sort of a new thing I started coming up in a lot of Clubs

260
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
If there's a moment of hesitation in that person's brain

261
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
You should automatically be picking that up in Black

262
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Do you actually want to do this thing with me

263
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Generally within the first 10 seconds someone

264
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
They won't have sex with you

265
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,583
You're not going to convince someone otherwise younger but I'm going to wear them down

266
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
We're not technically pisses me off at a party nobody owes you anything

267
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
Everyone on board so far

268
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Menards

00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
He took everyone over to this table show them the toys

00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Different kinds of whips

272
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Floggers

273
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,391
We'll stick with the feather on the Enneagram

274
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
And then he and a woman named Bella

275
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
Who is in Black lingerie they walk over to the

276
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Giant

277
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
Cross looking thing in the corner of the room

278
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
She then leaves against it

279
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,239
So I currently have Bella with arms spread on st. Andrew's cross

280
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
Alexa is not that tall

281
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Now we already had our talk

282
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Hey what school I just met you

283
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Am I allowed to put my hand in your ass

284
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Shoulders your skin

285
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
Do you want to keep you close as is late or do you want to sort of slowly chondritis

286
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
As we play

287
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Get all your things because you don't know where they're at

288
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
They can tell you just want to be like this Bella has told me she does not want take anymore clothes off correct Bella

289
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,935
LLC has make a huge amount of pain so then we go with that Illinois

290
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
You want to warm them up

291
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
Don't go to the gym do you have your set right away

292
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Breakfast

293
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
You going to start of warm up the muscles I do light touching like hitting

294
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
Start slowly whipping your shoulders

295
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,927
I'm sorry I'm just observing waiting for their bodies or the tell me some notes when I do impact

296
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Their bodies might tell me something

297
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
A little heavy

298
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Is little bit of a startling in

299
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
So you two have scroll in

300
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
If the ass comes right back out right away that's saying

301
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Daddy hit me again

302
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
If this stays turtle in I've went a little hard I can come in and stay and again you're talking to me

303
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Be sexy

304
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
That's too much for you baby

305
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
Zack needs to go lighter

306
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Keep it sexy you don't have to say

307
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
Hey was that too hard you can tell they keep it in very sexy and see how it goes

308
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Staying engaged

309
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Is very important

310
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
You're in a space that's loud you can't f****** hear anything cuz I can't hear if she's moaning

311
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,143
I want to be able to get my ears in clothes say how they do

312
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Then I tried to sort of cadence

313
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Play around a little bit more

314
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
If I'm there I'm combining between using impact play and since play will go a little more in-depth once you guys are playing

315
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
A little bit

316
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
Elder on the room

317
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
Domino's spent the next hour sort of moving around the room

318
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
Helping people if they paired off with their whips their floggers

319
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Learn how to better read each other

320
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
And for a moment it felt like

321
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Oh

322
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
We should all be doing

323
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Maybe not

324
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Using whips and having sex in

325
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Public

326
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
Nothing but finding ways to help each other be explicit

327
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Communicative and

328
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Have a code

329
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
For what words mean

330
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:22,527
When we talk to college-age Men Women a lot of them were like we need a script we need something written down

331
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
Because one of the things that's been found in surveys

332
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Is it there's very little agreed-upon language for example of phrase like slow down when surveyed

333
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
Many college-aged women will tell you that means stop

334
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Many men will say

335
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Don't we just beats ghosts

336
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Slower

337
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Well in the BDSM world

338
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,847
They seem to have started some of the South

339
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
House rules say yellow men's

340
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Check-in or pause

341
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Red beans

342
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Stop

343
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
And if somebody says safe word that means that

344
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
You're calling for help from one of the people that surround

345
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,559
It all seems so clear and sensible

346
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,447
And dare I say uncomplicated but Julie was like

347
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Let me come back Julie rains

348
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
On

349
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
The parade

350
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
We were throwing

351
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
This is Kali calling from San Francisco Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan

352
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Foundation

353
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world more information about

354
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Sloan

355
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,047
At www.slha.org

356
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,167
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

357
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
And I'm here because I need your help

358
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,895
And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents

359
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Aunts and uncles teachers

360
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

361
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Williams

362
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
Basically I want to hear about this

363
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
Did you know did something

364
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
It just means you lean back and say

365
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Wow

366
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
How do they do that

367
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,119
Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you

368
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,031
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score

370
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Or maybe the kitchen mat

371
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
Music in the margin of their geometry

372
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
We're interested in the

373
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Specific moments where

374
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
Kid does something super smart

375
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

376
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
If you have a story

377
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Go to radiolab.org brilliance

378
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Record short audio message

379
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
And that's where you live. Org / brilliance

380
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Thank you so much

381
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
A Time Jaguar back

382
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
37 the know and

383
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
Julie was about to tell us Julie canal

384
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
That

385
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,999
Even in the BDSM world it's very clear rules and safe words like red and yellow

386
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Things go wrong a real problem with that yellow red situation is that in public people almost never end up using

387
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Red Liquors

388
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,287
What are the huge problems with the DSM subculture basically has is that

389
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
There's Mastiff

390
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
Massive social repercussions to calling read in a public place

391
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Musically

392
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Can we talk about this more

393
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
Started to sound a lot like what we

394
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
Heard from the college-aged women

395
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Cat saying no

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
Even when it's much worse by all of these rules and norms

397
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
He still be really hard

398
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
There's a cost

399
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
Are the worst situations that I ever personally found myself

400
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Was Iowa

401
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Girls tied up and suspended

402
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
And

403
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
So all of my feet are off the ground and I'm having a great time

404
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
I had negotiated ahead of time that there was to be

405
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
Nothing genital happen is very clear about that I was like nope

406
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
There's not there's not a thing

407
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
Then she says the person who she was playing with the tire up

408
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
Decided to try some genitals

409
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Stuff and

410
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
I was really caught in that moment

411
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Turn a very public place

412
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
I could yell red

413
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
But in that place

414
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
Yelling red means the whole scene has

415
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,591
Stop and I didn't want to seem to stop by like being tied up and I'm also cognizant of the fact that

416
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
This guy is my friend I really like him

417
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Aaron's

418
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
I don't want him to get in a ton of trouble

419
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
What if I yell red really loudly in this public place

420
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
Pretty decent chance he's going to get banned from the event

421
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
It's pretty decent chance

422
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
You can get banned from

423
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
A lot of events

424
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Look at them in the face

425
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
He stopped

426
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
Cuz I was going to say you're tied up. That's very

427
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,031
The whole point is you're in a compromised situation

428
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,919
Even though she navigated that one fine in the end she says General Lee

429
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Speaking the BDSM Community is

430
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
Negotiation not

431
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
A Utopia

432
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
In fact what she experienced in that moment

433
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
Was for a long time

434
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Not uncommon

435
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
So I should explain that the scene actually got its own me-too movement about three months before the me-too movement hit like I didn't have that #b

436
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
Exactly the same thing happened where

437
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Bunch of high status people got out of

438
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
The consent violators on the scene

439
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
These are bunch of dudes or

440
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Yeah they're all men

441
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Definitely what I can sit violations that happened with women but people don't pay attention Sarah and I have a whole other rant about that but

442
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
A lot of attention on them where men and

443
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
Pretty much everyone that they had hurt with women

444
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
And that's part of the reason that Juliet is

445
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Any other little suspicious

446
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Of all of the rules that we were just

447
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Enamored of

448
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Or I should say she's a little suspicious

449
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Placing too much faith in those

450
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
It's not

451
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,472
About foolproof rightly so I may I definitely know people who

452
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,592
They don't want to tell you anymore that they're not having fun

453
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,944
So there's a real sense of like I don't want to disappoint this other person

454
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,112
It's the one of the things that I also will ask any types of negotiating my version of negotiation is like

455
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
You feel reasonably certain that

456
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Will be able to tell me

457
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
If you don't like what happened

458
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
The more I

459
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Thought about

460
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
That question

461
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,288
I got to read an interview tomorrow I have certain noodling on that at the creek me like what that's

462
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
A key question

463
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Can you say no when you need to

464
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
To some of us just a people pleaser

465
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
I am one of those people

466
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Hertz

467
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Tuseno

468
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Fino's coupon someone out

469
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Others have no problem with that

470
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
So she asks which kind of person are you right now it is situational who are you at this moment if they say yeah right now I'm not

471
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,888
Good with a nose and she goes One Direction if they say no I can tell you that I'm like alright can we both agree that we are

472
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Adults

473
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,240
That we don't have to get into all the stuff about what we don't want to have her

474
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,056
And that we will take responsibility for

475
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,176
Actually communicating how we're feeling in the situation and if we fail to communicate that

476
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
That we will also take responsibility for that

477
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
So are you okay with kind of whatever and you're going to tell me if you're not in the other person goes yeah

478
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
That's how I want that

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,560
Stop playing our conversation changes from what am I not allowed to do to what do you find hot

480
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
What is things that we kept running into

481
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Again and again

482
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
Was

483
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
This sentiment

484
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,568
That was maybe best captured by a guy that Becca and she missed

485
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
Michael lissack I'm the director of empowering victims

486
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
And I'm one of the people who came up with the concept for the week

487
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Concentra

488
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
That app

489
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,832
Was actually the one that a guy last episode

490
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,904
Search jokingly referred to hello would you

491
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
B

492
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,536
Can I record you on my cell phone if you saying you're down to make out right now

493
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Turns out it's actually real.

494
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Did this guy made

495
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,192
There's no really good the problem is that we've got a meme in the meme is already well established

496
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
Unfortunately

497
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
That means

498
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
Frames the entire question the wrong way

499
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,712
Sent means but you giving someone permission to do something to you

500
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
We don't

501
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
To sex to someone else

502
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
We have sex

503
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
With

504
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Someone else

505
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
Are you saying that that's the like dictionary definition of

506
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,768
Can send it interesting cuz I'm curious if this is just like

507
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
Aston Manor

508
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:41,472
Is giving someone permission to do something to you or on your behalf

509
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
Yeah I just looked it up and you're

510
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,688
Compliance in or approval of what is done or proposed by another

511
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
And Joe for Shell the academic that we heard from earlier

512
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Capture

513
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,416
Greece

514
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,768
Which is all of the sex was consensual but unhappy and unpleasant than unwanted

515
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
People typically women

516
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Indoor

517
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Curry shoes

518
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
May not be non-compete

519
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
Batman or leveraging definition to power

520
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,080
Extract sex for women that don't want to be there

521
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Did you call at 9

522
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,888
I was a second day I went home with him and I wasn't really sure if I wanted to sleep with him and I was kind of going through the motions

523
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
And at one point he pulled away guess you could tell that I was like

524
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,288
Not entirely there and he's like you want to have sex

525
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,152
Say yes or no and he just stopped

526
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Entirely and we just like

527
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
And I remember being like

528
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Like relieved first and

529
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Like really

530
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,696
Surprised because he read my part like second date like read my body language respected me and like

531
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Didn't push
