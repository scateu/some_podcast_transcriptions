00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
Out in the open air is just stats like that

57
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Anyway I

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I was always

59
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Very intimate

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
What changed

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
Oh my God it was terrible it was what happened was

62
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,016
I was having this beautiful it was Springtime I was having a beautiful leg of lamb with some neighbors and

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
We might put it on the grill and

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
It was just a delicious beautiful dinner and I had

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Serve with add some ramps that I foraged in my moms

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
Yard by the way is just a wild onion

67
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
And so

68
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,728
So we had this delicious meal and then you know I went home and was going to sleep at like

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Midnight Life

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
A few hours later

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
And I just

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Felt weird I was like

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Something's wrong I feel like really

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Anxiously

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Like something's wrong with me

76
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,320
I went to the bathroom and I like look in the mirror and my face was like all weird looking and I was like

77
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,208
I kept the laying down be like I'll just sleep it off whatever it is but everytime I lay down I feel like I was going to faint so I was like

78
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Prop myself up and I was

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560

80
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
Stomach cramps just like a weird feeling of

00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
Impending doom you know but just like anybody

Maybe a

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Now

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Tiny snail was on one of the ramps

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
That I ate

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
And it was like poisoning me somehow

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
You know snails I mean

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
They probably put

92
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Poisonous

93
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
So

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,327
I called my friends in the morning I was like hey how you guys doing how was dinner

95
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351

I was like wow I really had a rough night

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
And but I didn't think anything up and then I went on with my life you know just like whatever

101
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
And then about a week or two later I made

102
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Some

103
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Cheeseburger

00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Goodbye mr. chips

108
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,375
Really tear-jerking movie and a good book tattoo

109
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
About a couple hours after I ate I was like started to feel really weird again I was like feeling like I was like

110
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,175
Stand up I was like I think I'm going to faint I feel really light-headed I can't catch my breath I feel like

111
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,063
Really woozy but if any time I lay down I really felt like I was going to say it so I was like trying to say

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Sitting up right now so I can

113
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
I got this is very similar I've ran into the bathroom and I was like looking in the mirror and Loans all that hives all over me

114
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
My stomach and

115
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,607
Then they started coming out of my hands and I was like oh my God something's happening

116
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,703
And at one point I did get up and unlock my door because I did feel like

117
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
I have passed out

118
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,823
Con ambulance and then I could be able to get in so I mean I was

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
A little bit

120
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Ephrata.

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,247
And when I woke up in the morning the first thing I did was Google

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Sudden meat allergy

123
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Sounds like this seems like an allergy and the only thing that was a

124
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
The same was me

125
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,255
And I'm going through like the second thing that came up was this article that was like

126
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Florida man

127
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
Pasta and meat allergy I was like oh my God I think it's a possible I could have this and so I made an appointment with my doctor

128
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,519
Write an article and like I had to be this person but I can do it

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Had the article my pocket

130
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
You know the person who goes there doctor was something I found on the internet so I brought the

131
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
The article

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
It was in my pocket and Mike

133
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
I got to the whole like check up

134
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,231
I was checking out went when I was paying the receptionist I pulled it out and gave it to the receptionist

135
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
And I was like

136
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Could you kisses to the doctor

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
So

138
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
That was

139
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
The best I could do and then I did

140
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,263
Call my doctor and had a conversation with him on the phone asking him if I could

141
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Tessa news like now there's no such thing as a meat allergy Baba

142
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
Some people think allergies are just like

143
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
In your head

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,575
This is science writer Peter Smith we got in touch with him after we heard Amy story

145
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
Because Peter is an investigator many things including

146
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Strange allergy

147
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
And people are like

148
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Mushrooms hurt them or they think WiFi hurts them

149
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
When I got into the studio and we talkin about Amy story

150
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
You said

151
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
All right

152
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Exactly

153
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Who you need to

154
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Yeah High

155
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Thomas platts-mills

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Genesis Thomas

157
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Plattsmouth that's right

158
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
How are you I'm very well

159
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,831
Doctor platts-mills is down at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville he's a professor and he

160
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
Allergy clinic with constantly shifting through stories which not only you don't believe

161
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
But I actually nonsense

162
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
And he told us in the last

163
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
10 years or so

164
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
So he started hearing lots of stories

165
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Just liking

166
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
Somebody shows up at the office convinced that they're allergic

167
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
All of a sudden for no apparent

168
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
To read me the first time I heard it

169
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
Was probably as early as 2000

170
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
And every single time he heard

171
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
You would tell the patient

172
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Exactly what they mean

173
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
I told her no no way

174
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
No no no it's not possible

175
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Right

176
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
So what was wrong with these complaints

177
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Orthodox Medical

178
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Oh everything I don't

179
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
Don't become allergic to something they've eaten for

180
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
40 years

181
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,055
Out of the blue and suddenly not read me this page

182
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
I think you must be making this up

183
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Because I can

184
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
I don't I don't use language like that

185
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,319
I said I say that bad that I was I was trying to give you your energy

186
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
So you don't want to know what

187
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
Doctors are thinking in the invoices and are you often think in the middle of interview is it possible but he's gay

188
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Got you know some

189
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Goslee disease

190
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,167
When is the when he hear a story like Amy's

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
He just didn't believe

192
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
But then

193
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Everything change

194
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Thanks

195
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
This new cancer drug called cetuximab

196
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
In New York

197
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Today Martha Stewart was in

198
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Indicted on Criminal

199
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
This is the very drug that got Martha

200
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Stuart in all that trouble for insider trading

201
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Remember that I went to jail for 6 months

202
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Anyway very promising

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Exciting new drug

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
But then

205
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
Doctors were giving people this injection

206
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
And

207
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
And just like end up on the floor of the doctor's office

208
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
In shock

209
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Yeah that would be an anaphylactic shock

210
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
Their hearts would start beating faster that get shorter

211
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Breath and get stomach cramps

212
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,247
Their immune system would start to overreact to something new and alien

213
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Came in with the drug

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Basically a classic

215
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Allergic

216
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
So

217
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Dentistry lands on Thomas platts-mills desk

218
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:39,327
Yes so we were honest to look at cetuximab to see if they could figure out what was causing it

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
And it has two groups of blood

220
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
A control sample and then people that have this allergy

221
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
Any quick easy rodian on a particular molecule

222
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
It was part of the drug

223
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
This sugar

224
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Galactose Alpha 1 3 galactose

225
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
Alpha gal Alpha gal

226
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
As in a

227
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Particularly great lady

228
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:06,975
Better than the beta or gamma gamma alpha male to female didn't quite have a ring to it

229
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Anyway

230
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
It seemed like alpha-gal was the Copa

231
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
Yeah and if you told me four years earlier

232
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,471
That there's a whole lot of people out there who are allergic

233
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
To this sugar

234
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
I'd have thought you would

235
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Smoking

236
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,943
You know vaping again because not only does this sugar alpha-gal show up in the cancer drug

237
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
This is where you get back to Amy

238
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
It also shows up in the blood of mammals

239
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
All non-primate mammals

240
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,815
So every time you eat lamb or beef goat

241
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Camel even try

242
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
4pics kidneys

243
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
You're also eating alpha-gal

244
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
Some reading this article and it says like

245
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,407
This thing called Alpha the lactase are alpha-gal or what

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,759
Don't make no sense that someone like Amy who been eating meat all her life

247
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
Allergic

248
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
I just was like this was so stupid also

249
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
It's getting to be BBQ season I usually have like

250
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Couple of barbecue soraida

251
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Just do a whole

252
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Parkplatz

253
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
And the brisket and likes hang out all day doing it and I was

254
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
Chuck Berry wanted to do that

255
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
And I was like

256
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,359
Not eat meat and not even know so I was like forget it my doctor will test me I'm going to

257
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
That's myself

258
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,991
So I was like going to be very careful I got a thing of Benadryl

259
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
And I was like I'm not going to do it alone I'll do it with my mom

260
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,487
I went up to my mom's and she's like really into food too so she was

261
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,351
Exciting I got to porterhouse steaks and salad

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,727
Explain to her what you adjusting yeah I did cuz I had talked a little bit about it with her

263
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
So

264
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,407
Fire up the grill do the porterhouse I even think I'd like Instagram that has a joke like hahaha

265
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,015
This might be the last time you hear from me but

266
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
So

267
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
You know we're having a nice summer day just me and my mom having our stake I only ate like a couple bites cuz I

268
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Slightly nervous and

269
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
I was like sitting in the grass with my dog and reading a book and trying to think like do I feel normal

270
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Try it folks

271
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Hard

272
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
To figure out yourself

273
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
Do I feel normal

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Does this

275
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Am I breathing

276
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,759
Stomach hurts something wrong and I was like after why I was like

277
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
I feel

278
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Pretty good

279
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,647
And the neighbor came over and was like chatting with us and

280
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
It was in the middle of that conversation where I was like

281
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Kind of

282
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,607
Can I have to go to bathroom but maybe I just have to go the bathroom so I went to the bathroom while sitting there I was like

283
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Got something feels

284
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
And then I was like

285
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
I definitely

286
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
This is not right something's wrong and I went in

287
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,711
To get the Benadryl and I took two Benadryl and I won my bad and

288
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
And the guest room at my mom's house like sitting on there and I was like

289
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Be alright

290
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Maybe I just take a deep breath I'll just stand up

291
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Maybe I just put my hands over my head like this

292
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
Oh that does feel slightly better I think I think we should go to the hospital and I

293
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Went out

294
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Side eyes like Mom

295
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
I think you have to drive me to the hospital

296
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
Like talking to her neighbor like what oh my God how did it work

297
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Let me go change my clothes

298
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,991
Change my clothes like Mom you know she's not wearing the hospital level clothes

299
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,343
So am I okay hurry up Mom Mom are you ready mom and then I was like

300
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,743
Wash U change your clothes I suddenly was like oh my God got my wallet out of my cell phone and I flex through it towards my mom

301
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Bedroom door

302
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:58,399
And I was like my insurance card to call an ambulance and I just like hit the floor

303
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
Eventually the ambulance arrives and

304
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
I got stabilized I was strapped to the thing I was in the emergency room like they were

305
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,735
Shooting Me Fallout I don't know what epinephrine and adrenaline and

306
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,087
A little like 12 year olds emergency room doctor runs in and he was like

307
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
I looked it up on the internet alpha-gal fascinated what

308
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,047
I've never heard of that could be true yes it's true

309
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
When I went back to my doctor after that and I was like hey I just got out of the emergency room cuz they tested me for alpha-gal diamond

310
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Allergic to meat

311
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,407
So this is an allergy so all of a sudden you're looking at the

312
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Quote crazy

313
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,295
And they're not so quote crazy anymore I absolutely we suddenly had a blood test

314
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,439
And of course turned out is all these patients who been telling us this story

315
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
2

316
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Alpha-gal

317
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
But but is still like a mystery

318
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Right there

319
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Thomas platts-mills couldn't figure out

320
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
Why people like Amy who has lived for 40 years

321
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
Eating porterhouse steaks at Peter lugers with a credit

322
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Why would she suddenly develop an allergy

323
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
That is some kind of trigger

324
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Yes we were looking for

325
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Could explain it

326
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
It could be a mole that could be a nematode worm

327
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Or a fungus

328
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
But then he looked at

329
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,279
Again and noticed that all the people who have bad reactions to the cancer

330
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
They were in a particular area of the country

331
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
West Virginia North Carolina Southern Missouri has no cases in Salt Lake City no case

332
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
Denver smatterings down the West

333
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
So he turned to his technician J

334
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
I said you got a Google every map you can find and say what matches that are

335
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,647
Creatures or diseases that appear wherever the allergy appears

336
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Show Jake starts

337
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
Googling Googling Googling Googling and eventually

338
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
He comes across a map

339
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
That matches where the cases are very beautiful

340
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
The maximum area for Rocky Mountain

341
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
Spotted fever so he met this little map and it's like the

342
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,871
Shaded dark areas of the country are places with Rocky Mountain spotted fever and then there's like some Stars

343
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
I swear

344
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
This allergy had appeared yeah and they they overlap

345
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Very interesting

346
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
And then all the sudden

347
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
It clicks

348
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne disease

349
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,815
This is the distribution of a lone star tick

350
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
And actually just a little before this it turns out an allergist down in Australia

351
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
Carol Vance unit

352
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
The Noonan v i n n n n u n e end

353
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,455
And I'm from The Tick induced allergies research and Wellness Center in Sydney Australia

354
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,527
She said she was now being visited by all kinds of P

355
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
People who claim suddenly

356
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
To be allergic to meat and whenever I take a history so if example at Austin was their family history of brown eyes

357
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
The 6-month asthma

358
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
A stinging insect allergy nice a label being bitten by ticks

359
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
When we started asking patients

360
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
We suddenly heard the stories

361
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Just out

362
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Kazoo

363
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
But at this point Dr platts-mills all he has

364
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Is a map

365
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Some stories

366
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Anaheim

367
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Right so

368
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
So what does he do

369
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Well

370
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Maybe I'll just do this to myself

371
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
He does what he decides to test it on himself

372
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
Oh my God he's our like denies that he did it intentionally I know I had no intention me

373
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
I think you also likes to walk and amble and

374
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,191
Think about things right so he does for a long walk along the Blue Ridge

375
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Mountain man I knew I wanted to be off trial because

376
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,847
I'm actually rather allergic to humans

377
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,735
So he's walking and walking and walking along the way he bumps into a whole bunch of

378
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,063
And if you walk into a nest of those things only

379
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
If it sounds like a nightmare absolutely 200C ticks and then

380
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
In November that year I was taking out to dinner and lamb chops with particular deliciousness

381
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
The French wine was delicious

382
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
And 6 hours later I woke up covered in hives

383
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
He's got an allergy to red meat

384
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
All just because of a

385
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Tick by tick bite that's right

386
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
The bite you right back

387
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951

392
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,055
I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab

393
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
And I'm here because I need your help

394
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
And I request

395
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
For those of you who

396
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
We spend a lot of

397
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
What type of kits parents

398
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

399
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Tiny moment

400
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Brilliant

401
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Basically I want to hear about this

402
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
Did something

403
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
It just means you read back and say

404
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Well

405
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
How to make

406
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Maybe it was the moment that I

407
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back

408
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Do you

409
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

410
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,919
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

411
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Or maybe the kids in math class

412
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
You noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

413
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
We're interested in the

414
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
Epic moments where

415
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Kid does something super smart

416
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
But it doesn't have anything to do with it

417
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
If you have a story

418
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
T-shirt with us

419
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Go to radiolab.org

420
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Flash brilliance

421
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
And record

422
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Short audio

423
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
And that's radiolab.org

424
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Flash brilliance

425
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Thank you so much

426
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm Roberto which this is Radiolab now we go back to Amy

427
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,439
Just when she's discovered

428
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
That the allergy to meat that she's developed comes from

429
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
A tick bite

430
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Tick bite

431
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
Like a few weeks before all this started happening

432
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
As I said I was foraging for

433
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
Ramps my mom's backyard

434
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
And I had a tick

435
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,735
My on my arm no turns out that Not only was that tick bite

436
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Terrible thing for Amy

437
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
It was a kind of double chine

438
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,975
Amongst the trees

439
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,095
And I think it's only right at this point backup is it

440
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,911
And consider the story from Atticus point of view

441
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
Okay so I'm Grandpa clean

442
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
I'm a wildlife disease ecologist at the University of Tennessee

443
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
So I was wondering if you could help us

444
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Tell the story of

445
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
Lonestar

446
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Lipedema

447
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Oh yeah sure

448
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
So they start off

449
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
Little pile of eggs

450
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Perhaps a massive

451
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
2000 eggs

452
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Under the leaves

453
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
The proud mom just

454
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
At that point she's just a kind of a withered husk

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Mean that

456
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
Anyway few weeks later those pigs

457
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
And this massive 2000 baby ticks

458
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Emerge from underbelly

459
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Could I see them with my naked eye if you ran into a mass of them all up together

460
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Would feel like you got a little smudge of good

461
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
An image of Scott Walker

462
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,488
Climb up and potentially will be on the same leave for the same tweet

463
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Looking for something to feet

464
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,864
Now 110

465
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
Is that they dry out so when they come up from under the sea

466
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Steve's they come up briefly and then they go back down

467
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Come back up

468
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,896
Thirsty go back down and rehydrate

469
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
And we refer to the behaviorist Quest

470
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,344
So if you were one of these little baby ticks up questing for food while you're up there

471
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Yuan

472
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Century Velcro

473
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
Because each one of your little legs you have little kind of

474
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Like

475
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
Structures inside of your

476
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Flat against

477
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
Believe in the air with your two front legs

478
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Second attempt

479
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
CO2

480
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Heat movie

481
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
Let's say one day you're sitting there on your leaf and you pick

482
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
The scent of a nearby Mouse

483
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Potato chips vegan

484
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,968
Maybe you might be about to have your very first meal

485
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
So you best stand up

486
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,344
Stretch out all your little legs and do a tick.

487
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:55,744
So it's kind of interpretive dance why you waiting for that mounts to come just us enough

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Rabbit

489
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Suck your dancing your way

490
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
You're dancing in you

491
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
Reading

492
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
And you're dancing

493
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,216
And you're waiting

494
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
And you're

495
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Dancing

496
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
To be honest you are probably going to

497
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Wait your entire life

498
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
And die unfulfilled

499
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
Because

500
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
There are two thousand to be starting off

501
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
And a stable Tech population

502
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
Is Ernie going to be

503
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Two of you that survived

504
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Oh my gosh

505
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,840
So 1998 little baby ticks are born and then that's it

506
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Let's say that you're one of the lucky

507
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
And one sunny day there you are hanging up on your little leaf when

508
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
You detect

509
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
Two incoming mammals what is a 40 year old

510
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
The other is her daughter

511
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
Wave detector

512
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
And saved you waving your dancing and you're hoping and dancing in your opinion no waiting in your dancing in your home

513
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Grab

514
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Any

515
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
And survive

516
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
The reason that

517
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,312
Tech ended up on me

518
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Was

519
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
I slept in bed with my dog naked

520
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
I mean she's always make it but I was also thinking that's not gross I don't

521
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
That sound weird

522
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
But what button

523
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:30,720
How do you know that's when it happened because I know that like I did a good tick check on myself and I took a shower

524
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Power and everything

525
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
And then

526
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
In the middle of the night I woke up

527
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,448
What's up itching sensation and I went to the bathroom and I couldn't really see what was like

528
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
Something was on the back of my arm and it was a

529
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,336
Protec so as the tick is biting into a me

530
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,408
What is it giving Amy that's going to make your allergic

531
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,784
Two meatballs I need to stop to that Robert

532
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:02,208
That's Peter Smith and rejoining us is shoveled in the scientist.

533
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Circulation we don't really know

534
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
But here's a theory

535
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Normally when you eat a piece of meat you put alpha-gal in your stomach and your stomach digestion is in your body

536
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
But the tick cunningly drilling injects its saliva

537
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
A football that text that takes pit

538
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Into at the victims

539
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
Straight into its victim largest

540
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,040
Organ the skin and thick spit as an anti-clotting

541
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,416
Anesthetic anti-inflammatory compounds and we think the alpha-gal

542
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
That Peter says the thing about the skin

543
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
Is the skin is like this enormous like

544
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Surveillance

545
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
It's always on the look

546
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
Gottfried Invader so

547
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
Wind me up y'all comes

548
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Through your skin

549
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Covered by owner

550
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Bad bad ticks pits

551
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Stop that's going to really like

552
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Set off your means

553
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
Immune system

554
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
Freaks out like

555
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
The alpha-gal covered now in bad spit almost

556
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
Sort of by mistake

557
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Gets labeled bad

558
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
And now it's on the bad guy watch list

559
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,952
So before the next time you eat meat meat comes in and then

560
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,304
The body unleashes wave upon wave upon wave of chemical

561
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
Do battle against this

562
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
Alfred and his reaction gets way out of here

563
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
And you got so many antibodies both

564
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Making you

565
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
Aimee-ffion

566
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Right I mean

567
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
It's very weird that sounds like a science fiction movie

568
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
It sounds like

569
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,600
The beginning of a science-fiction at least

570
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Kidz Bop let's not go to movie but like

571
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
It's

572
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
It's just

573
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Strange

574
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
Which all goes to say this

575
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Really is

576
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
The kind of double tragedy

577
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
For Amy and

578
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Yeah cuz

579
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Xidan evolved

580
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Bite humans

581
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Right we're a mistake

582
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
Like we have opposable thumbs going to pull them off I actually woke my mom up and she helped get it off

583
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Play drop off the gun to drop off another

584
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Airport terminal

585
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,320
Walmart High pile shag carpet

586
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
End end the dirt

587
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
And for us while we lose something

588
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
That historically anyway is a big part of Who We Are

589
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Yeah

590
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Because we have

591
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
We we adapted in the

592
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Grand evolutionary

593
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Schema things

594
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Flash

595
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Yeah

596
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,104
I mean I'm actually sitting here picturing

597
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Steak

598
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
But actually the saying I mean hot dogs

599
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Like

600
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
Wrap ramps around a weenie in Rust

601
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
That's a good my mouth water

602
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Weenies weenies and ramps

603
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,048
Yeah but I am going my allergist tomorrow cuz I did

604
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
You know I was reading about this allergy a lot when I first got it and I read that for some people the allergy can fade away

605
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,568
So I'm going to get a blood test to see what my blood level of alpha-gal is

606
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
So I'm a little hoping for tomorrow

607
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
I want to be normal

608
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Again

609
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,928
That was the end of the Dan and Amy conversation she was going to go to the doctor

610
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Tested

611
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Find out whatever

612
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Define I would happen

613
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
So I actually did get an appointment with my allergist

614
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
Dr. Korn

615
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
Dr corn

616
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
She's really nice

617
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,992
So I got a plan I got the blood draw whatever and a few days later my doctor called me and she

618
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,064
Said that my numbers were still really high

619
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
And I was like wow

620
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
How high are they

621
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
And she was like

622
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
3

623
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,560
And I was like three that's not high and she's like they're supposed to be like 1 or something

624
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
So they had gone down

625
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
But they were still

626
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
You know many times more than they should be so when you left

627
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
And we're waiting for the call will you waiting with the hope

628
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
That what that you would soon be

629
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
Eating a bit of hot dog I mean honestly I was hoping

630
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,344
No no no I don't wish that you are you are the beat the great you you never knew I was afraid that she

631
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
He would be like oh my God your numbers are so low I think you could probably eat meat let's do a food challenge I'll be like

632
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Cuz like

633
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,584
That's such a scary memory

634
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
I don't

635
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
You know actually just the other

636
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:31,264
Night I was eating an Indian place and I was eating vegetarian but like

637
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,408
I felt something and I pulled it out and in the dim light of an Indian restaurant like why are they all it like that

638
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
I was like

639
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
Was this bacon

640
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,064
And I suddenly you know that you just get those drop in your stomach and I'm like

641
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
What time is it

642
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,952
4 hours from now if I did cuz it's there something about it being delayed

643
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
That makes it so difficult it just says like

644
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Make a suspense movie

645
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,424
With you it's like it could happen in the next 3 hours or maybe not I don't know

646
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,984
I mean honestly the only thing that

647
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
The real reason I want to be able to eat meat

648
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
It's so that I will be prepared

649
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
To eat at in case of emergency

650
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
I mean

651
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
I

652
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:18,112
When on a canoe trip in Adirondacks and I was like what what happens if I get stranded out here in like what if I have to

653
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,512
But I can't even eat meat out I have to hunt fish but then when the lake freezes over what would I eat I can't survive something

654
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Wrong with me

655
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,096
Byfield evolutionarily challenge

656
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,496
What is what I think about before I go to bed every night when I be able to survive if I had just what's on me right now a pen

657
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Underwear

658
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
My daughter

659
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
And so yeah I mean that's a real issue is like

660
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,712
That's not a real issue obviously it's never going to happen in live in Brooklyn but

661
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,808
I do for some reason I always think like

662
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
I want to be prepared in case

663
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
But

664
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Yeah you know

665
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,280
I don't think I would go back to eating meat necessarily

666
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Like you are still more

667
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Morphe

668
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Frightened and game

669
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
How to speak

670
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Well

671
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Also like

672
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
I wish I could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons because it's

673
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,200
Not so much just eating me but just like you know the the factory farming and I kind of stuff so

674
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,296
I feel like morally Superior now I can be like why I don't eat red meat

675
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
Course I'm forcing not even put at the same time

676
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:28,000
I would if I had the if I had the willpower I probably go that way anyway and then also

677
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,608
I think it's great it's like we're all evolving to be on this planet which is

678
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,400
Getting harder to be Anand

679
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
We know that

680
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Meat takes a lot of resources and like

681
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,128
Now I don't know I'm not doing that so like the tickets helping me evolve into a better human being

682
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Xo1 could

683
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Instead of thinking of the tick

684
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
As

685
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
Your teeny weeny

686
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
Irritating enemy

687
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,952
You can think of it as a Guiding Light

688
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
Making the world safe for to share

689
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
With your followers

690
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
So you may have lost a relationship with me

691
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
But

692
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
At least you have your moral superiority

693
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
Yeah I mean

694
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
I am Superior

695
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368

733
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
