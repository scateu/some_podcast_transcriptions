63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
This is story about

64
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
The weirdest

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Creativity in a piece of music

66
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Did Frankie add study in school

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
But which

68
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Unites

69
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Two people across space and time in a really bizarre way

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
Kind of rhyme

71
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,368
First Story begins in the 1980s in Vancouver British Columbia with a woman named and Adams

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Who by all accounts was a brilliant cell biology

73
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
Oh yes and was highly articulate

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,607
That's her husband Robert Adams you know extremely capable with language

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
She did cancer research he actually develop the cell line

76
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
That I believe still exist

77
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
So she was very sharp

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
He says that as a scientist she was a natural but then

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Rather Suddenly at the age of 46

80
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
And kind of did a 180

81
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
Something happened in 86 which change the course of her life

82
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,183
It all started when their third son Alex gets into a really bad car accident

83
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
We were told that he would probably never ever walk again

84
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,887
And decided she's going to take some time off to help him recover and he does he does learn to walk again

85
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
The wild home

86
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
She just decides to quit

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Quit science

88
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
And become a painter

89
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Dan

90
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Made up her mind then and there

91
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
That she was going to

92
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Take apart

93
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Full-time

94
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,063
Had she ever painted for well she did a fair amount of it when she was in high school

95
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
Which is a very long time ago so the whole thing struck him is kind of out of the blue but he rolled with it and

96
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,303
Within a short. Of time she converted a room in their house into a studio and she

97
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Painting houses

98
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
And buildings

99
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Little churches

100
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Simple at first but after that brightly colored versions of what you see when you look down the barrel

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,639
A microscope Neo cells bacteria after that strawberries

102
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,247
A series of paintings involving these Blazing Red strawberries

103
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
A water faucet

104
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
A note of what would becoming a stream of strawberries

105
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Play there was things called strawberry Universe where the strawberries have rings around them like Saturn and I don't

106
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,071
I think there was something like 35 or 36

107
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Strawberry painting

108
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
But then she would switch to something else even after their son had fully recovered even through Waze crutches

109
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Went back to school

110
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
And kept on painting and she would work

111
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
All day long

112
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,247
10 hours a day making these paintings that got bigger and bigger and more abstract and there were times he says

113
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
When he was like

114
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
Wow

115
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
Because for someone who hadn't painted since high school

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
She was suddenly so prolific

117
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
And it's entirely possible

118
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
There's something was happening to her even then

119
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,495
Way below the surface I mean on the surface she was painting it was working

120
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,103
People buying the painting she's having solo shows she was becoming a successful artist

121
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
Then in 1994

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
She decided I don't know what gave her this idea

123
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
I never knew what gave her any of her ideas

124
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
But time she decided she was going to do a painting

125
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Well

126
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Best

127
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Valero

128
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Bolero

129
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Yeah bowlero

130
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
Robert says he's not quite sure how it happened but it's

131
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
Some point that year and heard this famous piece by Maurice Ravel

132
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Became

133
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Set

134
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Couldn't stop listening to it

135
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Then playing it on the piano

136
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
Deconstructing it mapping every pitch in the melody in the bass

137
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
To color yours

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Here's one page

139
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,671
It's just very long just have her notes she's got a silver a flat copper

140
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
B

141
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Leaf Green

142
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
B flat

143
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Metallic

144
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Green eventually the paintings

145
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,863
Quite a large work to panel side by side

146
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,191
Barry Electric colors a blizzard

147
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Symbols

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Triangles

149
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
Tooth type things with marks on the middle mean something and rectangles marching back and forth across the first pen

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,991
There was a triangle in the bottom of each one of the rectangle and the

151
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Height of the rectangle

152
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Represented the loudness

153
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,671
It's an incredibly obsessive translation of the music into

154
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
Visual language and just like the melody in Bolero

155
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
The symbols repeat

156
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
And repeat

157
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Repeat

158
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Obsessively getting bigger and bigger and bigger until at the very end of the second panel

159
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,335
Things unravel

160
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Was unraveling

161
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Bolero

162
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
And that unraveling

163
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
Turns out it happened before we come back we're going to mm

164
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
Explain what we mean by a rhyme

165
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Don't have to explain it it'll just

166
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Run

167
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559

Professor music at the Aaron Copland School of Music

201
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
It's called

202
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
He's written about Ravel

203
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Perform Ravel

Talk to anyone who ever knew Ravel

What should I say kind of a living presence inside my head

206
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
2ok Maurice Ravel

207
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Composer obviously one of the greats

208
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Born in 18

209
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
95

210
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Papa was an engineer

211
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Mother was

212
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
I'm an old boss

213
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Family

214
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
I sent you in Spanish

215
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Yes

216
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Which is why I asked

217
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
This music like Bellaire does sound of it Spanish encourage them to study music

218
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Andy's Meats

219
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,815
Claude Debussy and together they sort of invent this style of music which we now call impressionism

220
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Kind of

221
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
Free-floating

222
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
Almost dreamlike sensuous

223
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
A lot of colors

224
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
Very flowery

225
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
Then like an

226
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
Revell makes a kind of s***

227
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,343
1928 West absolutely

228
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Phenomenal

229
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Just for the United States

230
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Form for thousands is that the Zenith of his creativity and he's back in France at a beach house wearing a pink

231
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Bathing suit

232
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
Story goes right before he steps out onto the beach this melody

233
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Slips into his head

234
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Runs over the piano Texas index finger when he goes

235
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Duh duh Dunt Dunt Dunt Dunt

236
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Are there it was

237
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Just came to him fully formed

238
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
Well he I don't know if he played the whole Melody

239
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
But he's at least started

240
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
It Off

241
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
But here's the shift when he sat down to flush the whole thing out instead of developing a Melody making it super flowery likes other stuff

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Decide now

243
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
I'm not going to that

244
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm going to take this melody and repeat it

245
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Again and again and again

246
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
And it's Amore never changes OneNote

247
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
The only thing that does change is the orchestration which grows around the melody

248
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Very slowly

249
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Bit by bit

250
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Gets bigger

251
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Big Bore company man

252
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
More instruments play the melody

253
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,303
Amelia self for 340 bars

254
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Never

255
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Berries to the point he says where the performers

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,311
Ready to see a psychiatrist by the time they're done playing this piece

257
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
And without the first performance in Paris I'm woman screamed out

258
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
He's crazy

259
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Which turned out to be

260
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Not exactly true but in the neighborhood

261
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
6 years after he wrote bolero

262
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
1930s

263
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
Ravel begins to forget words

264
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
She always been forgetful so no one really noticed it first

265
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Then one day at dinner

266
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
Grab the knife by the wrong side he doesn't realize it

267
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
And continues to try to eat holding

268
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
The chop side of the knife and trying to cut with the handle

269
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Then visit a friend leaves

270
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
Not 2 hours go by knock on the door it's Rahzel again

271
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
He didn't remember

272
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
That he'd been there before

273
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,927
Just two hours earlier eventually he could not write anymore

274
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Speak

275
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Is language at evaporator

276
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,375
Darby says there are documents Regency Ravel desperately trying to relearn the alphabet

277
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
A

278
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
A

279
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
A over and over

280
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
Well be

281
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
The

282
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Kind of a shaking

283
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
And very small

284
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Very very painful

285
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
Whatever it was that was wrong

286
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Was getting worse

287
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,071
Use the word symmetry just like Ravel 6 years after finishing her Bolero by mm I would say

288
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
And

289
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Also begin to forget

290
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
She would try to say things

291
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
And couldn't

292
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,263
She would try to find words and couldn't

293
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
So how are you today

294
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Find

295
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,479
Eventually and ends up at the University of California San Francisco

296
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,855
And this was in 2002 and they gave her a bunch of tests can you tell me your your full name please

297
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
Anne Teresa Adams

298
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
This video one of these tests and innate you can see and sitting at a table

299
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Black sweater

300
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Gray hair glasses

301
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Very composed you tell me your address

302
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
Like someone who's used to knowing the answers

303
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Questions

304
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
B blaster

305
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
4

306
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
23

307
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Which town

308
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Which town Vancouver

309
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,679
By the time and had come to see us her communication abilities were

310
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Markedly diminished

311
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,823
That's dr. Bruce Miller neurologist he runs the memory and aging Center at UCSF

312
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,455
Example we asked her to describe

313
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
A very complex rich

314
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Picture with take your time

315
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,927
Children with a kite with a sailboat on the ocean and please tell me what you see

316
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
And if you can please try to speak in sentences

317
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,631
And would it be able to say single words with no grammar she'd go

318
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Sailboat

319
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Tree

320
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
Boy

321
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
Water people

322
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,967
Kitekite flag

323
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
And that

324
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,343
Four five words would come out over about a minute's time

325
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
She was very frustrated

326
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,815
Does an atom's in Maurice Ravel we're unraveling in the exact same way

327
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Exact same speed

328
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
To the same soundtrack you might say

329
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Just

330
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,823
Roughly 60 years apart we think he and Ann down to the very molecular process had the exact

331
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Same disease

332
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
Anything cebollero the music and then the painting

333
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
In both their case

334
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
What's the first symptom of AIDS

335
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
6 couple of steps to explain bear with me

336
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,695
Start the disease called frontotemporal dementia and

337
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,815
It's begins when certain cells in your frontal cortex which is your forehead

338
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Begin to wither away

339
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
In some cases literally leaving holes

340
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
In your frontal cortex and we know this about an

341
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
Some tests and brain scans we suspected about Ravel because Queen RV just before he died on December 28th

342
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,479
1937 French surgeon open up a skull

343
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
And saw that

344
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
One of the lobes of the

345
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
2 lobes of the brain

346
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Had sunk

347
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Disintegrate

348
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,023
Now in both of their cases the part of their brain part of their cortex got hit

349
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
What's on the left

350
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Is it part of the brain does a lot of things I had lodged with memory but most importantly for our story this is the part of your brain that

351
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Largely governs language

352
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
People who suffer from frontotemporal dementia

353
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
They lose

354
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
They can no longer string words together

355
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
And here's something about losing something like language

356
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
It has all kinds of other effects

357
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
In the brain because

358
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,255
Bruce you know our brain is a series of interconnected circuit

359
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
And when

360
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
In a normal brain a dominant circuit like language turns on

361
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
It is basically wired

362
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
To turn a bunch of other circuits off basically goes

363
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
Two other parts of the brain we have this constant Dancewear

364
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,991
1 circuit or many circuits turn on and then their obligatory really turning off other circuits

365
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,343
So language acts as a kind of brake on other things to bring Timmy doing

366
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Like daydreaming

367
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Taking a picture

368
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
But

369
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,255
When the language is no longer there to hold things back Austin

370
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
What happens if those other parts

371
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Let's say the visual part scan

372
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Rushford

373
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Suddenly the mind is just

374
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Flooded with images and you hear

375
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,639
Reports of people having these intensely visual experiences Express is very common

376
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
We see a number of patients would become visually obsessed he says he sees you no investment bankers who never shown any in

377
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Interest in are never

378
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Even walked into an art museum

379
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,719
All of a sudden they decide in their 50s well I'm going to move into a loft take up painting that's right

380
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
How many of these cases have you seen

381
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
56

382
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
Steal some of them has sculpted some of them

383
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
Painted he said he's seen people take up gardening graphic design

384
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,543
And what's so many of the cases have in common is that the sort of visual creativity that burst forth

385
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
It's not the free-flowing kind it's very mechanical

386
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
The repetition Obsession they get stuck in a kind of loop taking one visual ID and doing it again and again and it

387
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Again

388
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
Like an Anne Adams Painting

389
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Bolero

390
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
This said drive to repeat

391
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Happens very early in the course of this illness

392
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Teresa

393
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
What can seem like a simple creative

394
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Choice to repeat a melody

395
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
May actually be driven by a condition

396
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,895
But you won't even know you have for six years we think that this had something to do with a very unusual

397
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
Rhythmic repetitive sorts of music that

398
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Revell produce

399
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,599
I asked Bruce so why the repetition where does

400
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
Where does that come from

401
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,487
And I think this is a release of of

402
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
You said we don't really know

403
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
The effort of a theory which I find fascinating

404
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Which make it to the root of creative Obsession of any kind

405
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
He says there might be

406
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
Several parts of the brain that are held back by the language

407
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
With circuit and one of them

408
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Is this very ancient part of the brain

409
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
The basal ganglia the part of the brain we move with

410
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,135
You can call a reptile brain is the part of us that governs basic Behavior

411
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Eating running

412
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Motor programs that we do repetitively everyday

413
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,143
Eat run run birds and snakes

414
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Get by with

415
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
Basically just this part of the brain

416
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Keep them alive

417
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
Normally he thinks the language part of us

418
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
Inhibits these habits these repetitive motor

419
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Programs

420
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,015
When the language part of the brain is not there to do the shushing these motor commands filter up to

421
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
So imagine you're one of these people your mind is

422
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Flooded with all of the

423
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
These images may be sound

424
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Also flooded with all of these

425
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Kinetic repetitive instructions move

426
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
Move move do it again in the early stages of the illness

427
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
You still have enough brain to make sense of it all

428
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,752
There's still a lot of Cortex that is still available to

429
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
Act upon this desire to repeat

430
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
So you get art that is obsessive and repetitive but also beautiful

431
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
An abstract

432
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Like

433
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
And painting unraveling bolero

434
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,880
But then resets as the disease progresses in more of that sort of Cortex a human apart

435
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,208
Hate the way the repetition becomes much simpler

436
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
In the latter stages of a disease he says you'll often see patients pouring water into a cup hundred times

437
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Open today

438
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Squishing apps over and over again

439
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
The complexity of the behaviors are diminishing as we're losing these are parts of the brain that make us so humid

440
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
This is sort of what you see in Anne's work her painting start off simple exploded abstraction and then get simple again

441
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
What's unusual compared to the other patients is that she kept painting almost all the way to the

442
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
Literally it was not possible for her to to hold and direct a pressure of pain

443
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:34,240
It's her husband Robert again and became progressively paralyzed on the right side of her body she lost

444
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
What's the ability to paint

445
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
2005

446
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
And that. Is that what she said

447
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
Towards the end he said he would go into her studio and I would see her there in front of a blank canvas

448
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,464
She wouldn't be doing anything

449
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
She would just be looking at it

450
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
And I come back

451
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Couple of hours later

452
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
And she still wouldn't have done anything

453
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,216
She had lost the ability to do the yard

454
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
Anatomy is one of the

455
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
I daresay beautiful parts of an story that the drive to create is as Primal as anything

456
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Else in the body that even after she couldn't eat after she could barely swallow she still sat there in

457
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
In her studio trying to paint she had gone downhill so far by that time

458
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
That time

459
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
That she was hardly recognizable us as herself

460
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
At some point in the disease and you can see that in this early tape painting was really all she had

461
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't have them memories of this

462
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:56,160
It's basically all she was

463
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
I do art

464
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
She died in 2007 in January of 2007

465
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Almost exactly 60 years

466
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
After Maurice Ravel

467
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,912
Text to Robert Adams Bruce Miller at the University of California San Francisco

468
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448

469

Queens College

470
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Well that's a song that's not that's that's

471
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
That's a pizza that's not good

472
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Stay the same

473
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
It's funny I used to think of Bolero is like a happy jaunty tune

474
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Now I'm like who it's

475
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
What kind of haunted it's an interesting sort of

476
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Paradox

477
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Assisting hands on

478
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
She sits in front of her canvas

479
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Ferociously stalls

480
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
We both know it's the ferocious beast

481
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
That that that creativity

482
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Consumer kind of restlessness

483
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
And the restlessness maybe one of the things I love

484
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Leaves last

485
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Nice picnic leaving we should go

486
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
