1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
Are you awake

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:10,752
Listening to Radiolab

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,616
Radio WNYC

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,808
I'm Jedi bomb run I'm Robert krulwich you know what this is is from

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,624
Okay so we can play you a little bit take first just

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
To set up there what we're going to do today

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
About a month ago we were doing the thing about

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
The fake news

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,328
Yeah we're worried worried about a lot of things a lot of people I but in the middle of doing that reporting we

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,608
We were talking with

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
I fell from Vanity Fair my name is Nick. And I'm a special correspondent for Vanity Fair in the course of our conversation

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,104
And this has nothing to do what we talked about by the way Nick just got into a sort of a

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,944
Well he wouldn't do a kind of a nervous reverie

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,016
I'd say he was like you know you guys want to talk about fake news

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
That's not actually with eating at me

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,624
The thing that I've been pretty obsessed with lately

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,744
Is actually not fake news but it's Automation and artificial intelligence and driverless cars

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Because

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
It's going to

20
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
A larger effect on society

21
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
Then any technology that has ever been created

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
History of mankind

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
I know it's kind of a bold statement but

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,848
But you got to imagine that you know

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,152
That there will be in the next

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
10 years

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
20 to 50 million jobs that were

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
Call to Spanish. Automation you know

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,392
Million truckers that will lose their jobs

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,000
They do but it's not we think about like automation drive us cars and we think about

31
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
The fact that

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
They are going to

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
The people that just drive the cars like the taxi drivers in the truck was going to lose their jobs what we don't realize is that there

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
Entire industries that are built around

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Just cars

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Sulfur example

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
If you are not driving the car

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Why do you need insurance

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Did the new parking ticket

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,576
Because your driver's car knows where I can and cannot park and goes and finds a spot and moves and so on

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
I'm if there truckers that are no longer using rest stops

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
Speakers drivers cars don't have to stop and pee or take a nap then

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
All of those little rest stops all across America who are affected people aren't stopping to use the restroom

44
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
Do not bind Burgers they're not staying in these hotels and so on and so forth then

45
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
And then

46
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
You look a driverless cars to next level

47
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
The whole concept of what a car is

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
What is going to change so for example right now

49
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
A car has 5 seats in a wheel

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
But if I'm not driving

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
What's the point of having five seats in a wheel you could imagine that you take different cars and maybe when I was on my way here too

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
To this interview

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,488
I wanted to work out so I called a driverless GM car

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,632
Or Ivan meeting out in Santa Monica after this and it's an hour or so I call a movie car to watch a movie on the way out there or

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Apus car

56
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,008
And I pick up someone else we have a meeting on the way and all of these things are going to happen

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Not in a vacuum but simultaneously this you know pizza delivery drivers going to be replaced by robots that will actually cook your pizza on the

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
The way to your house

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
In a little box and then deliver it

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
And so

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,344
Kind of a little bit of a along with an answer but I truly do think that

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
It's going to have a

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
A massive Mass Effect

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Society

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Am I stressing you guys out and you are you having heart palpitations over there, so that's a fairly

66
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
Compelling description of a of a

67
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Have a very dangerous future

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,544
But you know what it's funny one of the things that we couldn't use that tape

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,664
Initially at least but we kept thinking about it because it actually weirdly points us

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Back

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
To a story we did

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
About a decade ago

73
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
The story of a moral problem that's about to get

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
Totally reimagined it maybe the what Nick is worried about

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
And what we were worried about 10 years ago

76
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Anel coming dangerously close together

77
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,424
So what we thought we could do is weird we're going to play you the story as we did it then

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Sir the full segment

79
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,336
And then we're going to a minute on the back end and by way of Justice claiming this was at a moment in our

80
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Development

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Where there's just way too many sound effects just gratuitous

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Do much

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
And also like we we talked about the fmri machine like it's just like amazing penguin

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Was

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
Soda cam

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
We're getting late for you and then talk about it on the back end this we start

87
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
With a description of something called

88
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
The trolley problem

89
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Unison train track

90
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Go there in your mind

91
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
There are five workers

92
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
On the tracks work

93
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
It got their backs

94
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
Turn to the trolley Witch is coming in the distance

95
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Mina repairing the

96
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Unbeknownst

97
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
They don't see it

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
You can't shout to them okay and if you do nothing

99
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,863
Here's what'll happen

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
How did workers will die

101
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
I was a horrible experience I don't want that to happen again but you have a choice

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
You can do a

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Nothing or B

104
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
It so happens next to you is a lever

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,039
Pull the lever in the trolley will jump onto some sidetracks where there is only one person

106
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
So if

107
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,743
Charlie goes on the second check it will kill the one guy so there's your choice.

108
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Kill one man by pulling a lever

109
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Or do you kill five men

110
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
By doing

111
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Naturally

112
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Right here

113
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Part 2

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
You stand near some train tracks

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Five guys are in the tracks

116
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
4 and there is the trolley, right

117
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,855
Exactly how random a couple changes now you're standing on a foot

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
The past is over the tracks

119
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
You looking down

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Onto the tracks

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,511
No lever anywhere to be seen except next to you

122
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
There is a guy

123
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,423
Leaving is a guy a large guy large individual standing next to you on the bridge looking down with you over the tracks

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
You realize wait I can save those 5

125
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
If I push this man

126
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,199
Heels land on the track since

127
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,295
I'm not going to do that I'm not going to

128
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
Do the app that really you realize the math is the same

129
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
Email safe for people this way

130
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Yeah but this time I'm pushing the guy

131
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Insane

132
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
But here's the thing if you ask people these questions and we did starting with the first

133
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
Is it okay to kill one man to save 5 using a lever

134
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
9 out of 10 people will say but if you ask them is it okay to kill one

135
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Amanda Seyfried

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
By pushing the guy

137
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,759
9 out of 10 people will say

138
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Universal

139
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
And the thing is if you ask people why is it okay

140
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
To murder

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
That's what it is murder a man with a lever and

142
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Not okay to do with your hands

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
People don't really know

144
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
Pulling a lever to save the five

145
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
I know that feels better than

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Pushing a wine

147
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
We save the five

148
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
But I don't really know why so that's a good there's a good

149
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
Mohawk laundry Maria

150
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Hahaha

151
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
And yet having a moral sense is a unique and

152
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
Special human quality than maybe we

153
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,487
We pass to humans anyway you and me can sit at least inquire as to why this

154
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Happens

155
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
And I happen to meet somebody

156
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Who has a hunch

157
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
He's a young guy at Princeton University wild curly hair for the Mischief in his eye his name is Josh

158
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,943
And he spent the last two years trying to figure out where this inconsistency comes from

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
How do people make this judgment

160
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,575
Forget whether or not these judgments are right or wrong just what's going on in the brain

161
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,183
That makes people distinguish so naturally and intuitively between these two cases which

162
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
Actuarial point of view

163
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
AR

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Very very very similar

165
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Josh is by the way a philosopher and in Euro size

166
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
Scientist so this gives him special powers

167
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Cheers smoke a pipe

168
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Now why you have these differences

169
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Even though I would like to look

170
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Inside people's

171
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Heads

172
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
Because in our heads we may find Clues as to where these feelings of revulsion or acceptance come from

173
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
In our brains

174
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
I so we're here in the control room

175
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
We basically

176
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
Happens if the basement of Princeton

177
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
There was this song

178
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
Big circular thing

179
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
180000

180
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Hound

181
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Brain scan

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Say a funny story

183
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
You can't have any metal in

184
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Because the magnet

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Tell me this long with the questions we ask

186
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
People to make sure they can go in

187
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
You have a pacemaker if you ever worked with metal Bowl

188
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,623
Yeah cuz you have little flecks of metal in your eye

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
But you never even know where they are from having done metal working

190
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
And one of the questions is whether or not you wear a wig or anything like that

191
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,655
Because they often has metal wires and with that and there's this very nice woman who does brain research here who's Italian

192
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
She's asking to her subjects

193
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Over the phone

194
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
All all these freaking question

195
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,823
So I have this person over to dinner

196
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Unit study Brazil

197
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
A few weirdest questions This Woman's like

198
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Do you have a hairpiece

199
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
And

200
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,087
What does it have to do if I have herpes or not anyway

201
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
And she said yes yes you said you have a hair piece

202
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
But she at

203
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
Anyhow what Josh does it

204
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
Is he invite people into this room has them lie down in what is essentially a

205
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Cotton rollers

206
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
New rules been into the machine

207
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Their heads are brace

208
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Never done this

209
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Yep several times

210
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
I meant tells the story she tells him the same to a note Raleigh Tales you told before and then at the very instant

211
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
They decided whether I

212
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Lever weather right now

213
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
What's the man that insta

214
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
The scanners

215
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Snaps pictures

216
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Of their brain

217
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
And what he found in those pictures

218
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
Artlink he showed us some

219
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Okay

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
The picture that I'm looking at

221
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
It's a brain look like it's from the top down

222
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Is top-down instead of slice

223
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
You know like

224
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
In the first slide

225
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
You showed me was a human brain being asked

226
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
Would you pull the lever and the answering most kids with yes

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Little Pine

228
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
Peanut shape spots

229
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Yellow and this little guy right

230
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Here and these

231
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Two guys right

232
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Dreams being active in these

233
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Oddly enough whenever

234
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
People say yes

235
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
The labor question

236
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
The very same pattern lit up

237
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Danny showed me another

238
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,895
There's a side of Green saying no

239
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
The large man

240
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
And this pic

241
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Picture this one we're looking at

242
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
Hear this it was totally different constellations

243
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
This is the No No No crowd

244
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
I think this is part of the No No No Cry

245
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
So when people answer yes

246
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,839
Clever question there are there places in the brain which glow

247
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
Push the man then you get a completely different part of the brain by

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Even though the questions are

249
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Basically the same

250
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
What does that mean

251
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
What does Josh mean

252
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Ethereal

253
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Theory

254
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Proven but I think this is what I think you have it in

255
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
He suggests

256
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,783
That the human brain doesn't hum along with one big Unified

257
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Light system

258
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671
Define warring tribes

259
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
1edisource

260
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
Doing a logical sort of accounting kind of thing

261
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
You got one part of the brain that says

262
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
5 lies worse when life would it be better to say 5 vs 1 and that's the part that would blow when you answer yes

263
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
I pulled the lever

264
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
If this other part of the brain

265
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,991
Would you really really doesn't like personally killing another human being gets very upset

266
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,879
The Fatman Kate and shouts in effect understand it on that level it says

267
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:16,511
No no bad don't do no hooks

268
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Okay

269
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,631
Instead of having sitter if one system that just sort of turns out the answer and Bing

270
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,495
We have multiple systems they give different answers they duke it out and hopefully out of that competition

271
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Comes

272
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Morality

273
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
This is not a

274
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
Trivial discovery that you struggle to find right and wrong

275
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,367
Depending upon what part of your brain is shouting the loudest

276
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Play Bleachers Morales

277
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
You buy this

278
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Don't know

279
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
I've always

280
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,471
Hina suspected that a sense of right and wrong is mostly stuff

281
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Dipping your mom

282
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
And your dad

283
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
A dent from Experian

284
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Culturally

285
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
For the most part

286
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Joshua

287
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Kind of a radical in this room

288
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Biological

289
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Biological inherit from the Jeep Pass

290
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
The sense of right and wrong it's already in our brains

291
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
From the gecko before Mommy

292
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Are are primate answer

293
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Before we were

294
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Full-blown humans

295
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
How to intensely social lives

296
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
They have

297
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Social mechanism

298
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,215
That prevent them from doing all the nasty things that they might otherwise be in

299
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Didn't do it

300
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,591
And so deep in our brain we have what you might call Basic primate morality

301
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
And basic primate morality doesn't understand things like tax

302
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
But it doesn't understand things like pushing your body off of a cliff

303
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,415
So you're thinking them at the man on the bridge that I'm on the bridge next to the large man

304
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,535
And I have hundreds of thousands of years of training in my brain that says

305
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Don't

306
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Murder the light

307
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
We're at even if I'm thinking

308
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,215
If I murdered a large man I'm going to save five lives and only killed women

309
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
But there's something deeper damages don't

310
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Murdered Elijah

311
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
But that case I think it's a pretty easy case

312
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
Even though it's five versus one

313
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
In that case

314
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
These people just go with

315
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
What we might call the Inn

316
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Leadership

317
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
But there are other

318
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Matera temperature

319
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Unfortunately of describing an act of goodness

320
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
Ten Commandments for energy

321
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
But what's interesting is that we think of of basic human morality

322
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
As being handed down from on high

323
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
And it's probably better to say that it was handed Up From Below

324
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
That are most basic

325
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Core moral values

326
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
Are not the things that we humans

327
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Have invented

328
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,967
The things that we've actually inherited from other people the stuff that we humans have invented

329
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
Are the things that seem more peripheral and variable

330
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
Something as basic as

331
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Thou shalt not kill

332
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,743
Which made people think was handed down in tablet form from a Mountaintop

333
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
From God directly to humans nochimson ball

334
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
You're suggesting that hundreds of thousands of years of on-the-ground training have gotten our brains to think

335
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Don't kill your kitten

336
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,175
You know that should be your default response I mean certainly chimpanzees are

337
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Extremely violent and they do

338
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Kill each other

339
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
But they don't do it as matter of

340
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Of course

341
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
They so to speak after

342
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Have some contacts NC

343
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Friesen Ford

344
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Profound

345
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Moral position

346
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Maybe somehow embedded

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
In Braintree

348
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
And Josh thinks there are times when these different moral positions that we have embedded inside of us Ann Arbor

349
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Braids

350
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
When they can come into conflict

351
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
And in the original episode we went into One More Story

352
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
This one you might call the crying baby dilemma

353
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
The situation is somewhat similar to

354
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
The last episode of mash

355
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Familiar with

356
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
The way we talk.

357
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
It's wartime

358
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
You're hiding in the basement with some of your fellow villagers

359
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
Achilles life and the enemy soldiers are out

360
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
They have orders to

361
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Kill anyone that they fight

362
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
Nobody make a sound

363
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
So there you are you're huddled in the basement

364
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
All around you are enemy troops and you're holding your baby

365
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
Your baby with a cold

366
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
And you know that your baby could cost at any moment they hear your baby

367
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
They're going to find you and the baby and everyone else they're going to kill everybody

368
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
And the only way you can stop this from happening is cover the babies

369
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Do that babies going to smother and die

370
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
If you don't cover the baby's mouth

371
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
Soldiers going to fight everybody and everybody's going to be

372
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Including you including

373
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Can you have the choice

374
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Would you smother your own baby

375
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
To save the village

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Or would you like your baby

377
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Knowing the consequences

378
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
And this is a very tough Quest

379
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
People take

380
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
A long time to think about it

381
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
And some people say yes and some people say no

382
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
Children

383
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Blessing and a gift from God

384
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
And we do not do that

385
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Next children

386
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
I think I would

387
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
Put my baby to save everyone else and myself

388
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,295
No I would not kill the baby my baby I have the right

389
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
To terminate

390
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
The life I'd like to say that I would kill the baby but I don't know if I'd have the Inner Strength if it comes down to killing my own child

391
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Moon daughter my own son

392
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,863
Then I choose that was done in World War 2

393
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
When the Germans were coming around

394
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,471
It was a mother that had a baby that was crying and

395
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Better to be found she actually suffocated the baby but the other people live in

396
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
No you do not kill your baby

397
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
In the final mashup

398
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
The Korean woman whose character list

399
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Sluggishly

400
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
She killed it

401
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Oh my God

402
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Oh my God

403
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
Ridiculous

404
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,967
I just wanted to be quiet

405
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Baby

406
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
Darrell Davis

407
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
What Josh did

408
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Is he asked

409
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,119
People that question would you murder your own child

410
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
While they were

411
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
In the brain scan

412
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
And it just the moment when they were

413
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Trying to decide what they would do

414
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
He took pictures of

415
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Their brains

416
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
And what he saw

417
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
The contest

418
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Describe before

419
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
What's global

420
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
It was a whole world

421
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
War

422
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,279
That gang of accountants that part of the brain was busy calculating calculating the whole Village Podiatry

423
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
But the older and deeper inside

424
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Also

425
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
Kill the baby inside the dream was literally divided

426
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
Different tribes in the brain literally trying to shout each other out

427
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
And this is a different kind of contest in the world

428
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,111
We talked about before remember before when people were pushing a man off of a bridge

429
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Overwhelmingly their brains yellow

430
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
No no don't push the man

431
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
When people were pulling the lever over

432
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Here

433
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
I don't think really anybody win

434
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Who breaks

435
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
The time and they have to answer something right

436
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
A good Quest

437
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
And now

438
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
Is there a

439
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
You what happened

440
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,455
Is it just two cries that fight each other out or is there a judge

441
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Well that's an interesting question

442
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
And that's one of the things that were looking at

443
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
When you are in this moment

444
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Parts of your brain contest

445
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
There are two green reach of these two areas here

446
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
For the front

447
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,071
Right behind your eyebrows left and right that light up

448
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
And this is particular to us

449
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
He showed me a slide at Snow's sword

450
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Areas that are very highly developed in humans

451
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
So when we have a problem that we need to deliberate over

452
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
The light

453
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Front of the brain is above my eyebrows

454
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
Sort of yeah

455
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Right about there

456
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
And there's two of them one on the left and one on the right

457
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,207
And they are the things that monkeys don't have as much of that we have

458
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
Certainly these parts of the brain are more highly developed in

459
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
I'm looking at these two flashes of light at the

460
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
The front of a human brain

461
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,447
You could say we are looking at what makes us special

462
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
That's a fair statement

463
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
A human being wrestling with a problem

464
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
That's what that is

465
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Yeah we're supposed to emotional but there's also a set of a rational attempt to sort of sort through those emotion

466
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
Those are the cases that are showing more activity in that area

467
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
So in those cases when these

468
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Dots above our eyebrows

469
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,440
What are they doing what he doesn't know for sure

470
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
What he found

471
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Is in these

472
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Close contest

473
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
It's whenever those nodes

474
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Are very very Act

475
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
It appears

476
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
That the

477
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Calculating section of the brain

478
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Gets a bit of a boost

479
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
And the visceral inner chimp

480
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Section of the brain

481
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Is kind of muff

482
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
No

483
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
The people who chose to

484
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Kill their children

485
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,856
Who made what is essentially a logical decision over and over those

486
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Subject

487
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Had

488
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Writer glows in these two areas

489
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
And longer

490
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Glows in these

491
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Is Terraria so there is a definite Association

492
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Between these two dots above the eyebrow

493
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,472
And the power of the logical brain over the inner chamber of the viscera

494
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,824
Well you know that's the hypothesis was going to take a lot of more research disorder

495
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Tease apart

496
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,688
What these different parts of the brain are doing or if some of these are just sort of activated

497
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Incidental

498
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
Kind of way at me really don't know

499
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Dissolve

500
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
All very new

501
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,328
Okay so that was the story we put together many many many years ago about a decade ago

502
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
And at that point the whole idea of thinking of morality is

503
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Kind of purely a brain thing

504
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
It's relatively new

505
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
And certainly the idea philosophers working with fmri machines

506
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Super new

507
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
But now here we are 10 years later and some updates

508
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
Call Josh Green in the long long stream of times I assume now you have a 3-g

509
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Giraffes

510
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
To Bob's rats and children kids and we're close to adding a cat we talked to him again he has

511
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
Has started a family he's switch labs

512
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
From Princeton to Harvard

513
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,680
But that whole time that interim decade he has still been thinking

514
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,776
And working on the trolley problem do you ever write the story differently absolutely

515
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
For years he's been trying out different permutations of

516
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
The scenario on people like okay

517
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
Instead of pushing the guy off the bridge with your hands what if you did it but

518
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Not with your hair

519
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Still in one version we ask people about

520
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
Hitting a switch that opens a trap door on the Footbridge and drops

521
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
In one version of that place which is right next to the purse

522
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Another version of switches

523
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Far away

524
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:37,216
And in yet another version you're right next to the person and you don't push them off with your hands but you push them with a pole

525
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Who

526
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,056
And to cut to the chase what Josh is found

527
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,408
Is it the basic results that we talked about that's roughly held up

528
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Still the case that people would like

529
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
To save the most number of lives

530
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:54,112
But not if it means pushing somebody with their own hands or with a pole for that matter

531
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
There's something kinda interesting

532
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
He and others have found that there are two groups

533
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
There are more willing to push the guy off the bridge

534
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
They are Buddhist monks

535
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
And psychopath

536
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
I mean some people just

537
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,520
Don't care very much about hurting other people they don't have that kind of an emotional wreck

538
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
Response that would be the Psychopaths where's the Buddhist monks presumably

539
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
A really good at shushing there

540
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Inner chimpanzee called it

541
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,528
And just saying to themselves you know I'm aware that this is that

542
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
That killing somebody is a terrible thing to do

543
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
And I feel that but I recognize that this

544
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Is done for a noble reason

545
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
And therefore

546
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
It's it's it's okay

547
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,560
So there's all kinds of interesting things you can say about the trolley problem

548
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,144
As a thought experiment at the end of the day it's just that it's a thought experiment

549
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
What got us interested in revisiting it

550
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
Is that it seems like the thought experiment is about to get real

551
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
That's coming up right after the break

552
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
This is Amanda Darby

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Calling from Rockville Maryland

554
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144

560
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,088
I hate everybody Pat Walters here I'm a producer at Radiolab

561
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,208
And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show

562
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
And I request

563
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers

564
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
About what we're calling tiny moments

565
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,312
Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something

566
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid

567
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back

568
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Do you

569
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

570
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the kids in math class

571
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
I noticed their writing music in the margin of their geometry homework

572
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

573
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
It doesn't have anything to do with the test

574
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
If you have a story

575
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312

Thank you so much

580
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,448
Chad Robert Radiolab okay so where we left it at the trolley problem is about to get real

581
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Giselle Josh Green play

582
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,312
You know now as we're entering the age of self-driving cars

583
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,896
This is this is like the trolley problem now finally come to life

584
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
The future of the automobile is here

585
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:09,696
Autonomous vehicles gets here first self-driving Volvo would be offered to

586
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Customers

587
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,536
In 2021

588
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Where did the who this legislation is the first-of-its-kind focused on the car of the future that is more

589
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
Supercomputer on Wheels OKC self-driving cars unless you been

590
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
Living under a muffler they are coming

591
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,760
It's going to be a little bit of an adjustment for some of us

592
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
But what Josh men

593
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
What he said it's the trolley problem come to life

594
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
He's basically this

595
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Imagine this scenario

596
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Self driving car now

597
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:47,584
Is a headed towards a bunch of pedestrians in the road the only way to save them

598
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,960
Swerve out of the way but that will run the car into a concrete wall and it will kill the passenger in the car

599
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,848
. what should the car do should the car go straight and run over saying those five people or should it swervin and

600
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Until the one person

601
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
That

602
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,736
Suddenly is a real-world question

603
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Are people in the abstract

604
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,464
Like what theoretically should a car in this situation do

605
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,352
They're much more likely to say I think you should sacrifice one for the good of the many they should just try to do the most good

606
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Worldwide the most harm

607
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,496
So it's between one driver and five pedestrians logic review the driver

608
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Be selfless

609
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
I think I should kill the driver

610
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
But when you ask people

611
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
Forget the theory would you want to drive in a car

612
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
That would

613
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,112
Potentially sacrifice you to save the lives of more people in order to minimize the total amount of time to say no

614
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
No

615
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Absolutely not

616
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
That

617
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
Would you lie in it

618
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm not going I'm not going to buy a car

619
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Hell no

620
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
I wouldn't buy it for sure no

621
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
I sell it but I want buy it

622
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
So there's your problem

623
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
People would

624
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Sell a car

625
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
And an idea of moral reasoning

626
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
That they themselves wouldn't Buy

627
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
And last fall

628
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Inexact

629
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Mercedes-Benz

630
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
Face planted

631
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Right

632
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:24,608
Into the middle of this contradiction

633
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:29,216
Okay October 2016

634
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,616
Paris motor show you had something like a million people coming in over the course of a few days all the major car makers

635
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
Were there you can see the Ferrari GT.

636
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,832
Everybody was debuting their new cars

637
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
In the one of the big prisoners in this whole affair

638
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,768
Who's this guy in the future you'll have caused but you don't even have to have your hands on the steering wheel anymore

639
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,864
But maybe watch a movie on the head up display or maybe you wanted to get emails

640
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
That's really what we're striving for

641
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,776
Krista van Hugo a senior safety manager at Mercedes-Benz he was at the show

642
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,640
They're demonstrating a prototype of a car that gets herself Drive its way through traffic

643
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
Embassy class today for example

644
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
He's got a maximum of comfort

645
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,320
Support systems being stuck in traffic jam

646
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Of course of course

647
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,928
He's doing doesn't it doesn't even restore the show and it one of those energy

648
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
We don't have on

649
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
He was asked what would your

650
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Driverless car

651
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
Do any trolley problem type dilemma

652
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Or maybe you have to choose

653
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Second one

654
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
For many and he answered

655
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
Quote

656
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
You can say

657
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Eastside

658
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
If you know you can save one person

659
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Save that one for

660
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Is the one in the car

661
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:50,880
This is Michael Taylor corresponder for Car and Driver magazine he was the one that Christoph on Hugo said that to

662
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
If you know for sure that

663
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
One thing

664
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
Mondays can be prevented

665
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Impact your face primer

666
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
So when he said this to you

667
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,936
Streator Manor on check did it seem controversial at all in the moment

668
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,616
I mean all he's really doing is saying what's on people's minds which is that

669
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,688
Know who's going to buy a car

670
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
The chooses somebody else over them

671
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,832
Danielle he makes that comment Michael Prince it

672
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
A kerfuffle

673
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,744
Ensues Christoph Von

674
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Hugo from

675
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
Mercedes but then when you leave the questions you sound like a bit of a heel because you want to save yourself as opposed to The Pedestrian

676
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:40,544
Doesn't it ring go of like just privilege

677
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
It's you or pedestrian

678
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
And it's just you know I don't know anything about this pedestrians just you or pedestrian just a regular guy walking down the street

679
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
Everyone who's not in a Mercedes

680
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
There was this kind of

681
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
Uproar about that

682
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
How dare you drive be selfish you not make you selfish

683
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
And then he walked it back and he said no no what I mean is that

684
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Just the weed

685
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,912
With that we have a better chance of protecting the people in the car so we're going to protect them because they're easier to protect

686
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
But of course

687
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
Yeah there's always going to be trade-offs in that

688
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Does trade-offs could get really really

689
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
Tricky

690
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Insult

691
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
Because obviously these cars have sensors

692
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Sensors light

693
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
Cameras radar

694
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Lasers

695
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Ultrasonic sensors

696
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
This is Raj Rajkumar he's a professor at Carnegie Mellon time the GM CMU connect

697
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Autonomous driving collaborative research lab

698
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,680
He's one of the guys that is writing the code that will go inside GM's

699
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Driver

700
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
He says yeah

701
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Sensors at the moment on these cars

702
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Still evolving pretty basic

703
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,896
We are very happy today we can actually detect

704
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
A pedestrian

705
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:56,320
Can detect a bicyclist and motorcyclist different Vegas have different shapes sizes and colors that he says it won't be long before

706
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
4 lochmoor about

707
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:04,000
Woody's people are eventually they will be able to detect people of different sizes shapes and colors

708
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,608
Like oh that's a skinny person that's a small person tall person black person white person

709
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
That's a little boy that's a little girl

710
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
Super get the basic moral math

711
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,008
What is a car do if it has to decide how do I save this

712
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
This boy or this girl

713
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,592
What about two girls versus one boy in an adult

714
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
But a cat versus a dog

715
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
75 year old guy in a suit versus that

716
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Person over there who might be homeless

717
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
You can see where this is going

718
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
It's conceivable the cars will know our medical records

719
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
In back of the car show at that time cost

720
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:39,072
Call communication cabling Technologies in highly automated driving

721
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,144
80s guy basically said in a couple years the cars will be net

722
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Work that we talking to each other

723
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,776
Just imagine a scenario we're like cars are about to get into accidents in right at the decision point

724
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,408
They're like conferring will who do you have in your car me I got a seven-year-old walstra guy makes 8 figures how about you

725
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
How about full of kids kids have more years left you need to move will hold up I see that your kids come from poor neighborhood and have asked

726
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,160
So I don't know so you can visit by yourself or not

727
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Therapeutic paradox

728
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,816
We do not think that any programmer should be given this up measure

729
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
Burden of the siding

730
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Who supplies and who

731
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
I think these are

732
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
Very fundamental deeper

733
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
Issues that Society at 2

734
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Decided large

735
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,176
I don't think a programmer eating pizza and sipping Coke swimming

736
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
How does society decide

737
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Maine help me imagine that

738
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
I think it really has been able to feel your processor

739
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,160
Rice told us to things bass we need to have

740
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,232
First we need to get these Robo cars on the road get more experience

741
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
How they interact

742
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
With us human drivers and how we interact with them

743
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
There to be like industry-wide

744
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,728
Summit no one company is going to solve that

745
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
This is Bill Ford Jr

746
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
Of the Ford Company giving a speech in October 2016

747
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,248
Economic Club of DC and we have to have because he could you imagine if we had one algorithm and

748
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,320
Toyota had another in General Motors had another and mean it would be

749
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
Cuz like what if the Tibetan cars make one decision in the American cars make another we need to have a national discussion

750
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
On

751
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Ethics I think

752
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
Because

753
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
We've never had to think of these things but before birth

754
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
The cars will have the time and the ability

755
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
Who is this pasta

756
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,616
So far Germany is the only country that we know of

757
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,688
His tackle this head-on

758
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,528
One of the most significant points the ethics commission made

759
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
Autonomous and connected driving is an ethical imperative the government is released a code of ethics

760
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
It says

761
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Among other things self-driving cars

762
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Are forbidden

763
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:51,424
To discriminate between humans and almost anyway not on Race not on gender not on age nothing

764
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
These are shouldn't be programmed into the cars imagine

765
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,592
How are few classes being added

766
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
In the Geneva Convention if you were like what

767
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
Lee's Automotive

768
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
A globally accepted standard

769
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
How we get there

770
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
Globally accepted standard

771
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Is anyone's guess

772
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
And what it will look like

773
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Weather it'll be like a

774
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Coherent set of

775
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Rules

776
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Or like rice

777
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
With the kind of contradictions we see in our own brain

778
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
That also remains to be seen

779
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
One thing is clear

780
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
There are cars coming with her questions

781
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
I could never

782
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
Where's it going

783
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
DMV

784
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Oh my God

785
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:49,280
Okay we do need a caveat all this by saying that the moral dilemma were talking about in the case of

786
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,096
Driverless cars is going to be super rare

787
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
Mostly will probably happen

788
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Is that

789
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Like the

790
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Plane loads full of

791
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
People that died every

792
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Day

793
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
From car accidents

794
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Well that's just going to hit the floor until you have to balance

795
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Few cases

796
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,248
Where car might make a decision you don't like

797
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
Against the massive number of life's a

798
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
I was thinking actually a different thing I was thinking

799
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
Even though you dramatically bring down the

800
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
The

801
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304
The number of bad things that happened on rug

802
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,144
You dramatically bring down the collisions you dramatically bring down the mortality

803
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
You dramatically lower the number of people who are drunk coming home from a party and just Ram someone sideways

804
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
Isn't killing three of them and injuring two of them for the rest of their life

805
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Those kind of

806
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Do things go way down

807
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
But

808
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,784
They're the ones that remain are engineered

809
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Like they are calculated

810
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
Almost with Forsyth

811
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
So here's the

812
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
Mississippi nutrition website

813
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
Oh damn that's so sad that happen

814
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
But I got drunk and out of that maybe you should go to jail

815
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
But you mean the de Societe engineered this in that is a big difference

816
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
What is operatic and seems like the forces of Destiny

817
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,456
And the other seems mechanical and

818
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:16,064
Thought through meditated something dark about a premeditated

819
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
Expected death and I don't know what you do about that everybody's on the killers in the particular

820
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
Kiehl's dark is a little bit like when you know should you kill your own baby to say the village like any particular instance of that one child

821
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,984
But against the backdrop of the life saved it's just a tiny pinprick of Darkness

822
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
You know how humans are if you argue back

823
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,992
Yes a bunch of smartypants has concocted a mathematical formula which meant that some people had to die in here they are

824
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
Are there many fewer than before

825
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
A human being just like Josh would tell you

826
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,024
Would have a ruler of feeling out of anger and say how dare you engineer this in no no no no no

827
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,352
In that human being needs to meditate like the monks

828
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,936
Silence that feeling because the feeling in that case

829
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Just getting away yes or no

830
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,544
And that may be impossible unless you a monk

831
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
For God's sake

832
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,664
Civil right back where we started now

833
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
She said you have to think some people know this

834
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
