EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:07,168	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:25,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Do you do you just want to like lay out for us the chronology of your
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:27,136	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Obsession I think I feel comfort
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What's a dalliance I mean you just noticed
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:35,328	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Crumbling building and ran over to
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sticker can I mean I am
EDL	00:00:38,912	00:00:40,192	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm a contrarian
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm interested in alternative facts about science let's say
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Hey I'm Jared I'm rod
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:54,528	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm a back row which this is Radiolab
EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Talk to a science journalist named Dan ingber
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Who got us kind of Tangled Up
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:02,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	About something that we thought we knew about the world but ourselves
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:07,072	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Something beautiful as I recalled that we talked about a great links on the show
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:09,376	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Hello hello and said that conversation up
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,400	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	We're going to start
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Isaac Steele
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:14,752	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Pastor Claude Steele
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:18,080	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Eastern's Emeritus professor of psychology at Stanford University
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,616	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	We actually had him on the show
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Number of years ago sometimes I can't remember how many years ago is 2000
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:38,816	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	On the show back then was because he had done study in the mid-90s that just completely change the way that we thought
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	About
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,864	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The power of stereotype
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Well my mother was white my father was African American and they were very active in the Civil Rights Movement so you can imagine
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,848	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The erase was no distant or passing thing
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In our life
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Family for Claude growing up that was just
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Everyday dinner table
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yes exactly
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So the topic
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,600	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is so the family Birthright
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Then years and years later Midway through his career as a
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Psychology
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Claude ran into a demonstration of the power of race that
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Really surprised and I got a job offer this is in the 80s
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	University of Michigan and it was part psychology and part to administer a minority
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Student program there
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is Clydesdale the original program we ran back in 2009 and
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:26,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In the process I think I saw dated at surprise me
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What he saw was a
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,760	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Troubling trend
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Two kids would enter Michigan one was black one was white they come in
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Exact
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Same level same skills
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Same SAT score should do the same when they get to Michigan but
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Without fail
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Or almost
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I feel after one semester or I could was
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,680	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Winding up with lower grades how much lower
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Pretty pretty pretty dramatic
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	At least two-thirds of a letter grade in a black kid who should be getting an A2 is
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	He said getting a b
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Insignificant
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Also by the way saw this performance cap
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Between women and men
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	When it came to math to the same degrees degree in advanced math courses it was
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Comfortable
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,000	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I learned this is a national phenomenon
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	If I was to walk into Emma's any college class
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In the United States
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I have a very high probability of finding exactly that
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:27,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So I think it's important to put it in context of what was going on at the time this is Dan anger again and he says that that
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Japanese treatment between black and white students that clouded notice
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It was actually a huge topic of conversation at the time there's a lot of discussion of what to do about this evening cap
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The Familiar argument is well this has to do is systemic racism and systemic
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Differences in opportunities
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That play out
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Through
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	An individual life span
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That seems right
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's also daunting
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Because our we ever going to be like
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cure all of it
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Socioeconomic status in our own country
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But then
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In 1994
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Different and in many ways very dangerous idea was being tossed into this debate Charles Murray
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Co-author of the book The Belk
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	When the bell curve
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Came out the bell curve
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Intelligence and class structure in American Life
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Bell curve argued that one explanation for the treatment Gap among others was genetic
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	IQ Bass
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Of course
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's not
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,567	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But even though there is no scientific backing at all
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	For the idea of genetic differences like this
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The bell curve was still significant just because of the kinds of
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Conversations
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It was creating of the time the effect it had on researchers in this
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Well the bell curve is one point in a long history of that
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Kind of argument.
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The difference between groups really is rooted in genetics
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Let's just be frank and honest and if you really can't admit that
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Then you don't have the courage needed to be a real science
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That's a thumbnail way of describing this experience that I've have been confronted with
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	With that note
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This was obviously disturbing to Clyde first on a personal level in order to be a scientist are you
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You supposed to actually be open to the possibility that you and your
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Your family and your whole race
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Have some genetic
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Limitation but also because it was so weak
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Scientifically
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's been very difficult
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Colts impossible
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To produce anything like definitive data
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That the
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Between groups
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Genetic differences between christening and Michigan clearly wouldn't be explained by genetic differences
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It also didn't seem to him like it could be
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Explained
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,295	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Simply by their backgrounds or their opportunities
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Because you take what's a black and white kittens Michigan they both have extraordinary scores like
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know during the 98
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Percentile on the SAT
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So the background
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Between the two kids
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Whatever it is
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Has not resulted in
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In a difference to that moment in time
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So if going forward and taking a test
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The black kid gets a lower score or lower performance in a chorus of some sort
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	There's something must be happening
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Right there
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Right there
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Something must be happening in the moment
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	There was something
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	There
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,695	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That people didn't understand that we certainly
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So he figured he would start with the woman in math
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	He brought a bunch of a bunch of men
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Software documents in the laboratory one-at-a-time gave them a half an hour section of the graduate record exam
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Can you take if your a math major
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Very very difficult math
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And sure enough
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The women who had all the same credentials coming into the situation
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Perform dramatically worse than the man worse as a couple hundred points in an SAT test
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So Claude Steele. Alright
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Step 1 complete I've got a lab situation
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It resembles the real world good next step is to
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Tweak things a little bit see if I can mess around with it
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Normally in these situations
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Test givers got a white lab coat on and he brings in a big stack of cellophane wrap test
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Put the clock on the table that solve it's all like that's
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Intimidate almost anybody maybe that's what's happening
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What if I took away the
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Took away the coat and most importantly
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Right before the test I had the test giver instead of saying the normal I'm going to give you a test
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,447	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Protest thing maybe instead
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Say something like that
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Look you may have heard that women don't do as well as men on difficult standardized math test
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,895	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You may have heard that
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,711	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But that's not true for this particular to
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This particular
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,039	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Does not show gender
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Never has never will he wondered
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It may be saying that
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Simple sentence before giving the test
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Have an effect
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And sure enough
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I wouldn't be here if
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Their performance didn't go up in
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:07,935	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Go up to match that of the equally skilled man that performance Gap
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Vanish
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	She look at this
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So we raced and did it
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Very quickly the same company
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Experiment with African America
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They're the pretest disclaimer went like this
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That we use to study
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Problems
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And it is not diagnostic
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Pic of individual
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:24,831	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Intellectual
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Mobility in other words this
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is not a test of your intelligence I repeat not an IQ test so just do the best
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You can't with that simple disclaimer to start
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The black students
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And the white students
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,399	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	1 L equal
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Just recently
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Ryan Braun and Eric dated at you clever
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:52,735	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Treatment think there is a an IQ test which is nonverbal healthy Advanced Progressive matrices has
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Figures very abstract I got
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Lines crossing that you have to match
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This essentially pattern match diamonds with dots in them
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And so they could represent that test as it as it is an IQ test attraxion is the gold standard of IQ tests because it's cold
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Culture free no math there's no reading because it doesn't involve language or you can represent the exact same test
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	As a puzzle
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Meaning you can give an IQ test to watch a kids and the black students will perform worse but if you give that same test
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Lose the word test lose the word IQ just call it a puzzle to Black participants
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,319	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Suddenly
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Jump up and they're performing basically we got a reversal represented as a puzzle black before me as well as white
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Let Me Tell Ya that's all it takes
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Just change a few words
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotypes of powerful okay that makes sense
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Snapper in terms of understanding how this works
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Can you make this
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Tactile stimuli
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	If the stereotype
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Having all these effects is like a
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Like a little Gremlin that bites
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	When in the test-taking process is it actually like
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Do it stand up
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Whale
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What does seem to be clear from the data according to Erik day and Ryan Brown and Claude Steele is it the gremlin
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Only seems to appear
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	When the test is sufficiently hard
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	If the test is easy it's important to point out
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	These effects don't happen
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's not that the gremlin is not there with you
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But he doesn't speak necessarily
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Until things get challenged as soon as the task is difficult
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Which means it for most of the test everybody's doing about the same it's only a problem number
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	17
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cosines and factorials whatever where things start to go wrong at least that's the theory at that problem
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The black student
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Starts to stiffen up a little bit
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Your blood pressure is elevated there
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Short-term memory is impaired
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Flicker of frustration through their body that wakes up the gremlin who starts
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To whisper in their ear I love you can do this
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is what they say about us true they don't think you can do it all the usual
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Even if the student doesn't believe it which is likely so you don't have to believe it that's
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The kind of Insidious thing here just the fact
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Did he has now
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Extra bit of mental chatter that little guy Whispering Willows a distraction
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Makes their performance go down
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Just a little bit hold this dialogue
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is keeping you from being 100% focused on the task at hand which is solving these problems who the real
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Subtle
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Power of a stereotype isn't it prevents you from doing the thing you want to do
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It diss track
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cu
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Forget the beat
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm doing the thing you want to do
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You and that may be all the difference
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So that's how we ended the piece that we did back in 2009 but in the Years
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,423	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	After Claude did that original study
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Defect
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,495	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	She called stereotype threat
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Became one of the biggest
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype threat and most important ideas
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,431	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In all of social psychology
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But now some psychologists say stereotypes can become self-fulfilling prophecy
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Steel ladies and gentlemen is my great pleasure 2%
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,391	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Clydesdale
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It became a sort of academic
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Rockstar
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Speaking to overflowing audiences to places like Columbia and
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cornell
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Steel
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And this idea of a stereotype threat was shown to be relevant in cases with that had to do with age and socioeconomic status
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	There were studies about women playing chess
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Men being tested on like social Sensitivity I mean
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Clyde's work ended up inspiring sort of the whole
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Generation of social psychology
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah I mean I was I would say that
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The original stereotype threat paper by Steele and Aronson you blew me away
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Spoke to me and was beautiful and it seemed to
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Offer
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Answers
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You have two questions that you have come with me
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So this is Michael and
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I'm
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	A professor of psychology at
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	University of Toronto
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So when did you begin
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	If you could give us over the cliff notes version of your history with
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:19,231	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype threat in particular
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I mean
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I think
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I was certainly attracted to
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That's that part of social psychology that dealt with prejudice and discrimination
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Some Jewish I went to New Jewish
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They scored High School in Canada
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Perhaps bacon to me was
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:38,175	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Desire to to prefer social justice
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And you know seeing you know what the evils of prejudice and you know how
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It was evil taking their logic
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Dreamwalker happens
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I was passionate about the topic
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sort of explanation that also offered
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Route to easy solutions
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Text effects
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sounds like you really came into it with a very social political
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Should have been stuite yes that's right
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I wanted my work to have an impact I wanted it to
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You have to change the world
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Coming up after the break
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Michael tried to change the world but the world kind of changes
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,855	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah

EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I request
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,295	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling

EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It just means you read back and say
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Well
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,631	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	How do they do that
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,679	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Do you
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But it doesn't have anything to do with it

EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Brilliance
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Chad Robert Radiolab we're back
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And we're talking about Claude Steele's seminal research
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	On stereotype threat how the threat of a negative stereotype
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Can impact a person's academic performance
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sprite and just before the break we were talking to Michael into it
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cool after getting into stereotype threat research you went on to grad school and really
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Focused in on stereotype threat as his
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Fielder's choice
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah so how many studies of stereotype threat did you end up to it
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I would say in the order of like
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Number of studies
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	20 maybe 15 to 20 something like that
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	He did a lot of studies on women's performance in math but also just looking at different environments and how they create or incur
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Courage the stereotypes
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And over the course of his career he ended up editing a book about stereotype threat
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,983	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I mean numerous
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:48,383	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Talks on the subject all over the world even signed a brief kind of explaining stereotype threat to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	States the Supreme Court heard the oral argument in Fisher V University of Texas at Austin as it applied to the question
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Of affirmative action the court will decide where the race used in University and College admission policies it's constant
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm sorry you don't put my name to this
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But then
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:17,055	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I started my current job at the University of Toronto
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In 2005 and while he was there he was running a lot of his stereotype threat research on women and men
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Matthew know giving women a test and then doing some intervention to reduce the stereotyped and seeing if there be a difference in
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Standard test scores
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sympathy
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	For the first time I was not able to consistently
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Show any effect of stereotype threat in other words the women who had received this
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype threat reducing intervention perform just about the same as the women who hadn't
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,151	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Belta Tropical Smoothie
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Let me go back to the drawing board let me think about
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What is my house my population differ
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And his first thought was maybe have something to do with Toronto petrano
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Someplace like take the Freshman psych classes
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	We're talking about a third East Asian 1/3 South Asian and only about 15%
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Caucasian or european Canadian
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And then a little bit of everything else so he started wondering
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	About you know women in math
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm in remarkably when I would ask you know our students this
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:33,599	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Mikey task know who here is heard of The Stereotype that women are bad at math I would say no more than
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Like a quarter to a third
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Add your strong awareness of the stereotype
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Joey started running experiments again but I'd only pek
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Those women and men
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Who actually had awareness
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But even then
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I still then come get the f
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm so sick okay well
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Maybe I'm doing something wrong like maybe the interventions he was designing weren't reducing the threat or with these goons maybe this
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The threat just wasn't that much of a threat in the first place
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,271	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But by this time Michael had already done
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Ton of research on
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype threat and you know I done I'm a person who gets bored
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,439	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	A rather quickly Majesty know started
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Amazon
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But just a couple years later well so
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Things changed
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	On October 17th
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	2011 this one paper was published in the paper called
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	False positive psychology
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In this paper details
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Help just by doing some very standard practices
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In Psychology research you could sometimes end up with
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	These sort of
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Ludacris conclusion
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So you're saying there was this paper was showing ways in which
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Experimenters could subtly unknowingly juice the results that is NC
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What it was essentially so the paper was pointing out that it becomes her standard practice that you know when you were research
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Searching for some effect like oh how happy people were about well they did on a test
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That you would measure that thing in a couple different ways
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:10,367	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Which direction is considered a good practice right you want to know one measure captures your konstrukt perfectly
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So you should measure that thing in this many You Know Places pasta
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But now what if you find that it could Works your hypothesis
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Just confirmed with one of those measures
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But it's not confirmed with
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Three or four of the other one
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And it was not uncommon practice at that point to just be no report the one place where you got in effect
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You could even argue that you were just
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Dialing in exactly where this effect
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Happens but the paper this fall psychology paper pointed out that if you ignore the places
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Where it didn't work a picture of
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Weather
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Find the data you look at all of it
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Might not actually support
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Your conclusion I remember reading that
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	My jaw dropped
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I sent this
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This paper I circulated it to the other faculty in my department
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	All of us
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are many of us
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I saw the
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The importance of this paper
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And we we call emergency meeting for a call emergency meeting
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What is an emergency meeting look like
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The Graduate students
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Discuss the contents of the paper
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To see what I meant
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What implications were and if they talked it over they realize that in some ways probably some of their own work
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Mom had fallen prey to the problems that this paper was
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I did see myself in in some of this
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I thought
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know how like will he know
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What has been implicated what papers of mine
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What paper is more generally have been implicated in the fields unibit large
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And in fact meetings like the one that Michael found himself in start happening at universities and conferences
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	All over the world
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	People looked at that paper and everyone thought
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Just an anger again this is this is what we're all doing the stuff
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And now we know from this
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	One paper that
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's very very easy to turn up
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Spray lining
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah it change change everything because a group of scientists are taking well maybe we really need to go back and Rihanna
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Investigate some of the key findings in our feet like all them high power replication so you're just kind of doing the same thing but
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	More people so they start doing these studies with bigger sample sizes and with strict rules about what data you were looking at
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Say hi to find exactly what they're going to do and how they're going to analyze data
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So you know there's
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:36,544	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	No possibility of monkeying around
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	2
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Get the answer you want
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Any attempts to replicate or reproduce no major findings in social psychology
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And after
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Panic that went along with it
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Came to be known as
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The replication crisis
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The Cornerstone of science
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	News articles
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are talking about
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The reproducibility crisis
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Ensign like oh man
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What's your what is going on here
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Because as they re-examine some of these studies
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,240	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The facial feedback
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But he's got lots of coverage in newspapers and magazines
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	He pardoned today involves
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Some of these replications
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Where
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Feeling specifically what got me reeling it's covering the replication crisis was
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	News about ego depletion
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So this is a whole literature of studies that were all about
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	How we sort of use up
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Our willpower
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Original studies
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You going to a lab in your presented with a
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	A dish of delicious fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies I love the method section of that paper they described baking the cookies in the lab
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Set up a snail would be
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Around the subject when they come in
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And they they put these cookies on it so you can't have any cookies
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:54,880	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And then they leave you alone with a cookies and what I found was that you know if someone has to sit there resisting a cook
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Cookie with it right in front of them in the smell is walking up their nose as they sit there if they have to go through that it'll actually be much
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Harder for them
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Complete certain kinds of logic
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:09,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In the argument was he use willpower on Dino task a
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Then you try to do tasks be and you just won't have a store will power unless
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Later studies found you drink some lemonade in the meantime because sugar the argument goes replenishes your willpower
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Increasingly bizarre elaborations of this original Theory
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It ended up working with M&Ms ended up working with cookies
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Over the years dance has this idea that you use of willpower one place and have less than another just started entering all
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Three corners of Our Lives the inside of that original study was
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Replicated again and again and again for deca
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:43,520	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But then this group of scientist get this massive
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Effort to replicate the original study
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They had over 2000
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Subjects
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They follow these rigorous rules about like what day they were going to look at this is as rigorous a replication is
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	As you can get
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And they just found
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Like no offense
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,672	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Basically no affair
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Brake brake system understand like how is it the dark that they're finding
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Nothing now but before they had a study that was then replicated
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	A bunch of times in a bunch
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Labs
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Look what I still don't get
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What's
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So so you have that original cookies
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I think it's notable that no other studies that I know of used cookies
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,456	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Now I found studies were M&M's where use
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That just makes me wonder I have no idea how that
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Lab to their study
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It makes me wonder what would happen if I ran a lab and I wanted to reproduce
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Does cookie find
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:40,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Standing in a New Direction and I kept trying it with cookies and it just never worked
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Let me try it with
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Charleston Chews
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Doesn't work because it's not hard to resist
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Baby Charleston shoes
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are not good candy and I end up in like I do with M&Ms and it works
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Boom there's my dissertation I publish a paper out of it
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:00,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So now that's in literature and so now ego depletion seems like an even
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stronger more valued thing because it's not just about cookies now it's about cookies are M&M's
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	My point is that you don't really know how many things were tried and each individual lab do you think that might be
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,912	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What's happening in these Labs is that there's a lot of
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Trial and error in the heroes or swept
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Decide
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And the successes
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are offered up and then suddenly you have one more success that bolsters the idea is that what you think might be happening I think so
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That is
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The heart
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:37,440	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Whatever the problems are not with those follow-up studies the big thing was that scientists work continuing to fail
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,976	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Hell at replicating these
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Bigen in Fairly well-known
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,304	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Studies like the
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The idea that when you smile it
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Changes your mood or
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,424	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Start

EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The idea presented in one of the most watched
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	TED Talks ever that the way you sort of
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Hold yourself or stand
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yourself big
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stretch out
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:05,600	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The idea that that could have a measurable impact on your behavior or even your hormone levels
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:10,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That one also failed to replicate that kept happening with study after study and of course
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The other people come back and say all the Wrecker
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Application effort wasn't done right or you didn't really design it well you're seeing a lot of the researchers
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Who have made their career studying certain effect
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:23,520	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They're just
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Not budging
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Few of them are but most of them are not budging so
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You just have a split for a man
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Iowan researcher describe to me a second civil war was in social psychology
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Estates of stereotypes
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Threat
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Now
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Itself under threat is it one of these
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Bodies of research being we thought well
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,072	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	No one has yet done the big multi-site
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Pre-registered
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Replication that they did for ego depletion the one that like really woke me up to this
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But Dan says there have been sort of smaller-scale here and they're kind of attempt
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To replicate some of the studies and
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know some of those had failed some studies came out to
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Found it
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know what
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I tried to redo I tried to do the stereotype threat thing on a big group of students
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I found it sometimes
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The opposite happen when I try to induce stereotype threat the students did better
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,584	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's a beautiful day
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Will let me let me say this maybe this
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Wealthier I fix this is something
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know I thought a lot about in the very beginning when we talked about all this
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Couple things
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	First of all
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This research has been dramatically well replicated
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Threat effect has been demonstrated
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Way more times and way more
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Send really any of those
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,672	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Psychology
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Study zone of this another
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:47,744	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It is another phenomenon it has
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,280	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Mapreduce so many demonstrations
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	If you can't replicate
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	One of them
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Six of them
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I don't know I wouldn't
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:57,984	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I would that doesn't surprise me
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	He says you know you can even see the failures that's just information about where the effect really applies and where
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Where does this is science
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Gradually getting sophisticated enough
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To help
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Applied inappropriate places
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	For example he says he would only expect the effect to appear
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	At times when the person is really invested
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What they're trying to do
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Linda's the negative stereotype
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Really
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Threatening
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	On top of that he says
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:27,424	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The kinds of stereotypes that are actually threatening to a given group
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Might change
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:35,360	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Overtime if you just exactly replicated what we did 25 years ago I'm I'm not sure that the
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stimuli and that procedures would have the same meaning
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What's today's
EDL	00:29:38,944	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	College students
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That they had been
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Delete your social psychology
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The meanings come from the
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Contemporary moment the way the state of the culture at that time
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,208	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Jimmy that is interesting actually
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That is what this research is doing is studying like an individual's
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,352	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Relationship to life
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Threaten like
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,936	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That's going to be different
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:04,800	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Anyone who you are because you're going to find different things threatening where you are or even when you are
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:07,360	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah I don't have I don't
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I think I know enough
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,408	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	About
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,432	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Quote the cultural
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Black students
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Today versus
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The cultural
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,040	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Black students 25 years ago
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But it wouldn't surprise me
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That there is some real difference
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	So I don't put as much stock
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In the exact replication of
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Experiment A or B
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yes I do
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In the
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,864	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Conceptual replication
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:32,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is it possible I mean you mentioned there just hundreds of studies that
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Kind of foggy circle around the same idea in different ways
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:37,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That is
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:40,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Artspace very compelling
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Evelyn

EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Robust phenomenon
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But the same time you know there's people who gather all the data together and they say look you know maybe there's some kind of bias
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Lips in when people are genius resources they just keep
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,536	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Trying different versions until they
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:58,816	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Get
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Something that looks like a results
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,144	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Does that seem plausible to you
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,752	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Boy that's a deeply
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,104	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I guess cynical
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Account of
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I was scientific
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Literature this big
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It would seem
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:22,624	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It doesn't seem highly probable to me
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is clearly real or applicable under these circumstances we just because they're not everything
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Doesn't mean they're not
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Incredibly important to
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To the progress of this
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Society
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Stereotype threat is pretty unique in the fact that many of the
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,544	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Studies in this literature are not just in the lab
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	They've been taken out into the streets with
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,384	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The real people
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,152	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That's really where the
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know the tire meets the road is can you actually move
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Educational performance
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Of real people
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In real
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	School situation
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Jean-Claude actually sent us a list of several dozen studies
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Showing that that interventions designed to reduce stereotype threat
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Can have
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Traumatic
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And long-lasting effects on achievement
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:09,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Now we should say there was at least one case
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are there was a study done in 2000
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	6 that a researcher try to replicate in 2011
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is much smaller
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm the original
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	2069 just last year
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You did it again with more students this time
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,040	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I got
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,832	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Pretty much nothing
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is the same guy in the same school system trying to do the same study
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:35,840	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	With you know hundreds and hundreds of kids and he came up with nothing serious to know Lehman given that replication is become a cop
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,888	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Conversation that you have to unfortunately contend with
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I'm just curious if it
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Change your opinion of the work
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	No
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I don't think there's anything
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This whole thing is not true
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:51,968	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I mean
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I want the truth out there more than I want anything else
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is Steve Spencer he was in early collaborator with Claude Steele especially on those studies involving women and math test
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I did recognize
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:06,048	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In some of the critiques real issues that we need to deal with
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But Steve like Claude is very confident in in the results of his studies in the effect
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Of the stereotype threat in general so much so that I'm writing right now and article
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:23,712	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Where I'm going to disclose every single study I've ever done what the results are input the data up for everybody.
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:26,272	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I will admit
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To the questionable research practices that I've done
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,648	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Be as forthcoming and honest with everything in my own lab
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:41,632	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	In addition to doing that I've entered into an adversarial collaboration it's called which just means he's going to do
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:47,520	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Big scale reproduction study with people who have serious doubts about whether stereotype threat is real
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,616	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know I can't say I haven't time what my reaction will be
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I think what I can promise is that I will take
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:55,712	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The findings very serious
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And I will do my utmost not to be defensive about
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:07,232	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Are you nervous about this I mean it's looks the stakes are pretty awesome I mean
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,000	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,304	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What you mean the stakes are high
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I mean I'm a full Professor I have 10-year real steaks for me in this
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Not really much
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:21,824	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But will not everyone in the field is
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Handling these
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	These kinds of niggling doubt
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:28,224	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Sowell there so many pieces of evidence that things are not alright
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This again is Michael inslicht the professor from Toronto
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,088	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	2

EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Squid
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:37,696	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Dr. The probability the likelihood
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,744	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That all this might have been for naught
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,512	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Or much of it
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Vitamin for nausea
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:45,632	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It's a loss of meaning
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What was I doing good work with the contribute to knowledge
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:55,872	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I would have part of the problem
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Weather
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:58,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	No signal
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:08,416	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I think the effect is Ino
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:09,696	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It might be there
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,744	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	But it might be so small as to not be
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Naughty meaning clean parts
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	How to say I know it's hard to know where to
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And on this
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Well one thing that you know
EDL	00:35:32,480	00:35:34,016	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	To make clear is it stereotype
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,576	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You really damaging it mean having someone tell you
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You suck at something when you're under
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	The gun to do it
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That's always going to
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,256	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know that's going to happen effect I guess the question is
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,280	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	How you know
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:46,816	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What affected
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:47,584	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Exactly
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And when
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:50,400	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And how and why
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	What can you do about it and
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:52,704	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And those
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Things feel like maybe
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	I guess it feels like the part of me that wanted this
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Be a kind of
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Very simple fix
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	That would work everywhere answer
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Save the world
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:04,992	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	You know that part
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Bleeding Out feeling a little bit
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Lot like wearing the
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This whole thing is shrinking
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah totally
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	It does feel a weird little girl growing up a little bit
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:18,560	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Is it you kind of have to walk away from the those big simple promise
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Yeah maybe that's
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:23,680	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	Exactly what you need in order to be able to find the smaller place
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	This is for you
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:25,216	| radiolab_podcast17stereothreat |	And have an effect
