EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	The guillotine Falls
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,455	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Trust is tough to build on a timer
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And I need to be the person he will trust

EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	At least

EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They were doing all sorts of major a praise

EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	You can have a losing leg of a trade but the trade is a whole is a winner who's a three-legged trade he wouldn't even tolerate
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	For some reason
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Every single trade every single leg of every single trade had to be a winner that doesn't happen in real life
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And no one can demand that of their money badge room each of the Big 4 pay back Millions

EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And it's impossible for Schwartz to say for certain
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Who knew what
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	What he can say is there was activity in the accounts of the Big Four
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,248	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Backwood raise
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Questions in the eyes of

EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	But
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	No one has the ability to rewrite history
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Entering stocks into bonds
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And so these men mostly older powerful mentors to Madoff
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Open for me a new door into the Madoff Ponzi operation
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They gave Bernie his break
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And then demanded that he provide them things he couldn't honestly achieve
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	These people are these people who are
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Everett is
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They are asking for things that are not
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Possible
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:24,768	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Bernie is accomplishing those things
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	So now ask yourself who has the power in that relationship
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Is it barely because he knows he's doing illegal things for these parties
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Or is it the
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	The party who said who's now making Bernie do illegal things
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	It's both of them but when burning since you gosh like
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I I discovered that people are really greedy
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Member that was in the beginning
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Is this what he means that these people were using him
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	This is what their name means end and Bernie has actually
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Particular enmity for those big 4
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	One of them jeffry picower
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Cook-Out 7 billion dollars
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	It's getting billion dollars from this eating right beyond what he invested
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	That's a longhorn who produced the series now the story of jeffry picower
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Is one of the more dramatic moments in the series
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:21,600	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	What's going on
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:26,208	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	10 months after Bernie Madoff arrest

EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	The fort picower went for his final swim
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Bernie phone him

EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:32,256	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Regarding the death of someone
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,304	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	What this says about Bernie Madoff
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Who he is
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Whenever someone hears that I interviewed Madoff
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They always want to know this Bernie feel remorse
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I'd interviewed serial killers child rapists
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	People considered monsters
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I suspended judgment
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I want to hear their stories
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	To understand them
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:00,672	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	This doesn't mean I wasn't horrified by what I heard
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	But I try to see the world through their eyes
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	An exercise in empathy
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,072	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	At times
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I feel empathy for Bernie
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	But here's what struck me about Bernie
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	He
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Didn't feel empathy
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:17,312	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Declaimed feel remorse
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Now the words but
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	There was always a but
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	On the phone with me
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:06,976	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Every single time Bernie mentions victims
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	He can barely get
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,280	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Through the apology
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:11,328	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Before interrupting himself
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They were warned they were greedy
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,168	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Always this strange
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Sorry not sorry
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:23,104	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I could go crazy and do something stupid
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	It's Joey if you want it
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,016	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	So put your money in
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	It's impossible to tell the story of The Fall of the House of Madoff
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,976	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Without understanding that there were real
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Real suffering
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Back in early 2009
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:47,424	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Victims were telling stories of their ruined lives
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,472	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	On TV on the radio
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	On every local talk show it was the worst thing that ever happened to us
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	This can't be real we have lost everything I've lost everything and you've lost everything everything
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	That we work for you down the green
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	X at the end of the month I
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,848	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	I made a lot of money for a lot of people
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:28,128	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Did you catch
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	What's the remorse
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Or was it too fleeting to register in your brain
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:35,808	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	My producers and I were in touch with dozens of victims
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:37,856	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	To the victims
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,904	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Bernie's indifference was enraging
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	All over again
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,512	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	But it wasn't the slightest bit surprising
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,072	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	What is surprising
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Is what happened to victims
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:52,448	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Since Madoff drag their 65 billion dollars
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Down a dark

EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	There is any
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Industry that is created around the Madoff collapse
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	There

EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	In good faith
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,376	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	They given Bernie

EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	There are the banks
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,512	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And the investment institutions
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	That

EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Bernie Madoff
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	As a safe bet you know he was weaponized
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	By the financial system
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:45,344	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	And so we wondered why worth
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	Those hedge funds accountable
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:48,928	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	For not doing their job

EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,568	| radiolab_podcast17ponzi |	About why the people who
