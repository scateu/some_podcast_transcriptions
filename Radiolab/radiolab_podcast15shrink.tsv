EDL	00:00:09,472	00:00:13,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Radiolab WNYC
EDL	00:00:17,152	00:00:23,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Come On Eileen
EDL	00:00:23,552	00:00:29,696	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hey this is Radiolab on something that's a little bit unorthodox today least for us
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:33,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah if you listen to the show in the last
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	10 years
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,864	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You understand it like
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,400	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We like to edit
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Brightwheel
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:40,448	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do you like a good at it
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:44,544	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or 70 but today play something that has
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:45,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Almost no edits at all
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's just a conversation
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Which is of course the foundation what we do
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,200	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These long
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,736	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Rambling
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:55,296	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Occasionally profane
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:56,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Error
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Strewn conversations that we've been at it into something coherent
EDL	00:00:59,648	00:01:00,416	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Today
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,208	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I want to show you the messiness no edit
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This is a
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:07,072	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Chunk of a conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He came and sat down with us
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:10,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A while back
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:10,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Can we talk
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:11,680	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	4 hours
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,448	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Two of those hours
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:15,008	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Became the basis for
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Crispr podcast it was a few podcasts to go this about Gene editing
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then we kept on going for another two hours and he told us
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This story actually two stories with rolling play one
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That I thought was really cool
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's about this
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	New way of looking at life
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's not a
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah we can get through this a lot faster than
EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I really like
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,120	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How do I I need
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Perfect perfect way to describe
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Biological bomb Okay so
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,664	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Chappie
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	After 2
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The story monster
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's the Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Being
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I say what
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Once Upon a Time being before 2003
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We basically had two kinds
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,632	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Of
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Living things on
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,704	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That we had
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cellular life and we had Myra
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Send
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There was nice and distinct
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And clear-cut
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And so
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,664	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cells included
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,992	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's our bodies made of cells and
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bacteria which
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Single-celled
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	All the other
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Things that can grow and let their cells divide they have DNA they have proteins in the mail.
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then over here you have virus
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Viruses were just little packages of genetic material that
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Would go from cell to cell and use the cell to make new virus
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Enter inside of the mall they had with jeans
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A couple proteins that
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What then
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hijack
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Their house seem like soap
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Soap
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Preliminary
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They don't even maybe not even qualify as life right
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They can't grow on their own
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They can't generate their own energy
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Austin Eliza Schuyler life we
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mii Maker
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Kind of fuel called ATP
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We need that
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do every little thing in our body and virus
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Oasis don't make ATP so
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Can we say that life is
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ice cells and multicellular being
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:26,848	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then there's a
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like sort of
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Pseudo life
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	When you have these little
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah yeah a lot of people a lot of Sciences don't really think viruses are truly alive
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Even though they just have to take advantage of life
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To make more copies
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Custom questions of viruses they don't have a wall around them in the way they sell cells are walls
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Essential ER walldorf
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They might have a protein shell
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ends and so you know when the flu virus goes into a cell that protein shell
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Breaks open and the genes and proteins inside come out that you have containers
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The contain them forgot for a while
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Isn't that one of the
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Somebody who had a had a list of
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Rules that make you alive and what was in that container was one of those rules
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	If they have the container
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,047	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Right so the problem with viruses that they have
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Some of the things that we think are essential for life
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But not quite all of them so
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's been convenient just to say viruses are not
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,311	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm over there cuz I don't have everything
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That cellular life has
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What is Heather now
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Got a virus
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Gotcha
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So then what happened is that there was a scientist named
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Timothy rowbotham
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In England
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Who was investigating a
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Timothy Rudolph
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	English name in rowbotham with a fuzzy robots and was was working in Bradford
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	City in England
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	She was
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Looking at the kinds of bacteria that might be growing in
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:04,895	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A hospital
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah like they're they were having some problems with pneumonia outbreaks in Saint and he's like okay what
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Growing around
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And so he went to
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,159	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Turn off cooling tower
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Pur water on top of the hospital and he took a sample in the
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Went and put it under his microscope and he's like some interesting bacteria are all here so
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Very interesting bacteria that
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Didn't I look like anything I've seen before
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Stop and just kind of crawl around to weird places and just snatched little snippet to
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Scummer what Woody
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	John is a microbiologist
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:45,087	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So it would be good to know like I mean
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't like about just do it just go scrape little
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's a rocker
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What are 10 words the world I mean microbes are everywhere so microbiologist go everywhere to find microbes so there
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Steven Universe
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,631	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Water tower on hospice
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Received it with you in a in a kind of an investigatory role he was trying to help them
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,799	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Help them figure out which bacteria
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Make music
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm that was one of the hopes
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But he was
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Thinking of doing a survey because you know their diseases like Legionnaires disease which
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,623	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know I grow in these desert containers of water
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know that's
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There there's some concern about that
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's so you know better to get to know what's growing
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Tow
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He's particularly taken by one
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Thing that he assumes is bacteria and it's got a kind of interesting kind of rounded shape America
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And when bacteria around you can call him
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cocci
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A caucus
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm so he names this Bradford caucus
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Give it a name
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's why the caucus name it comes up as referring to the shape
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Except
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Streptococcus
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Is because it's
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:52,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's round
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I did not know
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The things you learn
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So so
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He's trying to study this thing and it's trying to
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So one when your machabeli just the way you study bacterias you get them to grow
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And he can't get this to growlies feeding at things in a cell
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I crying why is it not growing I can't figure it out and
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Eventually
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know he e just hit the hit the wall
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And unfortunately
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	His lab
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Got shut down
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm in so he
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Basically said okay I don't want to
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Throw the stuff out
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm going to
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm going to give it
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To some of my colleagues in
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It was it wasn't dying which was growing scientist named Bernard lascola
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And is called
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they going to put a butterfly
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then he just says I'm
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You just set that aside for a while and doesn't you know
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Was just more bacteria you know and end
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ads for some reason
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He decided to
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'll take a look at this Bradford caucus
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know I'm like what was this thing that that robot them
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,655	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I was talking about
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So he looks at it and he says
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay this is the size of
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bacteria on butt
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It looks like a gigantic virus
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A virus is usually very small
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,855	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Tell bacteria to a virus is like
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like hundreds of times bigger hundreds of times
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,999	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hotel Queen Mary 2
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Writing that he looked up close and he was like
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What is this thing
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This doesn't look right this this
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,935	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	If I didn't know better I'd say this
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This was a virus
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Vis-a-vis based on
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Internal Orion
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,311	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Chichen Itza pyramids
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mexican that had the protein thingy and host of viruses they have a shell
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Beta protein
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And the shells going to compose a plate
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So it kind of looks like a soccer ball
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Says a very distinctive look
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It look like that
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It look like that
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Didn't look like bacteria
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's like wait a minute
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You could this be a virus
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,447	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This would be like in maybe like finding an enormous soccer ball
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In the woods
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yes to he's found the
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The Leviathan equivalent
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Virus
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Right it didn't make sense it was good it was kind of crazy
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In that microscopic round to say maybe this is a vine
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Wait to dinner
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,319	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To Brad Mumford what's his name again
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Timothy rowbotham
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Rowbotham
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Didn't have this
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Realization
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He hadn't looked at it closely enough
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He looked at it
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But he just didn't somehow put that pussy
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:44,959	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Did this is a virus and click Formosa Tuesday Wednesday
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And it's
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	If it's likely that other people were looking at the same things in years before
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm thinking there bacteria
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Here's a big fear something the size of bacteria
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Because viruses are always small then they that you wouldn't think of
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Spell viruses
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are always small in the sense that
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They were discovered because they were small
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The basic design what scientist did was they they discovered viruses by filtering
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Fluid from a sick plant or sick animal
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Through a filter porcelain actually and it was so small that that
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Anything the size of bacteria got trapped in the porcelain and anything smaller
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And lo and behold I could find things that could cause sickness
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In that fluid
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cast of the film
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's the discovery of viruses meant he was innately small because that's how you feel
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's what they were looking
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So they were probably Generations the scientists who were looking in through microscopes
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Saw some interesting around saying and assumed it was
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Is bacteria and was probably a virus
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	F*** is this giant
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant Leviathan
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Virus
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I seen that was his question
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well I mean would that he first he had to really establish that it wasn't so what happened was that
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm eating look very closely at it and kind of work at its chemistry
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And the more I looked at it
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The more
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It look like a virus he started
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Abdul
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Start acting looking at its DNA which hadn't been possible before
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,679	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Turned out that its DNA resemble
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The DNA viruses not have any known
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bacteria
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I didn't have
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I didn't actually didn't have the the the
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Equipment for making fuel inside of it
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then the real kicker was that
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He found out how to grow it
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What he had to do was he had to stick
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This thing inside of
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Amoeba
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then out of the ameba will come
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Laura Bradford caucus
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Just like a virus
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Exactly like a virus so you need to change the name for Bradford Cox
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This is something else so they named it meme
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mimi viral virus
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Because they were in France and memes
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,455	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In the in a French Opera
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	He was mimicking
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:10,111	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mini Me
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Is that like a French word for Mac
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I think I just took another beginning of mimic and added it to virus
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I guess it's the same thing twice meme
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I get it
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So this so
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This is what I mean this was really bizarre when they published
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The report on this in 2000
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Three men people really scratch your head because
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Remember you no ordinary viruses have you know maybe 10 jeans
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This one had a 1018 GMC
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	When you have 10 jeans go to the gene site so you have a protein capsule
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So you can
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Swim Tuesday so when you land on the soil you can borrow in
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then explodes
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Make baby
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's not much to being a virus than just
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Need a few genes for that
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:06,943	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Does this thing have particular talents that the other viruses didn't have
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:11,551	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's okay well so what's one thing that's really interesting is
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What happens when it goes inside
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Host
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	An amoeba
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It goes in
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But instead of
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Kind of
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,815	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shutting off that protein coat and just
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Spilling out its contents it actually goes in
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Stays
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	As it was
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,031	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mainstays lights
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's called a virus Factory
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Once it's inside there their they're
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's this thing they call the virus Factory
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And it basically is able to
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To do
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Things
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Vino components come into it and then
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then it was her work it has enzymes that can
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,047	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Refashion them and then they
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Outcome the components for new job starts going to the nucleus of the already existing cell
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So interesting so it it it wouldn't you like to know
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It sucks up some stuff and yeah it has it's beautiful sort of they called a Stargate
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Because it's shaped like it's a doorway shaped like a
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Estar and things come in and then
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then I have another Stargate
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They Ducati desert manufactured things come out and then in the Sally assemble into new job
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant viruses
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:28,607	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It spits out the raw materials and then self-assemble into a giant
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A giant Leviathan no baby how did they get out of the
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do they explode to the surface
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They did not blow out
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah that's like a totally that's a totally different name into the machine
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's already there cuz their parents
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Use the living thing
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:49,343	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This thing is I have a weird kind of
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Respect for the
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:55,743	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Oh yeah it's it's amazing and you don't want the amazing things about it is that
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It can get its own virus
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It gets there are
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,799	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Call Vero sages and they actually go into the virus Factory
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And high jacket
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Intercity outcome Vera face
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:16,479	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Oh wow yes soon as he live virus Factory that's what a virus want
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Now the virus has its own virus Factory was going to get
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's going viral viral
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Right
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Weird
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Back that weird is the right word I say
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Write notes on 2003 you know you could say well this is one weird virus
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But these are just as well I wonder what else there is
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's like
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Did that score the basic so they said okay Scott all this extra genetic
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Power
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But he's doing this sort of special circus act here it's building its own Factory
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And it's just
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Behaving differently, so maybe it just needs all those jeans to do this
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Special things to me
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How much is it when they looked at these you know 2018 jeans most of them didn't match anything anyone at found before
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Your new jeans
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Jeans yet that you couldn't even guess at what they were at this is got to be
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We from life is like
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Aliens from Saturn
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Is that where you driving with the story
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Not quite but I still waiting so they look at all the G they look at the the chemistry of
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like this as it's no namae don't find any matches for this little thing
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	For most of the genes they couldn't find a match
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah you can look at it I mean what is it what is this and where does it come from cuz it doesn't seem to
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I have the smell of of Earth life
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah I got that it uses DNA
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I mean it is has protein and uses our chemistry but it's it's
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Doing something
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And so these scientists said well okay they looked in in English
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hospital
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Meowth water
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cooling tower let's go look at one here in France
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they looked
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they found another giant virus which is even bigger than the one that they
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Already found
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	She says this is a cooling tower phenomenon of our rooftop biology
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well it's excitement Galore it's more like the drunk looking for the keys under the lamp
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's like
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know that openness wherever you look there that we know that we know there was viruses found in one
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Water tower so let's go look in another water tower
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like that's our safest bet
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And hey we found an even bigger one you know which they
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Which even bigger it was even bigger yet so instead of 1018 jeans it had
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	1059 jeans
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So they named this one Mama virus
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mimi's first cousin Mama Mimi didn't do it was
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Did it also build a virus Factory so it's like so there's something there's a common theme here we
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ready to die of two giant viruses doing the same thing
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Dennis the whole Stargate and everything
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's weird is that you know the mama virus has a bunch of genes that Mimi virus doesn't have
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So it's like
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And again don't match anything
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So I don't know what to do
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Some of them look like they're involved in
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Building proteins
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Which doesn't make any sense because viruses are not supposed to do that
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So it's it's this is all completely confusing
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But then they said okay
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Maybe we need to kind of get away from the whole body
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's our thing and you don't widen our little will you go back to the opposite of a water tower would be like the bottle
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bottom of a well or is it or do you go to a library and look in the interior of
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Old
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Parchment books
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Now you start looking at places like new look
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You look in the ocean
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or you looking sediment
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or you look inside animals
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	More or you
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Look in the soil and
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They start
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Finding
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant viruses over and over and over again
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Really yeah in all those places
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Emmanuel inside of animals like in animals tummies or something
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah so they they went to
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Disease researchers went to Brazil
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And said let's go
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Look at animals
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Can find giant viruses
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they found a new species in
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cows and they found a new species living inside of
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A monkey
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:27,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And these were where they finding giant or giant virus
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are the numbers of genes are going up and up and keep finding new record breaker
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So so the
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The biggest one right now
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Is called megabox
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The summer movie
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I mean there's
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In the world
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In a world
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Trackosaurus you know I was like this is like I I'm wondering what they're going to do
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	As I keep finding bigger ones
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Because you keep my having to find support
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Where was Mega founded
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mega I believe was found in the ocean
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And how many genes does Mega have
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mega
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Has
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	1120
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay so where is not actually the biggest
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It don't have the most genes but it's not actually the physically the biggest
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant virus
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Which was
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So this is this one is called a Pandora
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Let me guess
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Clean up in a sealed box and then they opened it and will it straighten it had this bizarre
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are shaped like an urn
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Completely nuts
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There's no urn-shaped
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,439	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like crazy
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Nmun the urn
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That remind somebody of
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The myth
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:56,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's a Pandora's Box was actually an urn
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm tired that's a very learning make you happy because they found it
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So what they did was
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are these Russian scientist they are clapping with
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Dug up
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Frozen tundra
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That had been frozen for 30000 years
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they said let's follow this out and see what's in there
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What kind of things have been asleep for thirty thousand years
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Beginning of a sci-fi movie
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Among other things they found pets
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They found pandoravirus
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And they not only did they find it but
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cebu day when they let it warm up a bit
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then they
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Gave it to me but at checkout they they did it
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,248	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Wow and how much bigger
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The first
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant virus-induced
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Attitude with
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Lego
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	An elephant sized Mouse
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Compared to that elephant size mouse how much bigger is
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Maybe it's more specific Hanabi I need to look at the numbers you know
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are kind of going from I don't know Elsa
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What you getting
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bigger and bigger and bigger
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mina pandoravirus is bigger than a lot of that
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bacteria
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These things are now being found
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,808	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Everywhere you look
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,880	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They are incredibly common
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Baby mini able to get
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant viruses out of people
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Really
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	WeChat what's up where are you find them in the person in our intestines or something
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I believe they
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Found one sample in somebody's lungs
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And another sample was found in someone's blood
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But it's really hard to tell whether they're
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Actually like actively invading us and and making us sick
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And maybe
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	7 rating amoebas they can
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,600	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Invade human cells
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Comedian human sellers
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Surprisingly similar
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or is it just kind of along for the ride with some amoeba that
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Infect us
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or does it kind of drift in and when people are sick their defenses are down
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:07,776	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	No we don't know if giant viruses have anything to do with human disease but
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Let me know if you have a category problem here and there if you've got a giant
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Virus that
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Virus like in its General
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shell
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But it's making proteins it's got a
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bunch of jeans
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Viruses don't have your already bigger than some bacteria should we call it as its own set
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	At this point
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's what people are arguing about
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Right now I mean keep that line between viruses and cellular life and just put the Giant
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Viruses with the viruses
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or do we kind of
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Blair the line Abyss feels like it's on its way from one category to the other so that's one of the big questions
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What way did this thing
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Go and Emmylou
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's that mean
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How do you get a job
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like how do you how do you well that and so
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Will get to the
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Henschel answer
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Answer to that question
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	China's totally fast
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	After the
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hi there this is Kirsten recording from Orlando Florida Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan

EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And I request
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	About what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kid
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,808	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do you
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:14,496	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It doesn't have anything to do with a test if you have a story

EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	AJ Radiolab so William return to our conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What's an unedited conversation
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And we were talking about
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Virus
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And what
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They can teach us about life which really starts with a simpler Quest
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like where the hell they come
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How do you get a giant fire
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like how do you
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How do you well that and so-so
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	One clue comes from those jeans
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So now that they're finding more Marty giant viruses
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They're defining enough variety of them they can they can look for a service and some
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Common genes that they share some some
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Common mutations in genes and their finding actually that that
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Looks like giant viruses might actually belong to one
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Lineage
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They're cousins they have a common ancestor
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yasso the tribe
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And if that's if that's
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	True it could be an incredibly old tribe
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These these giant viruses could be a lineage
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Conceivably that you know goes all the way back to you know the early stages of
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The dawn
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I really owe like a black back to the very beginning of life on Earth
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	2 that are right yeah
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I mean maybe
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,104	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	When
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cellular life was getting started
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But the question is what were the giant viruses like then
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Now some people have said well no giant viruses actually started his teeny tiny viruses and they've just been like
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,672	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Gathering up new jeans
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Through Time
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm just been getting bigger and bigger bigger
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know number the people who actually study giant viruses and it really you know
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Help us understand the most they're saying no we don't think so
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We actually think that
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These things
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Started out
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,104	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	As
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cellular life
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,664	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They were cells
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,688	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are full-blown sales
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You mean they were from the other side of the roadway where the cellular life. They switch
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The Heights
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So yeah they change teams
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How to know that
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like I can't have a plant that becomes an animal how did they sedate
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Started off as like what we would call
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Call creatures
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then they started actually alive
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:57,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know they think they re standing out there in the air the water or the
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Grounder like some free living microbes
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah and then why would you go demote yourself this is this is your problem with Paras
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:14,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Websites you keep saying mean things about parasite
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I had a choice
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's between being Ace intake having my own integrity and choosing to make a living on my own or just
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Suck love you I would just live on my own
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Excuse me for I know you like parasites
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do not use that that passage is a recording play it's already been cut
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So wait a second so you recording to this Theory you have a man's true nevertheless
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We have a microbe that is
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That is
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Doing its thing and then something happened
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay what is the something
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It becomes a parasite
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Becomes apparent
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know maybe a symbiont here basically what it does is it starts living inside
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:01,056	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Another
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So you need gives up its Integrity as in as a as a free
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Life
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Former free-standing life whatever that means
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's got a
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shell
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What kind of border
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's making its own energy
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Replicating in the way that
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Let the beginning at the beginning at the beginning it can make its own energy
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:25,376	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You can grow it can divide and do all the things that living things to do and then for some reason it chooses
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	2
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Require
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:32,800	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Some other creatures existence for its own it has it has to
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:36,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Become dependent on some other organism
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	For it's very very exist
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well it's flip it the other way and say it discovers a wonderful new home
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:44,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Inside of another cell
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It comes in as I got like I love leaving my Park Avenue apartment for a dark cave
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Exciting opportunities real estate
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:00,192	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Imagine you're like Bear Grylls
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay let's imagine
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You are like
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:06,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hiking around and killing your own food okay II
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Let's just try to picture that's okay Robert.
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You're you're getting your dear you're starting your own fires you're going on and on and on and you do that for
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	For like a few years
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:24,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And you're walking through the jungle and I'm very very skinny not going well
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	College that the Haggard Hunter
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Let's say you're doing this in Minnesota
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	All right sounds like cold
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:31,424	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,704	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then suddenly like
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:37,312	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You you get there's a break in the forest and you come across a
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:41,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mansion what is this place and you open the door
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And inside
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There's like conveyor belt
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Swell ice cream and steak
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know and end their slippers waiting for you and you know anything you need it
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's somebody else is taking care of it there is one thing you left out when I walk into this Magical Kingdom is it
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Doesn't let me out I can't leave
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ever again because I am become so dependent on its natural wonders
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But I lose my Independence my integrity
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Have a very very things I walked in with
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:16,224	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We did literally
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Music
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	We did and I did point out to you at the
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The time that
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You are quite
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:22,624	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Dependent on
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,416	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are there species
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Do you want me to bring us
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Weather Stacy episode 32
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It has eyes will roll right out of their sockets
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It sounds like becoming big being able to take advantage of another cell
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:48,736	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Evolutionarily speaking is is a great way to go
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Because
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You have all these things taken care of for you
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Now
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	According to this
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Siri these days
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mysterious ancient
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Microbes
EDL	00:32:01,536	00:32:03,072	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Started going into these cells
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And reproducing there and then
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Going out again and then finding another host cell to info
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are they making like were they making their host sick
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Probably yeah
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:18,176	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Probably because giant viruses are not good
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:21,504	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To get to see this is this complicates your Mansion metaphor
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:27,904	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Tiny bit because what it means is that you go in the conveyor belts when you feeding yourself and having a good time but then you're filled starts to
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:30,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Muck up the place and it starts to collapse from within that doesn't sound
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,280	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The Strain the metaphor bad boy
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Goy
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:39,936	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Rob Roy
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:46,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So so you you spend some time in this wonderful Mansion you you rest it's warm it's comfortable so on you you you
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,104	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You eat
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Bullet with your filth
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,432	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You start a family
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then I'll send you and your descendants
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:33:01,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Leave the Mansion the messages collapses from all the damage you did do it
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:05,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But you know actually you see in the distance there's another mansion
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Just go over there now you feel like rested and ready and like you have it all we got to do is get over there
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:14,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So let's just go that we don't have to we don't have to stop to to kill a deer we just go to that next mansion
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The ice cream is waiting
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:17,312	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I still got to walk
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So I need my legs
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:20,640	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So to speak to the next mansion
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But I don't need the powerful muscles that I would have needed to kill the deer I can let you know so you don't need
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You need
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:30,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know let's say that you were you know
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,904	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You don't even need the knowledge
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:35,232	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I've had to kill a deer we blind dumb
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Fat
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Zodiac where you end up
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They get rid of they start getting rid of these jeans
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:47,520	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And how does that happen
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:53,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know a random mutation comes along and just cuts out a bit of DNA them you're fine
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's okay I needed a moment worth
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:58,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Oh there goes a big chunk of me
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't need that
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I did that the regular kind of mutation
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:03,904	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That happens all the time
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Turn your your your successor
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Being
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Travels with lighter
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I was able to succeed just as well
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Right so you know if if if if
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:21,056	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know it if we are born you know which was a part of our DNA that's deleted that had some you know
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hemoglobin genes in it like
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Good night
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like that bad and mean
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:30,016	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	But you know but if you cut out a gene
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:34,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This giant virus no longer needs because
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's got everything Supply to it
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,440	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And it's host
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Find self
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The check that check it out so you have this
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So the idea is that you did these viruses
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The giant viruses but they actually
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:52,032	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Did Eddie Eddie how fast does a giant like these
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Imagining
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Back
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:54,848	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In the beginning
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:35:00,224	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There was there was not Mega not Jai nobody likes
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:06,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cellular near me
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:07,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Joy's Independence
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Size-wise it's a
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,232	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Blimp
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's a massive thing
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then suddenly starts to shrink
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,096	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I bit by bit by bit
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,888	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What at what rate does it
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Start to shrink and shut itself
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:21,472	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It could be that
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Giant viruses were finding
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	These giant viruses that scientist
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Are finding
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:31,712	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Could be shrinking very very very slowly
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:33,504	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Could be
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:35,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There are other viruses
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That made this transition that
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Tranq faster
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,512	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So maybe
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The race to the bottom maybe some some maybe some tiny viruses are just
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Former giant viruses
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That just shrink relief at least to the bottom it's just a different way of thinking about life you
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You generally assume
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Being a multicellular organism yourself
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,760	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That little things
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In some deep sense
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,832	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know you're not supposed to say this
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Want to be big
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You don't want to
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I know
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I know but most people unlike you a****** most people
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Think they're better than the podcast it's better to be more complex than to be simple but
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hear you're talking about a different Voyage all together
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:30,592	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It might just work out for you to be simple rather than complex
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:38,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well given the dead viruses are insanely abundant on this planet I mean there are
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:39,808	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	By some estimates
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,368	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	10
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	To the 31st power viruses on Earth
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:45,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Think about that like it's a it's a
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know it's a 1 with 31 zeros
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I mean
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:52,608	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Inconceivable
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:54,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How many viruses are on
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's their world
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,448	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Apparently you know Nature has not agreed
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:04,640	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What is interesting like thinking about how
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:06,944	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Lifeguard

EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Simpler
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	If it's true that this trajectory is a
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:14,880	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	SS
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Common as you say that
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That thing start out sometimes
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,976	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Start up big and then
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:22,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Learn to live inside other things and in the process get smaller and smaller
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I want smaller in this is actually maybe
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What happens to a lot of viruses not just some viruses
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:30,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It anyway it gives the virus and honorable history
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't know why I feel that way
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:35,616	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This boy isn't going to
EDL	00:37:35,616	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't know but then I mean
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Abandonment
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,856	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Reliving past right
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They gave in to The Temptations of the Mansion full of
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:49,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Steak and ice cream
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:53,024	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It's true but I've always assumed in this is
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,536	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Not
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:54,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Not
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:55,840	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Something wanted
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:57,120	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Seem that viruses were
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A kind of Proto organism
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	They Were Somehow at the beginning of something and I never quite got going
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:06,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah but this is you're actually saying that these viruses are
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,872	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	In a way at the end
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	At the end but there at the
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:12,736	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't know how to quite use the words that I want to use
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:16,320	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The snakes feel something at the end of something out of the beginning
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like you just took that you just took what I consider to be the beginning
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:22,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And you've now made it then
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:23,232	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And end
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	An end that's interesting I never
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yeah. So I can go in different directions
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:33,472	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And how far can a Traverse
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Journey
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,288	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Go I mean can you go from like
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,336	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How big did that
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,360	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	It was never liked
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Turtle with
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,920	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	With a with things
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:43,200	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	All right now
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:44,480	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like a giant dinosaur
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	No
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:49,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Sorry I know there are things going I believe they're going to mixes Owens
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:52,672	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Which
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,720	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Started out as free living animals
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And have become
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:58,816	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Parasites and they're just down to just a few cell
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hay Day
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:05,728	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Myxozoa animals you don't mean animals in the way that animals
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:10,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	My pet my pet jellyfish
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,872	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Really really
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,688	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So you're saying a jellyfish size
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Thing has now reduced itself to a tiny Speck microscopic parasite
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,552	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Get the
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I don't even say it because you can't do it if you're that small
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's insane
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Andrea Lee
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like it going from something you can see and would want to avoid while swimming
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Down to something that you might even just breathing without even knowing it
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,752	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You blowing my mind
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shrinking
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:41,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Mixes
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Message
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How do you spell that
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Myx
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,712	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Xxio 8
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:51,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I'm trying in my mind to construct a scenario where we
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like the mixes on
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Could begin to shed
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:58,464	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Like if we were living inside then like not the iPhone with the eye
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:39:59,744	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	IHome
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The IUD you know but the but the fact is that we can all we have
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,888	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cast aside some things
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You know what a weak acid
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,728	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well we can't smell better I know that
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:13,824	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I know that'll better and we used to be able to make her own vitamin C in our own bodies
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,616	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Our own bodies were vitamin C Factor
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Really
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Wait what what change that
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:21,504	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	How did we want to let go that it sounds great
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:25,856	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Sunshine vitamin C vitamin C
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:29,952	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Well if you are sitting around eating fruit all
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,256	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Fruit which is loaded invited
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:32,768	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	AMC
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:38,144	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	If you get a mutation on your vitamin C Gene well
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Yep you're fine cuz you're you you're getting your vitamin C from somewhere else you don't feel that lack
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:47,616	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	You don't start getting scurvy because
EDL	00:40:49,152	00:40:51,712	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Feeding yourself on fruit and then
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:55,040	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That mutated Gene May then spread out and end up
EDL	00:40:55,040	00:40:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Being and every member of your species
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	What seems to happen to us I mean you can literally Lexi like these we have these broken vitamin C G
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:03,488	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So sometimes we trying to yeah
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:24,480	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay so there you have it a raw conversation with
EDL	00:41:24,480	00:41:26,528	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Science writer Carl Zimmer about
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,552	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shrinking
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:29,600	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Shrinkage in life
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	No usually would have these conversations
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:39,584	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Cuz you just talkin and cuz you don't really have like the encyclopedia sitting right next to you you get a lot of a little things wrong
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Deals with facts names dates whatever
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And then you know you fact check it later
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:50,080	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	So In fairness to Carl as we're fact-checking we gave him the chance to listen back to the raw conversation
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Make a couple of amendments
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,175	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This is fact Checker Carl
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:59,295	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Scolding rambling Karl
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:03,391	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay we were saying that
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:10,303	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This microbiologist Tim rowbotham took a sample to France but actually it was another microbiologist
EDL	00:42:10,303	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Turtles that did it
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Small but important sorry Richard
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	And Mama virus turns out to have a thousand 23g
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,663	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Then I started talking about virus
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	At the time in 2011 it was indeed
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,015	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The biggest virus known
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	1120 games
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:36,159	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay however there was in 2013
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:38,975	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A another virus found
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:44,607	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Called pandoravirus now I was saying that this was something found the temperature in tundra wrong
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:49,471	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This was on the ocean and this virus
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,007	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Has
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	A whole lot of jeans how many
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:54,847	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Ed has
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:43:00,735	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	2500 2500 I mean that's way more than a lot of bacteria
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Also a certain point in we to refer to Pandora viruses being the biggest virus in size
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,439	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I see that that stinks you go to
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Hippo virus
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:15,071	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	The house it seems that since we talked as evidence that there might be a couple separate
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,631	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Lineages of giant viruses
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:19,167	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	One may have evolved
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	From Big to small as we talked about but another one might have gone in the usual direction from small to big
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:32,223	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	There's one last thing that I see so apparently apparently I didn't quite spell metazoan correct
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:40,671	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	This is how you spell mixes on my xoz oan apparently I missed one of those
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:41,439	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I can't remember
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	I mean I would be lying if I said I didn't think a little bit less of you
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:52,191	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Okay xtro back in
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:58,335	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	Petco's in to Radiolab people interviewing stupid people
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:04,479	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's funny
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast15shrink |	That's a great taglines
