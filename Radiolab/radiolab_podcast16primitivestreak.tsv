EDL	00:00:03,072	00:00:03,840	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:08,192	00:00:11,520	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:16,640	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We're going to
EDL	00:00:21,248	00:00:26,112	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Starts with a conversation that I had with Jad a few weeks ago
EDL	00:00:26,112	00:00:27,136	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:32,256	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I like medical stories about you through this you know
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:34,560	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And so I read this website
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:36,096	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Cups that news.com
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Mariah is sort of really it's like a new weather Boston
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:44,544	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Collection of really amazing like medical reporters
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,824	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And
EDL	00:00:45,824	00:00:47,872	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I will click on surveys that look interesting
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And there was one about
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:52,224	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We've just grown embryos
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:55,296	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Human embryos for a long time in the lab and
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,600	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That was when I read the phrase
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:00,160	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The 14-day rule for the first time
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:01,440	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It was that
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:05,536	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Apparently there's this thing that you can't grow an embryo in a lab
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Pass 14 days
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Which I didn't even know you could grow in embryonal Abbott all right
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Or the people were
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,240	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Or that
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I mean I guess I knew IVF
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:22,688	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Happened sure like tattoo babies how long is the average IVF situation how long is an embryo in a dishwasher
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:28,320	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Then I realized I didn't actually even know that either so then I just spun out so like the whole article is just interesting to me cuz I was like
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I don't know about any of this
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Emily Webster this is radio from today on Radiolab
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I'm hole into another universe and Robert you're coming with me tell me about the universe
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You're going to want to buy a ticket because in this universe are twins and souls and mice and something called the
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:59,296	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Primitive streak and they're all gathered together around a certain rule
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Well you can fertilize an egg to get fertilized
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then the egg is fertilized egg it multiplies X cell divides so scientists could take it
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To watch it grow to learn about human development
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But then I have to stop
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Fa14
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That's the rule
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Is this a medical kind of thing or science
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Limitations Medical Science in there
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:28,992	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But philosophy and ethics
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:35,392	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Obviously religion and
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Shebang I have water
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I'll take a sip
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,792	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Okay are we going to begin with this guy Leroy Walters
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:46,400	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Okay he was an ethicist at Georgetown University now retired
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And to me he started the father of the 14-day rule
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I never thought of myself
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	As the father
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	14 day
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	He totally is well
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We shouldn't forget the context of
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	73
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Alright so 1973 Leroy has recently graduated with doctorate in ethics
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	From Yale University and he's settling into his job and it's a Time medicine and ethics
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Sort of Collision Course
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yes
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yes
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Good evening
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:27,360	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	January 8th 1973
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Happens is clearly
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That a
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,248	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Unborn
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Within the meaning of the Constitution but just six months after that decision be issued
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Go research became of Hot Topic
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Name of a testimony
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Even an instance of decapitating fetuses and then around the same time
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Guinea pigs the research involving human being
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Civil studies that were done on African American men without their knowledge
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Paralyzed without their informed
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Women with intellectual disabilities
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You have all these questions swirling about like
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:25,983	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	How we feel about the human body whether or not we want to experiment on it what are we protecting what don't we protect
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It just sort of this to Whirlwind and
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You are about to see a historic but most relevant for our story
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	July 25th 1978
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	UK wear now
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Incising the uterus itself
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Produced
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A child with the aid of in-vitro
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Fertilization
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The first baby that was born from an embryo that was grown inside of tube
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Babies not open her eyes yet
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Everyone in the World list
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	FastMed
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But there were people
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Who predicted Doom
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What was the Doom
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	In vitro fertilization would lead to
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Reproduction is
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Form of manufacturer
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So the government was grappling with
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We need more regulations or we need as a country to think about like what are ethical guidelines are
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The department of health education and Welfare
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Put together and then call the ethics Advisory Board
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Doctors Lehman academic
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Even a Jesuit priests who consider moral and ethical questions
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Human fertilization
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It's meetings and discussions open today
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Now as part of those meetings the Border colonies expert Witnesses and one of those Witnesses was our Boy Leroy
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Write the staff director Leroy like
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Ethically tell us what we should be thinking about when it comes to embryos we are to regard them
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And he says well there's a spectrum and on the one side You could argue human embryo should be
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Protected from the time of fertilization
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Forward
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We shouldn't even be growing embryos in a lab at all but then there's the other side
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Possession was that
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Research could be done until about 8 weeks fetus at about 8 weeks
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Can have a reflex
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Response
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To a stimulus
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	At some point
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,903	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A Committee Member turns to Leroy and she says
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Where would you draw the line
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A+
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	He says well
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I would say for me
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	14 days
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Y 14
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Well Leroy had a couple different arguments
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,079	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	1 before 14 days 50%
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Overly human embryos are simply
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Laughter
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They just sort of Shed from the woman's uterus
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And don't develop further if we are already losing 50% of them naturally
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We don't have strong moral obligation
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Toward early human embryo
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,791	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You can even posted as the
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Metaphysical
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The question
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	If these are important beings why do 50
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	8% of them
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Disappear
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And we never have any knowledge of
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Argument number two
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Splatoon 2
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	2
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	As in Twin embryos can recombine
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And a one embryo
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Right right before 14 days and embryo doesn't know if one embryo or vasectomy one person or two people
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So is leer I put it it doesn't have a
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:03,071	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And that happened around 14 days argument number 3
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,351	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The Primitives
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Streak
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Appears
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Primitive
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Streak the perimeters
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Is the
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	First indication of a
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,823	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	An axis
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Of the future body
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	People see it as I got the body starting to organize
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You might say it's
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The outline of the spinal cord that will develop later on the first hint of like
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Shape
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	All of those seem to kind of
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Converge
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Around
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	14 days
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Eventually the committee decides to take Leroy suggestion and recommend that all research on human embryos be stopped
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Get 14 days
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	With
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	High expectations
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Since we submitted the report
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,383	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The Secretary of health education and Welfare
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Joseph califano
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	On May 4th
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	1970s
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And on July 19th
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	1979 before he could be
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Respond
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Secretary kalifano was fired
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	By president
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Jimmy Carter
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It was part of a whole cabinet shake-up
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And so
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The report has been sitting on shelves
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Gathering
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Dust
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And there has never been
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	For Maurice
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It did end up becoming a guideline in the US It's actually an international guideline but we never actually needed it
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Because 14 days that was so far beyond
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The capacity of researchers
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The culture early embryos that it also seemed like
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Safe
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Safe
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Marker safe
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Foundry
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Because and this is the interesting thing with IVF
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We're familiar with 0 1 2 3 4 5
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	6
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Which is about the time they put the embryo into the mother
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So nobody is ever really seen how an embryo develops from day 7 through 14
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So interesting you can't
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,927	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Photograph it through the body for like various reasons
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	For one No One Ever Knows they're pregnant that are really like
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When did you and your wife realize your pregnant looks like a month after the fertilization
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah it's funny it's like when she ain't you even if you're trying you don't actually know for weeks until
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And it's so small that even if you did know the way it attaches to the uterus it start
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Burrows in and
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Kind of can't see it
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	At the same time scientists are pretty sure that this is a very important moment in development
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They just can't get to it
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Wait wait
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Life Magazine 50 years ago published these gorgeous pictures of
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Of a fertilized cell
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Beautiful little baby with eyes you just
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah but this is a that they have
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Pictures of sperms and eggs
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Then there's a blank spot until at least three and a half weeks
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So that Magazine spread
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Didn't show
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The first Pew II
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	In the development of the human being that no scientist has seen
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Ever know
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah so this is this kind of. Which in the textbook who would find described as a black box which
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Brings us
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The Magdalena at the University of Cambridge in UK
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Cheat for years have been trying to figure out how to grow embryos during this period
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But if we're Joseph Spider-Man the problem was at this point the embryo is beginning to attach
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To the mother's uterus and so just need certain things from the mother and if
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You try and grow it in
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A dish
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,719	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It just shrivels up and dies
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yes yes so that the time we were trying critias scratch our heads and come up with that Mustang
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Enrichment environment we could imagine
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Like maybe I can make a recreate that really warm cozy
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Home
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Put in a dish without the mom interesting so so experimented like what is the right
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Bath
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	At the growing embryo needs it needs
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:14,207	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah and they decided that while they're still trying to figure it out they would just do it on my sombreros first and Sochi
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Started essentially just
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Coming up with like chemistry concoctions
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They started with the gel which was of particular elasticity and then they
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Made from Human placentas added some hormones like progesterone along with fiber
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:40,063	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Escrow factors like someone would sell this is
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Looks like a face cream or something
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Play even tried serum from that's what I sent us that actually really didn't work.
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	For five years they put stuff in everything
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I ended up with something at least on my seem to work really well so they thought okay
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Maybe it's time we try this with human embryos
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We took two Andres just two human
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Blastocyst
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Put them in a dish with their chemical concoction and
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,831	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Amazing Grace
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,343	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It works
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	One of them
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Ditch maker
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	213 days
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The other one didn't but it's right
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Suddenly they have an embryo that was growing heffle into date
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Deny
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Big Ten
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,335	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	11
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And they were able to see all of these moments in human development that
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	No one had ever seen before
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,719	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And and guess what Robert
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I got to see them too
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Do you want to come of course I want to come okay good Alicia go right now I mean we are going to go
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But we're good actually have to take a break first
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So we'll be back in a bit
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Hi this is

EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And I request
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	For those of you who
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:40,895	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Aunts and uncles teachers we're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,455	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	How do they do that
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,647	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:55,231	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	If you have a story

EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:53,599	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Last we left you we had just met a woman who managed to grow a human embryo in a lab write up to the 14-day line
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Now we get to see it right after you promised
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,415	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yes

EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:09,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Lucky enough for me there is in embryology lab right here in New York Rockefeller University
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	How are you
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Run by this guy
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,663	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Fake being a scientist
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Ollie's team building off of magdalena's work
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Today we're also going human embryos in the lab
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The 40-day mark
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So he invited me up to see them seeing something that
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	No other human beings has ever seen
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Except the group in Islam
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And obviously might just laugh
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	How many people are in this lab that you think so.
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I think we're so total 25
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So then I'll be like 26
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So Ali has to step out of the room
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I'm excited but thank you Ali and he passes me off to the guy that runs like the human embryology
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You research at the lab
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Craft and a lab technician
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Chichirya Pellegrino
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To Julia Pellegrini
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Okay
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	We go into the lab
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Benches microscopes and people pipetting and
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	There's a little sticky on the fridge that says
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Experiment 27 embryos here
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Entity Leah pulls out like a plastic
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Box that has a blue bottom and like a white opaque top
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:24,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So they just came off and inside there was kind of like a microscope slide and the embryos were
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Attached to that
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	There's condensation on us we have to wait like 10 minutes
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Weirdly nerves but eventually they like look down into this like
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,951	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Little
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Square well
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	10 millimeters by 10 mm and I have a little bit of liquid in it
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:44,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then inside that liquid
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Offices
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Human embryo
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:54,687	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	How big is it how big is an embryo
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	In my mind I do imagine
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A tiny little
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Human isn't even human like at that point
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Tiny. Right there no is just a little white
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	.
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Really small
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I took a grain of sand
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And it looks like I kept also thinking that it look like if you took
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Sheet of typing paper and you took
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Pin
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Poked a hole in the paper and a little pinpoint of light came through
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That's what it looks like that
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I cannot believe that goes into a
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Five foot nine tall human being
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:37,183	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So that was a day 12 Andrea we were looking at with our naked eye but gets into chili also
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Badass microscope
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What do I don't want to break anything
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So we could look at a bunch of images and see the development of an embryo day by day
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Starting with
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Day 8
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Right here like you have the embryo man
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What are you
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What is it look like
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It's
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Tewksbury lunar 2
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Blown-out Grace
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Sphere that has like modeled surfaces
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But inside of it are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cells are primitive endoderm and there's a happy glass
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	There were like three different types of cells but to me it like looks like a simple structure
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	This is the same embryo the next looks totally different so starts to get a little more complex
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Now we can see nuclei there's a nucleus
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Make me switch from 9 to 10 so what are those
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Droplets now there are these like spiritual balls around the edges and that could be any number of things
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:41,951	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Just think they might be fat and the embryo it starts
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Warming like the asymmetry like you see things move to different areas of the cell
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Inside
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then your inner gut cavity that starts to form and solve
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A new cell type would never stand the yolk Sac Rebecca Graham cell
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So it's totally new type of cell no one's ever seen before so we don't know where it comes from and neither does anyone else
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Damn excited every time you open one of them locate a 11
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They'll abandon really like looks at different to me
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:27,775	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	School Daze thirteeners all this brightness at the bottom in the upper left-hand corner
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Remind me again the last is that is the cell type from which the entire body
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Eventually emerges
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Guest says those are the cells that all of the body comes from like all the other stuff is mostly just support
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So it's like that it's like the Primal like
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Primordial
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:56,703	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So actually got there on day 13 of the experiment so all of the embryos were just sort of
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Waiting to get today 14 and
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That was it
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then I was just sort of
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Spit back out into the real world
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Are they learning fantastically new amazing things based on this so they're like the the the big take
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Play the both of the groups had
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Why is that
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:21,792	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	This embryo glue for another week without any maternal input
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And it grew basically as it should have
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Which was mind-blowing to me into all of my colleagues
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That the human embryo
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Will behave in a self-organizing manner
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	In the complete absence of maternal input
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	At least for 14 days
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Like I think they always thought
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Even if they got the chemistry right there be some sort of system breakdown because it wasn't getting imp
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	From the mall
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Interesting ways I keep thinking of it is like the anti Mother's Day message
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Camera doesn't need you happy Mother's day but the edges the one pro promo
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Saying is by the way by the end
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	In between day like 12
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	14 and became
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Clear that it started meeting
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The Eternal Empire
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Well so they always cool was like they saw that the embryo start
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Deforming
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,880	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Tunnels and Pathways for the mom to like
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:24,512	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Infiltrate but there were little tubes and Pathways of foreign war like nerve attachment could happen
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And like circulation
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Sewage pipe repairs itself in this week
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The mom and the connection really cool it's like
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Play cooking itself up to the network
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I know it's funny as I coming online is like a human being
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The cool thing was
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Guess told me that right around Dayton along the edges of the embryo
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	This hormone shows up that your body had doesn't have before it's called like a gonadotropin
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Do you know when you take a pregnancy test
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The thing is reading is that hormone
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Is that
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	He thinks like
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The embryo Broadcasting
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Cyclone boom boom mic out to the rest of the body
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Like I'm here I'm here look at this hormone
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Wow that's super cool
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What is it like to look through a microscope and see
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Day 8
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When we've been stopped at day 7 since
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,720	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The 1970s or day 9 or 10
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It's hard to describe it
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When people receive
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The digital image of the Hubble telescope
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	First uri's
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Who are getting it in the screens
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:44,384	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I guess it has to be something but he seemed enough for that
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When I look inside
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,760	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	409a attorney at the time where
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,600	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Even exist
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Is the same as
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Looking at dimensions
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Never imagined
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Whatever see because we didn't even know they exist
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But then at day 14 you have
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To essentially embalming
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You like, I can make it stop growing and
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Freeze in the place it's at
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They caught fixing but if they wanted to we could they go past 14 days
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Maybe but
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:30,720	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Ali he said that as I got closer to day 14 they noticed
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,768	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Changes in the embryo that made it
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:36,608	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Clear that it started needing more than just a current Bassett it was in
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Okay
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Like embreeville Lou says it's 2 in Magdalena says it's like everyday feels like an accomplishment
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Oh my gosh I grew another day and then you start like
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Sharing it on
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Another day another day oh my gosh here to 12
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Becomes like your life
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Champion
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And then you're like
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Stop you're done and I felt like when I was standing there was like oh that's a bra
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Because
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,304	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I wanted it to grow grow grow grow grow
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But he said don't want it to grow grow grow too far
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So is like
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Curry 15 16 when does the joy of my voice stop
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Eventually
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That's uncomfortable this is something that
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,016	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Touches Us in The Roots
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Overtone definition
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So far being in existence and individuality
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Tecumseh like a Pandora box
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Yes you would open it but you have to be ready
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To see what's in it
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	If technology has no moved it a whole nother week so we can go for 14 days
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Maybe it's pretty soon you can go a whole nother week and then home other week
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Does that mean the rules going to have to change
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That is a conversation that's happening right now
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:03,648	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	This research was published there were commentaries and articles and columns
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Songs about what do we do about the 14-day Rule and there's
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Conferences are competent Boston that's happening in the fall
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Like you could choose
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Could do any number of things it depends on where you sort of throw down a biological or moral marker that you feel come
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Comfortable with like you can keep it at 14 days instead of keep it around like this idea of twinning and The Primitives
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You could move it a week out to say the day 21 when there's interesting sort of neural phone
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Folds in divisions that are starting to happen in the brain
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	You could go to 8 weeks
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	But it could also go back to zero
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	There's no consensus on the scientists are the first to say like
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They don't want to make this decision
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	They just think maybe we should have this conversation as a group so the
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Society decides not us
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So yeah and then we'll just like if you say that like this amazing is like the Hubble telescope how did it feel
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	When you're like I've gotten this far and now I have to end it
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So that's the toughest question you can ask me today
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	For me for sure
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Who was important
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	2
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Stop the experiment
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Where there was still a message that you could convey
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That would not offend people
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	This is more than just saying
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What is the
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	British an engine
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Reproductive biology especially in human reproductive biology
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	To make sure that you don't know fans
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,320	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	People sensitive
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Identity dignity
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,416	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Religion
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:43,744	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So Ali he finds himself
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:47,328	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Trying to keep all of these different perspectives in his head
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,608	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	All at once
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So. Lifted the Catholic point of view is
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:56,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Human Origins perception then I have to respect also the Jewish point of view
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	That's just you know what is a harpy
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Also
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Respect the Muslim point of view about the origin of human life
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Which surprisingly for one seems to be similar than the Jewish point of view is also heart piece
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I wish I could respect the Buddhist point of view
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And what about the Hindus
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	The booty says if you don't cut the umbilical cord when you're not independent you're not a human being called an organic human being
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Asian deuces
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I don't know what you guys are talking about
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	There is no
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Origin or ends
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What are circles within circles within circles
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	On the butterfly today
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I'm going to die and come back as a tiger I'm going to die and come back as a human then come back
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What origin
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,136	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	A circle does not have an origin
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	2
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I am for the progress of science
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I am four
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,792	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Gaining knowledge is my job
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,072	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	It's the way I'm wired
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	As a human being I said his final sense of curiosity
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,728	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	And there's nothing more to use to me tomorrow Norwich
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:03,360	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	So then that would be like you would love to know like what happens on day 21
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Absolutely and
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	I like to think that
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Before I die
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	Who would know
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast16primitivestreak |	What happens on day 21
