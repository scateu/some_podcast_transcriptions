EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:23,552	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hi I'm Robert krulwich I Molly Webster Radiolab and today
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:27,904	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We've got breaking news Robert krulwich
EDL	00:00:27,904	00:00:32,768	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Drake this is something we've never done before never done before what does anybody know about this yet
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:35,840	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Well it is a new bit of research is being published today
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:37,632	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We've known about it for the last few months
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:39,680	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	But we haven't been able to talk about it
EDL	00:00:40,448	00:00:41,984	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What's this thing about
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:44,544	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So is this is a discovery about Alzheimer's
EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:45,056	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Disease
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,872	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which I think at this point is something that affects
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Basically every family
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:51,712	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Affected my family
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:53,248	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And this is
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	A discovery that is not a cure but it's
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Basically about looking at the brain
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which is one of the most complicated things in the universe I thing
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And poking at it in this super simple way
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,864	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And getting
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:10,144	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Desposar results
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,168	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	How is your car
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:13,984	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Pretty bizarre
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:15,520	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hello
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,544	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hello hello
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hi Molly hi how are you alright so last night I was talking to some folks over at the brain Institute at M
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	A mighty and while I was on the phone with them they started telling me about some research that had been published
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:29,600	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It was all very
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Oshkosh
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Be cool though we ended up
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Defining to sign a non-disclosure agreement
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And it was based on the work of this woman Lee Wei Tile
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The weight I sigh
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Ty I'm a professor and the director of The picower Institute for learning am I
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Memory at MIT
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Holy crap you're a director
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	How do you have time to do all that that's a good question she is like a badass is what she is
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Buy this is the piece of work and I'm very proud of
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,344	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I'm very excited about
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Okay cool so Amy's eliminate let me begin okay so historically people work on Alzheimer's
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Really
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I would say generally when you talk to researchers about Alzheimer's disease
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They either focus on individual genetic factors
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The genetics of the disease so that
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Jeans that
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Predispose you maybe to alzheimer's the brain chemistry and how Alzheimer's affects
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,992	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Chemicals in the brain molecular
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Pathological features do my conversation with leeway
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	She was talking about something totally different sort of look at it from a different angle
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Ignore work all centers around something called
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The gamma frequency
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:49,216	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The gamma gamma and what is Battlestar
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I don't think it's that
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You could think of it as a particular
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,432	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Beat
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In your brain
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	A beat in the brain
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yeah which means what exactly
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Well just to oversimplify one of the most complicated things in the known universe
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,000	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Got your brain
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Full of neurons which are a certain type of brain cells we have
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Billions of neurons in the brain they have you
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Long tentacles that are reaching out
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Towards other neurons
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And for the brain to function neurons have to communicate with each other to process information and the way
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,176	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Way they do that is
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They fire
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yes
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	An electrical signal will go through them in a like that
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Another neuron it'll turn it on and then it'll like an electrical signal will go through it and then
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Turn it on but the cool thing is is that when your brain is doing things like making you move
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Write a poem or think great thoughts
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Groups of neurons fire in sync all together on the same
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Beat
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And there's a bunch of different Pizza happen in the brain
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:02,176	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Some of them are slow like one beat per second and that's
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	When you're sleeping
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	If you're beating around 10 beats per second like maybe you're sitting next to a campfire in an Adirondack chair
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Chair
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Or unless I totally other end of the spectrum
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Like some neurons fire at 600 Beats
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Per second or do they do or die that I have no idea. All this is going on in your head simultaneously yeah
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The cool thing is that when
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	All of these beats in your brain come together that's when you're able to
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Process the world
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And understand it as it exists
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is human being
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	But getting back to our story
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	When your brain is doing something really tricky that requires super focused attention working
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Memory and and so on trying to find your way
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Home from the subway station or if you're in a new city you don't navigate around it there's a certain beat
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It sort of rises above them all and that is but so cold gamma frequency
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This range between 30 beats per second all the way up to a hundred feet per second and is gamma frequency has been
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Consider to be very important for the higher-order
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Cognitive function and the interesting thing is that when you look at an Alzheimer's brain what you see
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	There's actually less gamma happening or people say like the power of gamma is reduced
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:33,311	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Has can be recruited to oscillate at the gamma frequency it's still there
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Quieter
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Thank you turn the volume down right
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,039	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Isos just a briefly some up here what we've got is a rhythm which we call gamma
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which is used when we have
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Complicated are higher thoughts in the brain
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which one you got Alzheimer's
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Kind of gets
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Saggy
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So tired of course
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Obviously in an Alzheimer's brain there's a lot going on in this is just one of the things
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Right you got the plaque buildup around the neurons the stuff that
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Except your brain and makes it hard to think
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The cobwebs in the brain
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then the connections between neurons gets all muddy heated immune cells get messed up but I was like
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Forget all that
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What would happen if I just bring the gamma back yeah
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We decided
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,695	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	To just manipulate
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Gamma oscillations
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:28,351	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	How do you how do you do that
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Well
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hello hello hello hello hello
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Technology hi this is Molly hi hi hi
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Technology you can find at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And actually I went took a train up to Boston at MIT not too long ago
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It's a
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Big Shiny glass building
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Eventually lose weight I came striding into her office to meet me
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What you want to see
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And Toby way let me down the hall to this tiny room
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Brought in these
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Adorable little myself my gosh they're like little black
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Can soft and furry
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Ears are
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Tags little metal tag
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So here's what they did
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I get some ice we started all please a mouse model not the mice I actually got all excited over but my city
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Early stage of Alzheimer's disease
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Swissmar Depot notable defects
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Do they have the Donkey
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:36,447	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Black stuff in them yet or is that later but they do have elevated levels of
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Peptide switches this protein that forms the plaque
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So it's like basically black gunk
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	But the important thing to lose weight on your team is that they have less gamma going on in their brain
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	If you remember the whole plan here is
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	To bring the gamma back yes
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	To do that
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,439	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They get what might be the worlds
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Can I use drill and a drill a small hole
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Into the skull of the mouse
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then they take a really thin fiber optic cable they slide it through the hole into the brain
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then they get the Blazer of blue light to flicker
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	40 beats per second yeah my frequency and they turn that on in the light travels down the fiber optic cable deep down into the brain
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This group of cells that they modify
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In the hippocampus
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	To be sensitive to light
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So when the pulsing light hippie sells they actually began to fire at 40 beats per second
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	A gamma frequency
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	When our
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hiring and firing and firing and hiring and firing then
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	After 1 hour they turn off the light and then eventually they started looking at the the brains of these mice
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Trying to figure out if anything was different
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	After the light flash
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And they see
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	2 armat surprise
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We're not expecting this at all we found
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	After they shop is pulsing light into the brain there was
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Suddenly nearly
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Half as much
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	That soon-to-be nasty black Gunk stuff
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	That was filling up
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Half of the stuff was just Swept Away yes
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	40 to 50% reduction of beta-amyloid that just seems
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This is crazy I mean
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We were just so surprised
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Do they know why
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Why the flu turn out
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The pulsing light somehow triggered the brain's clean up crew
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:30,623	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Microglia the cells in the brain that are called microglia you can say they're the janitors of the brain
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:34,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Normal brain these janitor cells usually gobble up a gum
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Spot
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In Alzheimer disease
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It's known that Michael gliadin.
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They don't serve the function normally anymore
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I'd like these janitors just sort of
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Stop
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Cuttin Up
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And go on strike
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Fairy
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Okay so we're looking at a screen that's now
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Flat it's not not the one I was at a mighty one of leeway is grad students my name is Anthony Moore
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Martorell
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Boys showing me side-by-side comparisons of the mice brains on the screen
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The green things microglia
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And you see after 1 hour
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Of gamma wow
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The microglia the cell
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Themes
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	A lot bigger clearly see these round
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Bodies
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And also the belly
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Sims will have more amyloid
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Oh like you're doing more eating
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yes they go back to eat more amyloid again it's like somehow making the neurons fire turned on the
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Sanitation system in the brain
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The most
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Wild
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Results with there's more wild oh my God you got to hear this because what I'm about to tell you
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You may say no I don't believe it it's science fiction
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Okay
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So one of the things leeway in her team were starting to think was that
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Drilling in fiber optic cable
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Very invasive right you never be able to do that on
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:58,943	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Human exact
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So we started to say well
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What if we can get the light
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Into the brain
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In a different way like maybe
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We could go through
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The eyes
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Tony the hole in your head would be your eyes instead of a hole in your head
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So we way and her team created what I like to think of as
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The flicker room
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What is the real
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This is a room and I visited is just a storage closet you know you have a
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What is this
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Just like
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The table fairy DIY it's a plastic table you can buy at Target there was some plastic shoe
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Box size containers lined up on the table for the mice
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then go see the strip
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Around the edge of the table basically surrounding all the
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Are duct tape
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Strips of LED lights
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:51,423	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And other reason or use LED this because a regular light bulb
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Can't flash fast
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Intellij idea is what if we just
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Put the mice in this room and just let the light flicker
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,359	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	At 40 Beats
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	4 seconds to show Molly like attorney
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yeah
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And so we turn off the overhead light in the room
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So it's very black and then
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Oh wow
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The room was now glowing with this white LED light
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Peso the light is
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Turning on North
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	20 * 2
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It is so there's not you not you don't see anything going like on or off
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I just looks like something on but it kind of feels like my
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	My eye is twitching
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And so is blurring the the Blurred the Lytle
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Just on the edges
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:33,919	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	On the edges when do they put mice in this room for an hour and just let them kind of Bays
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Bathe in this in this glow and guess what
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What we look at
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The amyloid-beta levels
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In the visual cortex
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,927	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And we found
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	There is a 50
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	50% 50%.
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Weasley didn't they didn't
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:13:01,567	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Do any Drilling in their stalls or anything so they didn't have to be sensitive to light
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I filled the room with occasional LEDs flashing at a particular frequency for an hour
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Are you going to tell me I don't believe it is
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Science fiction
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And they followed the study up with another study which was done in the same way so are the same flicker room light through the eye
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Highballs and only this time they put the mice in there for one hour day for 7 days
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And they took my SAT had full-blown Alzheimer
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So this is like
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Cognitive decline they're forgetting things and they've got hardened plaques in their brain
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They say the same thing nearly
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,943	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Half of the stuff
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Was cleared away
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Half
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Flickering light
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	In front of them
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,719	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	That's the shot I mean that's the shocking thing
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:54,047	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The thing I didn't understand after talking to you about your study was I was like
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Why hasn't everyone done this before like why didn't everyone go we should just shine light through eyes
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,959	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Will you know that's
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It's really the most unexpected and exciting as back
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Or study
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Peaches
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Something this simple
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yet
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You know it has never been done before
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	One of the things at one of the caveat here
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is that if you don't do the flicker Lite room every 24 hours a level of gunk in the brain starts going back
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:25,023	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Back up again and so now they're trying to figure out how they
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Keep those levels
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Down maybe the fur good
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	If
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	V
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Mouse no longer has quite as much
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,215	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Junking is he
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Does that mean that it can
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Remember things that
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Happened to it
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yeah that is
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	There
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,527	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They don't know that's what they're too that is now.
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Next Step but nobody really understands how
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Plaques and the gunk buildup in the brain relates to memory and key
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Cognition
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:58,815	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The Dogma in the field is that when you have Alzheimer's
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You can't form
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	New memories and once you lose the memory it's gone for good
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	But there is another group at MIT that is actually
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Thrift challenging that assumption that
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You can never get a memory back cuz the person could never tell us
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We all assume that the information have to be gone
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	All really
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And we'll get to them

EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,919	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Did you know did something
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,703	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Well
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Started reading
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Back to you
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Or maybe the kids in math
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Taking the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Kid does something super smart
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	If you have a story
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Go to radiolab.org

EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,383	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,255	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I'm rubber clovece Molly Webster
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is Radiolab more back and just before the break you said that
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	There may be a way
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	To bring a memory back
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Holding me back
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:17,055	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Team to be in the play
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Wide why are we so quick to jump to the conclusion that the information was somehow completely gone
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And the person who said that to me is this guy
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Something else
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Over at the town of Growlithe they were thinking
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	What if we could figure out eggs
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Exactly where the memory should be in the brain
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I just give that spot a little bit of juice
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So they took some ways that were just starting to lose their ability to remember things and they thought okay let's try to give them a memory
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Meet them in a box that has a particular smell some sort of lighting and some texture on their feet a little mouse
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Carpenter
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The point is the Box looks and feels and smells different than any other box they would hang out in
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then give them a light electrical shock
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And the mice
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They just freeze
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They don't move at all which is a sign that they're afraid
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,583	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The Heat
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:19,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And for the rest of the afternoon which is very long time and mouse time they go on hating the Box
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Which means
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	With the carpet in the light in the smell if you put it back in there it'll
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Breeze
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,151	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Because it remembers
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yes
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	But
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Day or week later when the same lights are put back into the same box
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Still just continue investigating as if nothing happened
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The cannot remember
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So did Raj and his team did with leeway did they got some modified mice and then it put a little hole in their head
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Slit in a fight Rock
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Optic cable they shine some light
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Trick of the neurons if they think
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Hold this memory
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And they were
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Near the fear section so leading on the path to the fear section
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So we do this
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And then
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Put them back into box the box with a particular lighting and smell in carpet
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is there any change in their behavior
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Will they act afraid again
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Do they show any more memory
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And they did
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Shut up if they actually were scared of the boxing
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	They showed recovered memory
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Best memories in there
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Exactly
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Behaviors back
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You can dig up the memory by
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Shining Light in the right place
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:41,439	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I was always under the impression that their memories were totally lost
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Just do it
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Essentially the entire field
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	That's good because the patient could never tell us
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	We all assumed the information have to be gone
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So one of the things to say is that deraj did tell me that you know all of this
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The experiments they did are in
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Mice that have early Alzheimer's
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Are the Saudis so is that once you get to the late stage of the disease there's enough damage in the brain that you really wouldn't be able
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	How to get those memories
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is back
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	That might
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Be right
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,927	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Other memory loss
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Distrust
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Lost but you know when you
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:18,815	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	When you have someone in your house
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And you are
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Can you live with this disease day in and day out
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The disease
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Just
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Goes its own way and
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Puzzleyou or
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Writing you or
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,967	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I believe the clear something new that you didn't expect
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	So for example my dad had it for about
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	19 years
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Slow
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Active disappearing Heat
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Wearing the last
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Time my father
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Team
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	2
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Was so far into the disease
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,399	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	He hasn't spoken
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	For year-and-a-half
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	He was sitting at the table for the Passover Seder
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And there's a song that you saying
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Panagos die die die die
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Dino Dino Dino Dino
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Decorous
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	End
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	From out of nowhere
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Being
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	At the end of the table who I knew was my father who hadn't spoken in a year and a half or two and have not spoken
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Coherently
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:22,816	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	3
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Suddenly
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Blue into the song
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	And sang the song
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Full-throated lie at the table
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Like
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The reappearance of some just last
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,248	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Figment of himself
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	It was both horrifying
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Extraordinary
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:59,680	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The fact that maybe some information still persists hopefully someday we could maybe that's something we could do
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:02,752	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Solo
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:07,616	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	My mind at the moment
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:12,480	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	As long as we can figure out
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	How to reboot
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The pathway to retrieve the memory then I think there is
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	This is the way tie again but
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:26,560	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You know I I personally think the most important question is
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Whether humans were
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Respond
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Similarly
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	I mean keep in mind that both
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Daraja study and leeway ties are in mice not humans
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Right so I do have a spot that like why I like
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,712	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	Is there a reason that a human neuron might react differently than a mouse
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	The thing is I sing especially you know in all timers field I mean people got burned a lot
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	You know there's like I-99
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast16bringinggammaback |	.6% failure rate in moving something that seemed to work in mice to humans
