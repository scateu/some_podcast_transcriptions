EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I've been falling pretty much my entire career Radiolab
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You can have to run back 1977 SS not when I started
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Following story that's when the story itself started

EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Out there

EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I spoke with an e and we made the story you're about to hear
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Visit Annie at her home Ithaca
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	New York and we sat in the backyard near waterfall
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	In the same spot she says where Carl himself would say
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Right
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Next time my name is Annie Drury Inn

EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Message project
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Which began in
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Early 1977
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Come about
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I think about the project now and
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And so
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Exciting to think about I mean it's such a romantic idea did you know that at the time
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Absolutely felt
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	First of all that this was a kind of
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:03,871	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Sacred
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Trust
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Bad here we were
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Half a dozen very flawed human being
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Wave that you just huge
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Building
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Cultural
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Noah's Ark
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It was a chance to tell something
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What life on Earth was like
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Two beings of perhaps
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A thousand million years from now
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Because they
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The Voyager Engineers were saying This Record will have a shelf life
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A billion years
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That didn't race
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Goosebumps when you have to be made of wood
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I was also the but the
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,135	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And here we were
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Taking on this method
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Challenge
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:54,047	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And knowing
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It before it was John
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Two spacecraft
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Would lift off from the planet Earth
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Moving at an average speed of
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,031	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	35000 miles an hour
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	For the next thousand million years
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And on it would be a kiss
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A mother's first words to her newborn baby
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Beto
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Greetings in the 59 most
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Populist

EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Planet Earth
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	As well as one Nan Yuan language did
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Waiting for the humpback whale
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And it was a sacred Undertaker
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Because it was saying
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,807	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We want to be citizens of the cosmos
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I want you to know about that
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Tell me what the mummy found love with Carl Sagan you said it was during the Voyager compilation
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Yes it was it was June 1st 1977 I've been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Take that we could put on the Voyager record and not feel like an idiot for having done so and done
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I was very excited because I finally
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Found a ethnomusicologist composer at Columbia University
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Who told me without a moment's hesitation
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That this peace flowing streams
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,911	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Which
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A Chinese music 2500 years old
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What's the piece we should put on the record
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,663	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So I called
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Carl Lewis
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Traveling
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	He was in Tucson Arizona giving a talk
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And done we've been alone many times
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	During the making

EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Said anything to the other we're both in popular people
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We had a wonderful

EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But

EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I can still remember it so
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Perfectly
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I said
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	For Keeps
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Did he said you mean get married
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I said yes
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,527	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And you know
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Even have any other kind of personal discussion before
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We both hang up the phone
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I did
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Read out loud I remember it
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So well cuz it was his great
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,303	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Eureka moment
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It was just like a scientific discovery
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And then the phone rang and I was thinking phone
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It was Carla he's actually make sure that really happened we're getting married right
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I said yeah we're getting married he said okay
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,199	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Just wanted to make sure
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And done
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and August
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	XXII
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Told everyone involved and we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 in December
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Wow romantic obviously
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brain wave
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	My heart my eyes everything in that meditation on the record
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I have Carl whether or not would be possible to
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Compressed
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:09,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The impulses in one's brain and nervous system
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Into
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Sound and then
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Put that sound on the record and then
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I think that perhaps the Extra-Terrestrial
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Of the future would be able to reconstitute
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Data into thought
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And he looked at me
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Beautiful
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	May Day in New York City and said well you know
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Thousand million years is a long time you know why don't you go do it because who knows you know who knows with
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	About twenty thousand million years
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And so on
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	My brain waves and REM every little sound that my body was making with
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:52,031	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	This was two days after
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Carlin die
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Declared our love for each other and so
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now it does somebody flags that record an and
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I always wondered because part of what I was thinking in this meditation
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Was about The Wonder of love and of being in love
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And you know it's on those two spacecraft
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Goodnow inmate whenever I'm down
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Yeah I'm thinking it's still they move 35000 miles an hour
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Leaving our solar system
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	For the Great Wide Open see if Interstellar space
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Billions of years from now the sun will it reduced this planet to a charred Ashleigh Ball
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:50,143	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That record with Androids brain waves and heartbeat on it will still be out there somewhere in tact
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's a remote region of the Milky Way preserving a murmur
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Ancient civilization that once flourished
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	On a distant planet
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,831	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That's how we ended the original story
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It helps to BRC the 40th anniversary of the Voyager probes launched
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Between the two dates were Pro one pro tour launched it's a weird thing about the anniversary and
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A Preacher Man around chick called up and running again and they got to talking about the fact that we still
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Scientists are still talking to those probes that's the thing that gets me
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Here we are 40 years later
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Are we still in contact with Voyager 1
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We still know
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We born to run into our
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We were able to build something
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So well
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Deputy energy
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Which is essentially
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Morphe people
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Any energy in a
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Toaster
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We can communicate
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Voyager
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	As she leaves to wander the Milky Way galaxy
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Intact
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	With a message intact well
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The same engineers said it would work
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Forgotten years is 40 years and it still work
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So coming up we're going to ask
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Where are they at
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Where specifically are those two probes
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Now and the answer is
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	They're in a very
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,071	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Very very undiscovered play
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	EBay
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I learning things
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That we have never known
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Skyways riding talk to you
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Angleton sunbeams ride downtown
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Play this is Becca I'm calling from Dallas Texas to let you know that radio
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Do you like it supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	More information about Sloan at www.smud.org
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:17,343	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teacher
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:42,175	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:48,831	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	A kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	If you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Go to radiolab.org brilliance
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Record short audio message
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich is Radiolab and now we're going to ask where are those Voyager probes
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,191	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Right now this is a story with bun
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Falling forever in about 5 years ago
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Producer Lynn Levy
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Begin to ask yourself that question where are they because at that point
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,687	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	News was starting to Bubble Up
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That the that the Voyager probes
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We're about to tiptoe their way up
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Cross a truly amazing
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Threshold
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And at that moment it wasn't completely clear what was
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,535	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So here's what we reported them
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We're going to break in a certain point in update things even further but
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Lynn began this story where the last one left.
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Okay so would like in the point of the mission wasn't really to deliver this record it was to go out and look at
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	All the planets in the outer solar system
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:21,759	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So starting in 1977 these two little spaceships to spacecraft
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Voyager 1 and 2 went racing away from Earth snapping pictures
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And so every time
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Where should we reach another planet
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You know all of the Voyager people would get together
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Going to the Imaging room and see the pictures
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Come from the outer solar
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Do you remember seeing them
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I remember the child saying Life magazine in Iowa
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	7
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:45,567	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Voyager was launched
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	This is me.
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Professor at Boston University as a grown up she became part of the Voyager team
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	All the pictures
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But you know as a kid
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You look at the books in to see what how Neptune look
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Revelations
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Saturn the image of Saturn taxicaller I like pink and reddish turquoise color
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Yellow nose ring
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Just
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,935	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Spectacular
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	They could see active volcanoes on one of the moons of Jupiter
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Finally that vision of Neptune like a blue juul
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Really blue
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's all
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Came from voyage
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We have no idea how they look like
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Neptune was the last
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Big cool planet and it was the last thing they were
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Photograph
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	After that the camels were going to be shut off
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	To save energy
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Carl Sagan convince them
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Turn on Voyager back door
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And take a final picture
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So on Valentine's Day 1990
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	One of the ships
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Luly Rocha
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's it was facing back
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:51,103	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Earth
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It snapped a picture
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	One last picture
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Describe
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Mostly empty
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Pretty dark
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You can see certain streaks of light
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Coming from the Sun
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:12,607	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And then
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You honestly wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out to you but down in one corner
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Kind of a suspended in a Sunbeam the ways of very small. Blue
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Pale blue dot
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That was us
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	In Carl Sagan's words
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:31,295	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Everyone you ever knew everyone you ever loved
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Every superstar
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Every corrupt politician
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Everyone in all of history everything the sum total think of the river
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So that one indistinguishable group could
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Have momentary domination over
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Fraction of that Pixel It was one of those really rare
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:02,271	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Images every single day I'm here from people who take that pale blue dot
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So deeply to Heart
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What to do with a complete reframing
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	After that
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The, what sound off
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Bishop's kept going
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Drifting through the darkness
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Even though they weren't taking pictures anymore they were using like their other senses little instruments that
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Text like how many particles are around what the temperature is so they were hurtling through this empty space really fast
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Measuring
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Sending that data back
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And scientists like that off with their listening
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	For what
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Was not clear but they knew at some point these capsules would get to the edge
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The edge of what the solar system
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The solar system has a big spider has an edge it's a it's like a bubble
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Sean has a wind every start of the wind but the sun has its own wind
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It blows out through the solar system can be between 402
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	All the planets and
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Keeps everything else out
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So these little things are cruising out towards the
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Edge wherever it is scientist don't quite know where it is or what it is
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Because the control room or like Panama shift like hey what's
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What's up what do you see
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Nothing
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	How about now
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Not much
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	How long before the X
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	14 years
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Oh man that's like driving
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Kansas
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But like a million times worse.
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	There Comes a Day end of 2004
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Where
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	They stop listening for a little while because the antenna and that's only has so many antennas Matthews into listen to everything
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So for a little while the boys are teams like okay you guys over there can use the antennas we're going to lunch
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's been 14 God damn near knocked yourself out at school
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And they come back few hours later start listening again
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Happened very sudden everything is totally changed all of a sudden boom speed of the wind
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Drop them around 380 count to a hundred
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Instantly I just all-in-ones density and then everything out there started to get
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:35,104	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Poland
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And before
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Articles also behaving a very different way
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And the fields are very
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	We are
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The fields and magnetic field
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So just like the sun has a wind system has a magnetic field as well the field starts at the Sun and then curves out in this
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Kind of graceful Arc through the solar system rotates
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,360	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Create what people called by levinas
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Cart
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You know how like a skirt with a flare if you spin around real fast that's
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,248	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Apparently kind of what this
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Field looks like
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Way out there
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It seemed like a skirt
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Started
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Freddy
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Maybe tear a little
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Threads
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:25,536	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Broken often seem to be floating around on their own not connected to anything
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What is this song
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Fields are breaking down in
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The wind is dying down inside the wind is what exit
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Create the space solar system
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	This mean we're out to know
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I kind of thought that was always happy
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But no
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's not out
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And it's not
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Quite in
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's in the
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Edge of the bubble
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	India but it's not like
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's a thick
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The catch the edge isn't just a little line that you cross
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,536	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Place
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:02,400	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And while we listen to the to Voyager ships moved through this Edge
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	For several years
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Then something very interesting happen that the wind on which one
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Stop
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Lie completely stopped
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Yeah
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So now we're out no no
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I mean this is what people thought
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But the other measurements like temperature and number of particles
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,304	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Text field doesn't tell us
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Nature surprise.
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Again
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So now we think there's a place at the edge of our solar
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Customized at the edge
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Shove the edge
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Utterly still no wind at all
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Pause
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	People Akinator
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Stagnation layer
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:50,784	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And there is a big discussion why this layer exists
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And housing
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And by how thick it is she means
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	When will it end
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Because
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Once we get past this so is anything ever crossed
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The Foundry Buffet
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	No this will be the
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	First man-made object
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	To leave
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,680	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Any Star
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And the voyage was like right there smiling touching that Bounder
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You know you only do those things
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	First one
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Like your first
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Your first taste of alcohol
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Your first time driving a car
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	First time you see the ocean
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Open up a whole new world
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Going to freaking app
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It might have happened while we were talking that was thinking from now any moment now next
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Capital Moses
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Or 3 years from now
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's closed
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Everyday open my Google alert for Voyager and I look and see
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:52,736	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Did happen today before the show goes out of me pissed yeah everyday
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The first thing you do in the morning
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Like the Thursday
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	He left that story at that point five years ago it seemed like the Voyager probes were in this
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Weird
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Liminal space
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Kind of stuck somewhere in the edge
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Of the edge
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Of our planetary neighborhood
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Transition moment
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Could happen at any time that's where we left it
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Which seemed honestly kind of frustrating like we did the story too soon
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,136	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You know what that happens every so often
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So we decided to call merav opher back
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	She's a scientist you were in the story who is part of the Voyager team
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	To pick up the story like what happened
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Okay so since then we will waiting right and his stories is
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Fascinating and a little complicated to
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Because this was back
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	In 2012
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Right Jesus shortly after our story was released couple of months later
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So was in August on August 2012 but six months after
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Name
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Particles this was
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Fascinating the energetic particles
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	From the Sun
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Dropped
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:12,352	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Some people thought out no sun particles that must mean we're out
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Couple of days later they came back
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And then there was the same test as before
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And then they dropped again
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's almost failed that somebody had to open a window
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I close a window and then open a window and window so was kind of weird
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Spectre classic Crossing
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It should be sudden it should be all you're in or you're out you don't have this intermediate
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I mean I'm out that mean I'm out I saw so this was not the classic textbook and was very
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Women like Ayo what's going on
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And there was very heated discussions because
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You know you're waiting to say to the public are we really cross the solar system for the first time or not
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And we can Jose
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,504	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Super frustrating scientist started arguing
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Me there's a bunch of conferences and meetings where they got together and the scientist essentially broke into faction
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,672	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	One faction
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It was like we are out
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,000	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Another faction was like no
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Where in
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And she says it one of those meetings
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:21,472	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	There was a vote are we in or are we out and and I and I just felt this is crazy this is such a mess
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Major
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	My stone exactly
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Did we really arrived to America's evolved
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And it was just crazy they did vote and the vote
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,112	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Was still well inside
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:42,208	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So towards the end of 2012 that's what they thought we're still in
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Something change and and the something is a sound we were hearing
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Around the time these arguments the Voyager with sending back
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Sound doesn't have a lot of energy on board
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So they have a tape recorder
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Soon as a tape recorder
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Really yes
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I think it's a 8-track
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Janus Inc
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It turns out it's true that there are eight tracks on both of the probes
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	They're capturing ultra-low frequency plasma
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	223 kilos
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But you can actually hear
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,840	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Now that whoosh
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That is just a background of the power supplier of the Voyager itself idling basic
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Cruising through empty space
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But she says when you go to the following recording
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	This what you're about to hear is 8 months of time
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	From late 2012 into 2013 8 months
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Collapse into a tiny clip
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What you hear are these little swells
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	There's one
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	You have
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,704	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Those ramps
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:00,544	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Leavittsburg it's kind of confusing the Ascension Rob says those swells
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That's the Voyager spacecraft
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Colliding with some new
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Galactic stuff
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So you're hearing
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It was a ramp of density as you go into Interstellar space
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I thought that those sounds one of those two sounds
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:23,840	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Is the Voyager bursting out of our solar system but she told me no no
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,376	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What it is
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What is the sound of the Voyager already on the other side
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The boys are basically saying I'm in a new space now
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	After some analysis in this part I cannot explain
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	NASA pinpointed the ejection moment
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Crossover moment
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	To just
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Before
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The first of those two swells
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Took this is the first well
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Just before that
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Right there
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Migrate
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That's when we left
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	It's so undramatic
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:04,032	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	But we finally escaped
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Official exit date 25th of August of 2012
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Always ready to talk to you
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:22,208	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The sunbeams ride Helena
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	So now we have a
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Human manufacturer
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That has left
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	The sphere of the Sun
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	On the other side in the other ocean
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Is like I am
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I don't know it's a Bittersweet till to see all this incredible data
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,760	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	That Voyager is giving us
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	And I want more I would like another mission there. Looks like somebody to give you like a taste
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Look how interesting this day that he's in poop
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	They're leaving
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:31:01,120	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Speaking of leaving merab says that we can expect to communicate with the Voyager probes for
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Another age 10 years but then
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Eventually they will lose power
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Endodontic
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	Recording
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	What time is it 11:33
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17voyagerupdate |	I'm already getting close
