EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Eyes in the sky
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	In the situation we left it is at mnuchin one of our producers and emails have gone down to Dayton Ohio to talk with Ross McNutt
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Check out his technology
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	How are you feeling
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I was feeling like
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	You have not convinced me I do I am not
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then I saw was Max
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And that
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Well
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I mean that's what made me start to think otherwise
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Where is especially the time we did this the average
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,239	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	300 murders a month
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	52 kidnappings a week
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	300 murders a month
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	McNutt the gang they got a contract we've been asked not to say
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	For home
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:56,319	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they went down south set themselves up in a hotel room got the plane up in the sky and then whoever the
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Client was started bringing them crime reports
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So this is kind of what you never want to see happen but
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This is kind of why the system was up
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Alex pulled up on the screen is very grainy aerial shot of Juarez
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This is where is Mecca
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It looks like
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Right you've got like grids of streets
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Cars and houses and then like over on the left of the screen
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Key points to this dark little square
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The vehicle
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's going down the
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This is a female police officer she was X
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Headed to work
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	On this morning
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	All kind of go through it here
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	There's her house
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Your car is parked outside
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	You see that like
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Noodle pixel gets in her car
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	She pulls out of her driveway that was her home starts to drive to work
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then right when
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,359	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	She leaves
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	If you look up here in the upper left
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Several cars were parked
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Up on the corner
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Soon as you left your driveway those cars be
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Become active
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So this is a Stakeout
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Yeah they were waiting for her to leave
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,559	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	He's so zoomed in that you can see it's like a Tic Tac
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Moving down the street
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then two more Tic Tacs come alongside
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Until they get right about here looking forward on the photo and you see
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	These cars just inch closer
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	What kind of hesitate there which is
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Unfortunate
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So she's driving down the street
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And there's these cars following behind her
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	There's this car up ahead of her
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	A vehicle that had been
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I'm parked here for
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	15 20 30 minutes
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	All the sudden
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Backs out into traffic
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And seemingly slows them down almost gets in an accident right here
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Which gives these guys
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Enough time
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To catch up
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This is where they
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Pull up beside her
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:59,711	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Alex says
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Right there this is the point
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Where the first car pulls up and shoots her multiple times she was shot in the head multiple times in the head right
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Right here
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	She's actually going to roll through the intersection
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Her car continues to go even though she
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	She's been shot in the head
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Had there's a parked car behind this tree
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And you actually see this
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Parked car move
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	When she runs
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then these guys
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Takeoff
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It was
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Not fun
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To watch it was
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	What happens next
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Maybe
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Really start to understand what this
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Technologies
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Real quickly
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Show you some of the
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Ross walks in he takes that moment
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Horrible moment and then he starts to like shoot back and forth in time
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Before the murder hears his path after the murders
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:08,319	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The two cars from that murder and you see he draws on the map you see that they meet up with two other cars
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:14,719	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	See that guy there that were involved in a different now one murder becomes two two cars become four
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:20,095	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Stop and if you follow all four of these cars drawing lines as they move through the city
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	You find out who they meet up with him for becomes KAIT8 becomes so on and so on and you have all these
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	These lines crisscrossing the city and then you see that a whole bunch of those cars
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Are headed to one play
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This house
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This house appears to be there cartel headquarters
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That's when you start to think
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Well that's how you have to take something like
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This town
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's not
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,791	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	A One-Shot thing like solving the crime
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's about
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Cracking an entire system
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	In fact
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This is Andy here at the when I was
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Doing some research
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Into this
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I'd be able to calls and I spoke with this one government
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Who told me that this information that rosset
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Showed us
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It was one of the primary tools
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Used to dismantle
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	An entire cartel
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,416	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	War is in that
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Apparently
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The leader of that cartel
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Was responsible
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Something like

EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Cigarettes again so how are you feeling at the
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This point are you
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Happier
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Scared
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Feel ashamed of myself
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Because I thought
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	All the reason why I'm so excited about it is it
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Because it's in a country
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Where I don't live
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And I'm an outsider and I think of it as being messed up
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So it's okay for them
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But it's still not okay for us
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	What did you think any
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I mean
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Like this is where I
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Stop being a good journalist
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Because I picked
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Decide
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It feels wrong
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Tinashe
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:02,752	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Solve these crimes
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That we can solve
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And what if his plane is on top of New York
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Good
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	God really
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	From me it became
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Look at you remember like after 9/11 when you'd walk down the street and you cure the F6
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	16 circling over the city
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I just remember the feeling in my stomach was like nausea like I felt sick
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It felt
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Gross
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,560	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It felt like we had no
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Autonomy over ourselves in at that point I was scared enough that I could live with it but right now I don't feel that way
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Look at it's a very privileged position
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To be able to say that we shouldn't have
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I get that
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I've became a convert
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Because
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Somebody got kidnapped today
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And if we had an eye in the sky we might be able to get the kids back in a few
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,600	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Minutes hours
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:54,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Compared to like you see the stats on Amber Alerts they're not good
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	What we're talking about is like and I'm not saying that I'm like anti McNutt at all but what I'm saying is like
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's very easy to paint it as we're going to get bad guys and I just don't think it's that Z
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	McNutt & Co
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They seem like decent people they have set limitations for themselves they have said they will not use photography that could get any closer
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Leave me the moral choice
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	How do we know other people will make the same world
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Joyce and
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Even though this thing might solve
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Ton of crime
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I save lives
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's still not worth the risk
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Because
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It just ask
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Level of
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Trust
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	In government
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That we shouldn't
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We shouldn't give
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Is that what you're saying
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	For now yes
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Back to dating what would happen in Dayton
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Well I was pretty impressed
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	After that five-day demo
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The police chief
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Richard Beale
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I recommended
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That we
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Enter into
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	A contract
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Is veiled sister
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They took it to the city Commission
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's minutiae New York
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	According to Carrie gray director of the city Commission office for the city of Dayton Ohio
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:14,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The city commission was interested in the in the presentation but they decided that before they go forward they should have a public
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So they can
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Hear from the
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	There was about 75 or so people there and he says that the people of Dayton
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	People of Radiolab
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Note to self
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:28,928	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I'm very divided a quarter of the people
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Work
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Supportive of this technology and they were frustrated with the amount of crime their belief was I'm not doing anything wrong
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So I don't care what the people see me doing
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:44,544	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We want this implemented and we want it implemented very broadly you know Bring It On they were basically
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Then there was another group
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Slightly smaller but not my mind maybe 15% that was the Robert benucch Camp believe
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This was
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Is a grotesque
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Invasion of privacy and some of the people spoke in
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Very impassioned
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Terms
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Yay
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I think they calling it grotesque invasion of privacy would pretty much reflect the weight and the way this group was feeling
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And that there was no way that you could trust government
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	With is volume of information and this breath of information
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So you had your Pros in your car
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The rest of the people like the majority maybe had some feelings one way or another but just didn't have enough information and
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And so they came and kind of
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Eye mask Quest
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Like how long will persistent surveillance systems keep the images
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	90 days
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	How far can they zoom in can they see my face
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Know something it'll ask questions
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Which carry seems to think that they could have answered they could have gotten everybody on board
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But in the end
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Even though the room was basically divided into
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Three parts
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The naysayers we're so loud
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:53,408	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And so impassioned
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That these would have defined the combo
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	As we do
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So we took that lesson to understand that
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They was going to
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To be
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Some significant
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Education that was going to be needed and some significant hurdles that we're going to have to be crossed
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:12,096	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Before that we were able to do a broad-based implementation
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Based on the amount of time it was going to have to be spent
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:22,336	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We decided there were other more immediate techniques that could be used it could be invested in
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And we took the money that could have been spent on this
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And spend it on some other activities
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It seems like what you're saying is it like
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:32,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It was just going to be too hard to get people of the heart also like a snot worth
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I think that's probably probably accurate So the plan is off
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Table saw
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's off the table for right now
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But that doesn't mean that it's never coming back on
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I think it's fair to say
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Frustrating to him
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Right now we've got about a hundred fifty million dollars for the proposal sitting out there
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	For a large number of cities Baltimore Philadelphia to Moscow with their were waiting for them to make
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We've done Compton and Jerome
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:10,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Compton's like maybe or is it like maybe dating is like maybe a whole lot of babies out there
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	What McKnight and his team were doing now and this is actually what they were doing when we went to visit them
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They're analyzing as we are looking at a
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Turnpike or something yet traffic in New Jersey
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Understanding traffic
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We look at congested areas which are typically especially in that part of the country
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Exits and on-ramps any kind of Junction in a highway sometimes you just
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Ice cream
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:49,120	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Since we did that story things have happened manoush
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Did they have
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That's why I've invited you back
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Here to fill us in on further developments of which there have been gigantic one
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Very recently yes and McNutt says not just
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:02,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Since we heard that episode but because we are that
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,992	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Episode
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	After this episode first one out
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It turns out that there were a couple very wealthy philanthropist listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they pick up the phone
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They called him and he said
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	We would like to be the people that bankroll
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	You giving us a try in a in an American city somewhere
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So they he's biggest hits
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Will write you a check if you can land the city will give you the money
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Pretty much we decided who are these people they are Laura and John Arnold their young they're in their early forties they're
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Are in Texas
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And by the time that they contacted McNutt
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	He already done as
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:44,416	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	As we said he'd already done a very expensive look at
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Cities Across the Nation
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Looking for the one that had the biggest crime issue and is he puts it the strongest
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Political leadership somebody who would be
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Willing to put up with The Firestorm that would inevitably ensue Baltimore fit the bill it had a
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Mayor who said she was very tough on crime
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Shootings were actually up in Baltimore by 72% last year
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,224	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So he went
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,016	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Back to Baltimore instead
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	If I can get the money for this are you game
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they were like
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Sure
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:20,000	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So the rich folks were willing to give money to the mayor of Baltimore
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To put a plane in the sky to take pictures of Voldemort for a discrete. No not quite
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:28,960	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So it didn't go to the government or any elected officials
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,288	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Nobody needed to sign off on this in the city of Baltimore
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Other than the police commissioner which is why he was able to do it
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Without telling any of the city council members or
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The mayor War II Baltimore Police Department without telling the mayor of the city council Rio
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Besides the contract with this
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Fellow supported by two people in Texas to put a plane in the sky to gaze down in Baltimore in every
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Everyone in Baltimore I mean just don't mention this
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	To the mayor
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:01,472	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Did McNutt move to Baltimore and do this
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	He moved to Baltimore
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they set up across the street
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:10,432	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	From the police station and had about a dozen analyst sitting there
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:14,528	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	For two months looking at everything that was going on in Baltimore
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They did see some stuff during the street like a give me an a example of
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Something
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Bad that happened this day
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Everyone that we know about
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Which is that there was an elderly brother and sister the woman is 90 years old
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The brothers 82 and they work right there near this bus stop and they actually got in the line of fire they got gun
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Down by a shooter
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And so they end up tracking a couple cars
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	But then later they think the police say actually we think he got away on foot
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:45,504	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I think it was a witness
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	On the ground who said that they thought that he had left on foot
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And so
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Rewind and they see a. Scrambling to get away from the scene
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It goes
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:01,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Down the street it passes a Subway sandwich shop it goes between these two houses
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I'm stopped at a car that's parked
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And then it ends up at
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They later discovered the home of a woman and turns out
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:14,432	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Her boyfriend is somebody who has a long criminal record
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:19,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And so there are over 700 CCTV cameras on the streets
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	In Baltimore and to the idea is that it's sort of a support mechanism right like they get the high-level then it goes to the store
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Street then you got the officers on the ground and then shooter shoots man gets into a car and goes down Elm Street
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	You have cameras down on Elm Street
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And you can see maybe the car and then the driver's license and maybe even capture the face
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,872	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And did they eventually arrest
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This person so he cries
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	State lines and the FEDS pick them up
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,040	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Okay so they made the arrest
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They going to court and they say to the judge okay we obtain information about the suspect in
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Heart to Aspire plane does the stuff that they gathered during this
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:01,792	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Few months
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Is that now going before judges in becoming evidence and arrests and prosecution
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Well not yet we talk to the State's Attorney's office they got a briefing about a month ago from the police about what McNutt had
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Been up to
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they also told us that there are five open and pending cases
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Where this surveillance technology
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	With you
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The police are using it
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	They say this is the State's Attorney's office that they're looking forward to learning more about what
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,976	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	McNutt actually does
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And they are trying to determine whether in fact
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	All those pictures
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:42,752	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Could be used in some way at trial but they're not ready to say yes this absolutely will pass illegal
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:45,568	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Muster in a trial
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The other objection I guess I was thinking about was that the defense
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The people as a matter of Justice as a matter of the Fourth Amendment
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So you know this is going to come up with something
EDL	00:32:55,296	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Yeah then
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The defense lawyers would say wait a second
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:00,672	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	This
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Evidence against my client was obtained without not only his or her
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Permission but without anybody
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Permission and the entire town
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Is now
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	In a
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:13,472	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	React searchable
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:14,752	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	During
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:16,032	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Just on sunny days
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	And did the founding fathers want that to happen he hasn't seen a ton of these
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Master violence cases but actually Robert I mean
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	I happen to have the Fourth Amendment here and I want to read it to you
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:34,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	It's got you says you can't the searches and seizures are prohibited the right of the people to be secure in their persons house
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:40,608	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:42,400	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Issue but upon probable cause
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:49,056	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seen
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	So by that token inside
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,152	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	People to be searched
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Everyone in Baltimore
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:56,736	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Places to be looked at
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Every place in Baltimore
EDL	00:33:58,784	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Oath to be
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Obtained
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,112	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Ahead of time
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Blanket
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That's a pretty radical thing
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:09,024	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Yeah and when you put it like that no wonder there's
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Very likely to be
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Inevitable
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Big legal
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Public debate over whether this is the answer to Baltimore's crime problem
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	McNutt says
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	He thinks very very soon
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	The police are going to release
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	An evaluation report

EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:30,528	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	He thinks
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,856	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	Whatever Baltimore decides
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	That's going to set a precedent
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:39,744	| radiolab_podcast16eyeinskyupdate |	For mid-sized cities that are struggling across the United States
