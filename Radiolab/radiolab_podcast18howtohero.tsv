EDL	00:00:25,344	00:00:26,368	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Selflessness
EDL	00:00:26,368	00:00:27,136	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Show me the map
EDL	00:00:28,160	00:00:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Okay so you ready for this it's a while back we we did the story that
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:36,096	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Brussels is really stuck in our heads
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It was a story that was
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Ask and it's really deep question and the answer that we got to answer didn't quite
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:43,264	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Click
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yeah it's so just assertive
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:49,408	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Set the table the question was why do people
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do good in the world
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:56,320	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	World so we ask that question look at it from the perspective of genetics computer science all kinds of things we ended up profile
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:56,832	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	3
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Jordan Air
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:01:00,416	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Heroically good
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,952	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	People that were Heroes
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Slate that remarkable things
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We told her stories with that question in mind why do certain people do good in the world and others don't
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yeah so we can revisit that question today in the story that we told
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:15,520	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Because I think we have something better and smarter to say about it finally something
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Very peculiar to say about us it turns out.
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	First and then going to come back and hopefully sheds new light on
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:24,992	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Here we go
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,600	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Again this story just began with a simple question
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That question lettuce
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Two guy named Walter Rutkowski executive director and Secretary of the Carnegie hero fund Commission
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Cool thanks for doing this
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Can you just give us a little background on
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The hero fund what is the Carnegie hero fund
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The Carnegie hero fund is
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is a private operating Foundation
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:52,128	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It was established by Andrew Carnegie in 1904
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:56,992	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And what we do is recognize civilian heroism throughout the United States
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Canada
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	By giving an award called The Carnegie medal
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And accompanying the Carnegie medal is a financial Grant
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How much
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:07,232	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Currently the amount is $5,000
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And how do you guys choose Your Heroes
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We judge the
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Heroic acts against a list of
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Performance
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So then you have to have some kind of definition of hero which includes some and excludes other yes
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Perfect basic definition
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Which is
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,152	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Civilian
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Meaning no military
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Who voluntarily to
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Leave the point of safety degree
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Risk his own life
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Apply for
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,392	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To an extraordinary degree
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To save or to attempt
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,440	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To save
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The life of another human
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	6
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How about 7
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Just came from memory so don't like it happens in a person's mind at that pivotal moment when they decide to voluntarily
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Voluntarily leave a safety and risk their life to extraordinary degree
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To save a life
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Another human that's what I wanted to know
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Treatise jumping
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,760	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Okay so the first one we have on our list is
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is a loris
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Shrek okay
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Phone number 73546
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And the award number is 8
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	8000 +
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I am Laura shrake
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,000	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I am from
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Mattoon Illinois and I
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Currently live in
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Dubai United Arab
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Laura spoke with our producer timeout okay so we're going back a little bit
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yeah 15 years
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Back in the mid-90s
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	21 year old College to
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And I was driving through the country
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And attack
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Faster
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	She stopped to see what was going on and started yelling at her
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To see what I could do
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The woman was on the ground in the pool was
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Turn the air back on the ground while he was clearly struggling
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Side of the fence but
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Defense
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Was Electric
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So here's the moment that we find fascinating
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	At this point Laura can either go forward through thousands of volts of electricity toward an angry bull that will lie
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Likely Mall her to or
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	She can stay safe
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I went ahead and
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Just climb through the fence
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And I don't remember ever feeling the electricity
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	She says by the time she got through
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	A neighbor has shown up in through or piece of pipe
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The whole time she's yelling at me
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Hit the ball in the face as hard as
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	As you can and don't stop
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Shrek went up to the bull
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Beat It repeatedly
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Which is 2 foot lengths of tubing
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I think
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It distracted the bull enough
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Where she was able to get out from under him
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And as soon as we are outside the fence
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Looking back into the past
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The bull was literally right there
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Apus
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Get the ground few times and snorted
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He was not happy
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To a question
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When you were there at that fence
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You had
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The choice either stay put or to go through it
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What was going through your mind when it was there calculation there
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	No
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Can't really say that
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I mean you know your options or anything like that I did not know
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It was just
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Here's the problem
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Here's what I need to do
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Something needed to
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So there's no choice moment
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Not that I recall
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	No
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	If nobody came to This Woman's rescue she would die
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This is the usual explanation
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I couldn't stand there and not
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do any
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,047	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I would like
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,583	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Repeal 2A
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I didn't really take the time
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think about
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What else could
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I can't say I ever really thought about loan
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Okay we just jumped ahead cuz we thought we try again that's the voice of the next Carnegie hero that

EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How do they do that
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So it's
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The point which
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You said You Heard a Voice
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Said I can do that
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I can do this
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What's what is amazing to me
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is it you left your daughter's right here and dive after a guy you don't know
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He was a stranger total stranger but you know what
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The mission wasn't come completed
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I was chosen for that
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You felt shows like you were charged
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I feel like I'm the chosen one
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Luther religious person though
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I would plunder
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Why me
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Maybe 20 years ago
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I was supposed to be
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	At a certain point
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And then explain to us exactly why he jumped he was the one guy who could
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He said right before his feet left the platform this one specific moment
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	From his life flash to mine
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This thing to happen
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I had a gun full to my temple but you know that it was a misfire so
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	A gun was put to your head and miss it so you are almost dead for almost dead
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So you think you might have been spared for
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	After that moment he says when the gun went click
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He didn't die
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,935	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He always wondered
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Why had God spared him
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That moment
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Until he was on the platform
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Guy fall off
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He says when he knew
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This is why I can do this you just I could do this I can do this
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That boys when a boy said that you going to be okay I knew everything was going to work out
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You know what I think
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The end of the day
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I don't think that there's an answer to the question we asked
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I don't think you're a question
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Why were you a hero I don't think that any three of these here I mean the last one had the longest explanation
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He had been selected for some purpose but does he know why you lying I'm not a clue.
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	9/3 gives me some
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What is he give you
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Okay so the first to write they have no idea
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,439	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This is just something in them that made them at
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Pick a number 3
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Talking about circumstances
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The world prepared him for that mower
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Serendipity
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Makes me think
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What what if
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Circumstances are just right
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Tamela Mann
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He used to say to me all the time usage
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How did you make
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I don't know if I could have done that
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	As well you know what
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Don't say you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do that
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do your put in that situation
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Back when we asked Walter
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How many nominations
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do you get a year
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Are they hard to find
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	No they are not hard at all
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Defined
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We are fortunate to be living in a society
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Regardless of what you hear elsewhere
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We are fortunate
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Society where people do Lookout
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Others even strangers
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He told us
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	They've even have to up their guidelines
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Make it harder to win
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Simply because of the vast number for wrote Deeds
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Happening day-to-day life
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I got to save it
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We went with this feel good thought about
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	About all the people who are doing good because I honestly don't think we knew what to say
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Say to end that story was nice to know there was a lot more good people than we thought
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We went to we were trying to figure out why people
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Why do people who do that do that and why we're different are there different than us at the end we didn't really get there
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But then yeah
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This guy walked
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You should say
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:32,575	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I just for a business purposes who you are once again Robert sapolsky I'm a professor of neuroscience at
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Stanford University Robert has been on our program many many times talking about any number of things that you just come out
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Out with a book called behave trying to explain why we do everything we do
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Rain in the history of the culture everything
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Maybe he would have something to say about it
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Puzzle
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yep I will it let me just let just ask you you've heard all three of these things
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What does this what do these details make you think
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think what we see
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	With all three
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is how highfalutin moral reasoning plays like zero role in what went on their moral reasoning
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Doesn't do anything
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Can You Stand The First
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think about it supposed to be told us which
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is it
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When we were asking people what were they thinking
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Serve the wrong question
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And everybody else always gets the same answer we just
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I wasn't thinking I was
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Feeling about what if this were my sixteen-year-old daughter I hearing a voice or
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	With the bull woman sang I wasn't thinking
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Like before I knew it I had jumped in
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The evidence suggests
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Sapolsky says that in situations like this
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	People just don't reason their way to a decision that's not how it works correct people don't think their way
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Turn moral decision in fact you give people enough time to release
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think their way in a circumstance like that
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Most people think their way to concluding this isn't my problem or
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Somebody else will take care of it work
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Here's why it's their fault
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So that means I'm okay if it's not thinking or moral reason
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Then maybe what these heroes are doing is they're their feeling
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	There there
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	They're empathizing more than the rest
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That's why they do what they do
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,927	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Ironically probably not
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Probably not yeah
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Okay Sue empathy your ear feeling somebody else's pain
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Weather
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Paying your toes on fire or pain
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Feeling the pain of somebody else
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Pain is painful
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And if it's painful enough and acute and burning enough what that translates into
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I can't take it this
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Too upsetting and you need to run away
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Some point
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	If you were mostly focused
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	On my God what were this to be with this feel like if this were happening to me
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That's the predictor of people who don't necessarily don't very readily make that leap
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	From feeling empathy
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To actually acting compassionately
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	No that's not what I asked you to say I thought you were going to take it the other way
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Hot when it's memememememe at your pain is my pain
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Those people are less likely to step forward
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	They're less likely to actually go into the compassionate thing
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Suppose he told us that there have actually been studies that have found this
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That win
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Someone
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,512	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Actually empathizes
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Physically feels another person
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Pain
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	They're more likely to turn away from it
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Rather than
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:32,032	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Step forward and try and alleviate that person suffering you put somebody in a circumstance and for example how many shocks
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Really willing to get to intervene
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To help somebody in some simulation
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Game for example
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:43,296	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And you look at is this the person whose heart rate soars
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,624	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When they see somebody else in this tough situation
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Or is this the kind word remains fairly steady
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The latter is more likely to act compassionately
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So interest okay so what we're barreling towards here is
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It's not so much about moral reasoning
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It's not so much about new Fast empathy but it's about a type of empathy
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That allows you to remain detached enough
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I actually Act
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So emotional distance will create the Humane or Charlack
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,344	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Exactly
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You need a certain amount of detached
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That's surprisingly where comes in
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:28,864	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And that runs counter to so many of our instincts about what empathy should be about and what I think we see
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	See here is probably the most reliable Realm
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	People going into English heroic thing
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Which is when it's implicit
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When it's automatic
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When it's not you sitting there reasoning through well how many coffees my jeans am I going to pass on if I do this for my
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	My close relatives
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And where's not empathy
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The hour
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Feeling for this person or as this person or with this person or above the
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And instead
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Before I knew it
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I jumped in the river to save this child
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And I think that's where you see some of the most
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Interesting reliably
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	24 Robux stuff
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	When it's implicit when it's
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:10,080	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And you know how a person can
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Get that
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Kind of
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Compassion made implicit is it
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It is something you're born with or something cultural at your parents
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Can you have any idea
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The thing is
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We don't know what
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Hunt about the neurobiology of how
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	A moral good goes from being a frontal task
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To an implicit task
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But we know what time about how that works in a much more mundane area
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Which is like
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You'll learn how to do something
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Like you're a Pianist and you're learning some new top piece of music
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	This is really tough
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Trill
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And every time you're playing it
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:56,928	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	As you approach the trill your thinking here it comes remember tuck your elbow and weed with your thumb
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Come and do this
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It is what would be called a declarative task
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Claire's
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Explicit knowledge
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And that's completely about this part of brain the hippocampus talkin the frontal cortex
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And it's sitting there saying here it comes and remember how you do it and remember how you do it wrong what happened last time and
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How great it felt when you talked to your elbow into remember to that and then
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Suddenly there's the day
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,272	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	We are playing the peace
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And you realized your four measures passed the trill and you played it just fine
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,720	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That's the first day you played it without having to think about it
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And jargon in the learning field is it is stopped
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Being
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	An explicit
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Declarative task
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,424	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And it's become an implicit
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Procedural tasks
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	That's the first
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Time
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,312	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Your hands know what better than your heads
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Take somebody who's like beating the pants off of you at tennis
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And they've just unlike some amazing backhand and crushed you
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And what you need to do strategically now is
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Force them to take that procedural knowledge and make it to Claret again
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Stop at that point you give him this
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Sequias
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Smile
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Cuz you're amazing
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Tennis player that was amazing
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	How did you do that
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do you put your hand over on that side of the West Side what what about your butt
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Scrunching your butt on the left side of the right
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Any for some it's like you make somebody like
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think very
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Explicitly and procedurally how you go down flights of stairs and you're going to fall down the stairs because none of us have done stairs procedurally
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Since we are about 2 and 1/2 years old
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:35,488	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Swarmed over our threesome release the first two of our threesome they might have been ruined for the next experience
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But if you let them do their natural thing
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Then they would rescue again maybe
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	If I could just keep it in place at
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do you think that the simplicity
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Do you think that that there's a clean dramatically analogy I mean do you think that
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is that it
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The people
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	For whom it is automatic
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It's automatic.
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Because they practice
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	In the way that like the primes Subway
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,880	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Yeah freak zample Lots
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Studies were done this to which people in
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Either Germany or nazi-occupied
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Europe
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Shielded Jews
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Give them shelter but their own lives at risk
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And it wasn't predicted by level of
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Vacation there goes all that moral reasoning stuff
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And it wasn't even protect
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Predicted by things like religiosity was
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	People who had simply been raised
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You do the right thing
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It was automatic
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	It was implicit for them
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	They didn't have to sit there
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Think about or feel about it was automatic
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Is that thank you mommy and daddy is that what that is
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Thank you mommy daddy Rabbi priest
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What is that
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,352	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I think it's mostly that
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But of course it's messier than playing a Trill on a piano we're doing a 10 that I can
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Meet people first learned about it and
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:55,872	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You literally can see the transition from which part of the brain's handling the task
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	To the initial view was okay that's how you do trill's on the piano
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But then you see something even more amazed
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Which has more complex stuff happens my my father
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:09,440	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	In his last years had
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Pretty severe dementia
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He was as a professor or even an architectural historian and he reached a point where
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:23,008	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	He could not identify the names of all of this kids consistently didn't know where he was what decade excetera
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	But
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Crompton
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And he could give you the
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Totally Lucid opinionated
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Frankie entertaining
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	10 minute lecture on the history of flying buttress
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Then come back two minutes later and prompt them again and you give you the exact same one again
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,184	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	For him that was as implicit
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	As
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	The tennis player doing the backhand
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Or playing the trolls on the piano when
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:51,424	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I fully expect when I'm demented someday I'll give this exact
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	What sure that I just gave and I can do it over and over and over and students complain
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	So all sorts of stuff more complex than a tennis backhand becomes implicit
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	I think what we're seeing with the woman with the boulder in the elect
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Expense is
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Something
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Ratably
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	High-level abstract stuff
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Becomes implicit as well
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You don't like fling your elbow way out to the right when you do the trill
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:21,120	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	And you don't stand by and watch somebody being like done in
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	You just before you know it you don't reason you don't feel you just do it before I knew it I had to run in there
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	No is this one of your lectures do you talk about that this very thing love
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Otherwise when we come and visit you in 13 years will you be treating us with this very
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Precisely
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Empathy empathy is an interesting topic sit down this will be on the final
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast18howtohero |	Big big thanks to Robert sapolsky who's new book
