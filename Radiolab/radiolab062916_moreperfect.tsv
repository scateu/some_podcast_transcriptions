EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:09,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	There's often disconnect like laws are these things that float above us all these beautiful abstractions
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:13,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And yet if you want to challenge law you've got to find a person
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Down here in the mud
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:20,575	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Who's experienced perfectly SoMo captures what you feel is wrong with the law you got to find a perfect plaintiff
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:25,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	How do you find that person what happens if they're not so perfect
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:31,071	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	These two stories are going to hear about a particular tactic that sometimes called test case litigation
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And I wasn't aware of the for catheter
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The Second Story actually touches on a current case
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,007	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Just decided a few days ago
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,311	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Affirmative action will meet the guy
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Who brought that case
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:47,967	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The critics say it's basically destroying some of the most iconic civil rights law from the 60s
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	First
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:54,367	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Get back to Katherine Wells with a story of a case called Lawrence V Texas
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Okay
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,415	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Come on Inn
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I brought out my alarm
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,023	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Vs Texas box of
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Stop
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:07,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So went to Houston and I visited a guy named Mitchell katine he's a lawyer there
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,519	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He showed me the arrest papers he had the arrest paper
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,543	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Words for these two guys
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	CJ Lawrence Criminal
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Officers observed
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The defendant engaged
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In deviant sexual
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,455	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Conduct
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,759	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Charged with homosexual conduct
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's right there in writing
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:31,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It really is strange to see those words on a piece of paper it seems like such an anachronism but it was not actually
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,255	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Has dated
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	September 17th 1998
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Now in 1998
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,959	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Texas wasn't the only state that had this kind of law on the books
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:47,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	At least 13 other states also had an anti-sodomy law and it's important to note that you know this law wasn't used very
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:54,271	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Very much people were not arrested for this law because when would police be present in your home to observe you having

EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	International law
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,879	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	SMU Law School
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,207	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I mean sodomy laws weren't really about stopping any
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Body from having sex
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They were really about ensuring
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That we could label
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People Criminal
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It was
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,423	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A label that
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,447	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People could point to
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,799	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So the people who disapproved of homosexuality could say
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Looks defining a
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Of homosexuality
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A crime
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Crime
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Can you commit the crime
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,831	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Well you're a criminal it's a criminal statute people can say your criminal
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Which then give the state
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:36,255	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Illegal basis to justify all sorts of housing discrimination employment discrimination
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Military and every context
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,559	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Statin effect
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	How many people argue that these laws
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They also sent
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,519	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A strong cultural message
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:55,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Killing in this was at a time when hate crimes in Houston word
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:01,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Surprisingly comments after being beat with a nail-studded two-by-four
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:07,999	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	2nd senseless killing in the Montrose area in less than three months is a lot of blood and was really apparent that he
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Benshot
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:15,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To make a long story short was very eager to repeal that sodomy law
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Okay so John and Tyrone were arrested on a Thursday night
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,799	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The next day it's so happen
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because of the location of John Lawrence's apartment
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The case landed in a Justice of the
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:30,271	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Peace Court meaning after Quinn made the arrest
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,575	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The report was sent to that court for processing
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Now this court is
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Mostly deals with traffic
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's mostly a traffic court
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:40,511	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But there happens to be this clerk in the court
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Who was
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:47,935	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Gay and it couldn't believe that there that somebody had actually been arrested for homosexual conduct in their home
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:52,543	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is Clerk and his partner go to a bar start talking to the bartender

EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:14,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You just can't believe that such a thing happened it's such an unusual occurrence
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And

EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And that's when it hit me
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Oh
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,295	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I mean it was so clear night and day to me

EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,751	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He been waiting for this moment how long have you been looking for a case
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	7/8 years
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	7 light years
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Cuz just too
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Laid out explicitly what why did you need I need a test case
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,759	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You can't change a law like that
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If you don't have
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,319	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A case
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:12,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People in the Texas legislature have been trying to remove this law from the book
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:18,303	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Books for years according to Jill Carpenter every time someone would introduce a proposal to repeal the law it would
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,423	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It just wasn't really going anywhere
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So activist who decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the legislature and go straight to the courts
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,895	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So I need a case I had to have a someone guilty

EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Conversation basically went like this

EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:08,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Basically neither of them had any interest like no interest
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And being a public figure
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You're so
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,503	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I gave him the whole
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:19,903	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What your country can do for you ask not what you can do for your country speech I mean literally
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:26,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I reminded them of who Harry hay was
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,655	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Arguably the founder of the original LGBT movement
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Ulysses may not remember but at one time it was illegal for
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,543	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Certain number of gay male
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,335	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And the LGBT community
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,895	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To get together in one location is illegal
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:44,223	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Can do it the idea that they would be Networks
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:50,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'm sanctuaries in places where we can come an hour to which we would be able to move and organize and change things across the
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The country
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So I told him a little bit about that history in
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,511	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	How far we've come and how far we had to go
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,047	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And that
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,071	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Badinage
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	How to change that
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So I told him
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I said
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,263	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'll be able to protect you
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	For maybe the first year or two
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But there's going to come a time when
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It will no longer be about you
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,479	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It'll be about some
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Much much bigger
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,295	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They agreed
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,671	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Tyrone's attitude was okay
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,231	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What do you need me to do
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,559	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	John was much more indignant
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,119	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They took the wrong person
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:34,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Golden song
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It was a ridiculous law
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,007	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Texas loves to keep Samantha
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Quiet things around
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He was mad
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He was angry
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Here's where the story gets
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Complicated
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,735	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:51,039	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	At one point according to Lane Lewis
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:56,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They were having this conversation and John was ranting you know about how he been treated and
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He said you know what the worst part is we won't even
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,303	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He said
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,351	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That they were not having sex
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Wait what but they were not having sex they were
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Sitting in their underwear on the couch
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,263	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Watching the late-night news
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:17,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They say they were sitting there doing nothing and the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But they were never even having sex
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,503	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Wave it is in this whole case about them having sex
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So you're saying the thing that this case is supposed to be about
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Might not be true
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Right so I interviewed
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,439	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Three of the four police off
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:33,279	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Carpenter says when he talked to the police officers
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,583	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He did find that their stories were sort of all over the
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:38,143	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The place one guy said it was anal sex seesaw
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	One day later said he thought it might have been oral
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Officer said they never saw anything
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:46,847	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fidel says he believes John story there probably was actually no sex
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:53,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You think what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gaytard on the wall and some gay magazines lying around
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,783	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Feeling that really set off the office
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:17:01,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they said well we know they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point and that's illegal in Texas
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:05,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	No no I'm not there was no no no doubt about it I mean I have no
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	No reason to live Quinn to this day
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,423	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Still insist that he walked in on them
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:17,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Copulating he says he saw what he saw and he just did his job
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:21,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That's fine I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	My opinion that's what it is
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,783	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In a way it doesn't matter
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:33,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because when John said that Tulane that they weren't even having sex
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,719	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Message on don't ever say that again
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Don't ever say that to anybody
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,607	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Again
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because we could have people know that
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,959	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We couldn't have people find that out
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,519	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is it going to go forward to this yet we were scared that
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,591	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Another case would get screwed up at that point
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And potentially
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:59,039	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The da dropping the charges if police report
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,575	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You had to preserve the LIE
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Correct correct
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Dumb question
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,951	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is that that's okay it wasn't our job
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,071	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	2
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Prove or disprove the LIE
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:18,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that night the thing that mattered
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,031	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Arrest report
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:22,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Set but if what the arrest report said
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Potentially didn't happen
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Should that matter
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Well
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	No no one
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:31,039	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth this is a misc
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Conception does not bring out the
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:36,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hotel Carpenter against people who play their roles
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,927	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And pursuing
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,231	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Whatever they think their best interests are
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,023	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That's exactly what happened
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,959	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	For the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the news
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,007	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And why was that
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,543	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Well they had a tendency to drink
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And get Rowdy and fight
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:59,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they like to go to CD hotels and rent rooms and get really really
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:01,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hi drunk whatever
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,551	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And inevitably they would start fighting with each other
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And so
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What I did what I would do without wood
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:09,695	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I knew the difference
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:15,583	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Places they've stayed since he would go to the city hotels and talk to the clerk's give him a business card tell him
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If these boys come and check in they cause problems
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Call me first
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:24,031	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fan on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2 in the morning
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:30,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm going to have to call the cops I would jump out of bed put on my clothes cuz we couldn't have them
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:35,807	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You know what they're already on the front page of the Houston Chronicle we could not have our dependence
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,951	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So I would drive down there and I would figure out
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,999	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Which one was causing the most problems
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Put them in my car
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:48,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And I would drive them somewhere else I would separate them out
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That happened more than once
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:51,935	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	More than once
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Celine city of the spear that
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,591	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	John and Tyrone wood would start talking to the media and let something slip
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,103	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	About
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Their version of the story
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:06,271	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So we gave them these little cards kept small little sentence basically said

EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:21,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Right that's what you get screwed up when you start thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of your wallet
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:21,887	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Read it
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Even though there were these close calls
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,287	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	As a case wound its way through the court system
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Mitchell katine told me about this
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,359	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	One time there was this
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Press conference
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And we came outside to the normal media
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Group that was out there wanting
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:41,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Quotes and talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers that wanted to hear from the clients

EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:35,168	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Uppercase who care has further questions

EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:59,232	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The question before the court
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,048	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Have a Texas statute
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,608	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	For two persons of the same sex
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:06,400	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Intimate sexual
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,960	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Everybody's waiting for the out
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,240	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Houston
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:10,752	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Texas
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:17,664	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Super context it wasn't totally clear how this case was going to come out because 17 years earlier there'd been a case called
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,760	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Bowers vs Hardwick
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:22,528	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:25,344	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Then they ruled that sodomy laws were fine
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:28,928	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	There is no constitutional
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,440	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Conclusion
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:32,512	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But there should be a fundamental right to engage
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,304	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Homosexual sodomy
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,376	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And Supreme Court almost never will sings order that recent
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:44,800	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So Justice Kennedy starts talking about all the similarities between the cases
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,592	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Dispatched
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:50,432	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The tension starts building
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:55,040	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And then finally he got
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,576	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To the moment where he said
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,952	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And it's not correct today
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:09,376	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People sobbing
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:16,032	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Stars versus Hardwick should be
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:26,528	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Rallies Across the Nation gay rights Advocates celebrated their legal Victory a ruling so brought it surprised even many of
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:32,672	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Court rules in favor of two Texas man who challenged a state law that made homosexual
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:38,048	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The ruling overturned a Texas law that allowed police to arrest gays for having sex
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,840	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	12 other states have similar laws
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:44,704	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Including a good morning John Lawrence was at home in his apartment in Houston
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:48,544	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Watching the tanks
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:51,616	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And all of a sudden it says has rule the law in concert
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,720	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I came out of bed quite happy
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,608	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Obviously not everybody
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:16,960	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What's happy about it clear that I have nothing against homosexuals
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:21,056	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Promoting their agenda
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,616	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Justice Scalia said
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,640	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Basically
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:30,016	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If you want this to happen that's fine but you're going about it the wrong way the court is not the place where this decision
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,088	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Should be made you need to go talk to your fellow citizens
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And convince them that this

EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,976	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Coming to us and asking us to bypass
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:42,560	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What your fellow citizens seem to want that is
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,328	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's not how
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:46,400	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Persuading one's fellow citizens
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:50,240	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And imposing one's views in absence of democratic
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,544	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is something else
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,592	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He sees this as a
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,664	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Small minority imposing their views
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,688	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	On everybody else

EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Today's opinion
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,088	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Dismantle
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,904	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The structure of constitutional law
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,976	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That has permitted a distinction to be made

EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'm homosexual
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:17,376	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Set this decision would open the floodgates
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,192	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And that it would only be a matter of time
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,728	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Before the court was being asked
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,520	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To decide on gay marriage
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:31,712	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And he was right when Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015

EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:36,064	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Private intimacy of same-sex couples

EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:17,472	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Of this term
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:21,568	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	University of Texas centers round the following question
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,128	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Use racial preferences in college admissions
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,432	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Now the University of Texas has a policy where the

EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:47,168	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But yes it is okay the Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,984	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fraction and higher education is constitutional
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:56,896	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher

EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Obvious liberal
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,560	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And he says slowly
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:05,120	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Overtime very
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,400	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Graduate
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,424	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He became one of those people
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:14,592	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston Garden variety
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,384	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Existence and
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:19,200	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Something happens that sends him on this entirely new
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What path
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:22,528	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:25,344	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The move from the suburbs into the downtown area
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,904	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Urban and in 1990
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,184	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	When
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:33,024	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We went to vote for the first time in our new neighborhood
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:36,608	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I realized that the Republican
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:38,656	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Party had not fielded
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:39,168	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Candidate
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:40,960	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To oppose the
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Democrat
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:42,496	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Incumbent
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:44,544	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Running for congress this is a
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,312	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	District that has
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:48,128	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Almost 600 thousand people
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:54,016	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You don't have a choice you only got one person running
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,320	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Decided to run himself
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:57,088	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I lost item
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:40:59,648	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It was no great surprise to anyone
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:00,928	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He actually lost by 32 point
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,976	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But along the way
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,024	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's something really unusual happened
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:12,704	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	During my campaign he and his wife Lark piano they decided they were going to go meet voters in their District
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:18,336	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I got a giant print out of all of the addresses in the 18th congressional district
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:23,712	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Call daywalking list and they just started going door-to-door meeting people handing out literature
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:26,528	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And I'd walk down say Oak Street
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,296	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Take
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:32,928	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The even side of Oak Street and my wife would take the odd
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Numbered side of
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Oak Street
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:38,304	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And we would start to walk and
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,888	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Very quickly they realized that
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,168	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The district
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:43,680	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Shape
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:44,960	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Was funny
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:51,360	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side wouldn't and sometimes the district would
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,919	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	McDonough Highway caption apartment,
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:55,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Flex come back at it just
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Didn't make sense
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:03,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom was peculiar because we had Maps
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:04,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We had to follow
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:05,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And it was
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:07,743	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Very odd the way some streets were
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:09,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And the districts and some weren't
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:13,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this could happen
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,679	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	After I guess a better week of this
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:21,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We realized that neighbors had been separated
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:26,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Almost house my house because of their race
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:32,063	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You come to believe that the reason this was done
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:35,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Was for the explicit purpose to create a majority at
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:35,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	African American
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,255	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	This is an untrue
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:48,447	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of 1960
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:52,287	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Of Americans are denied
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:53,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The right
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	McCall of their color
EDL	00:42:55,871	00:42:57,407	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	This act was
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Giant
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,735	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Step forward in civil rights
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:06,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	One of the primary things that day it is eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests all these
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,927	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Strategies that have been used to keep minorities
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:16,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And then this other thing it did sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:20,191	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Encourage the creation of districts where the majority of Voters
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Where minorities
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:22,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And that's because
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:25,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You know one of the strategies that have been used previously to
EDL	00:43:26,847	00:43:31,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:32,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They called it cracking lately
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,039	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Split them apart into many different
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So that they were never
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:39,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In the majority
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:40,415	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Elect representatives
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:42,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Bat
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:46,303	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	18th congressional district
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,863	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Was one of these majority-minority districts
EDL	00:43:48,863	00:43:49,887	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The district
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,423	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Drawn by the text
EDL	00:43:52,959	00:43:54,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But you have a slight
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:55,775	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	African American majority
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:57,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I think about 51%
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:43:58,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	African Amer
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:00,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But this was the problem according to bloom
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The way they got to that
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:07,551	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	African American majority was bite creating this District that's zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhood
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I could not understand
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:11,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People live close together they
EDL	00:44:11,391	00:44:15,231	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Eccentric kids to the neighborhood schools they shopped in the neighborhood
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:17,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Shopping centers they were worried about
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,559	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Neighborhood issues
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:21,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Rick these neighborhoods apart
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,143	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	By race
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,423	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Seemed
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:24,959	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So wrong
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:29,311	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In his mind this law was actually
EDL	00:44:29,311	00:44:32,127	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetua
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:37,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I don't know what a
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:40,063	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The average person upon realizing this would have done
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:41,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I decided
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:42,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To file a lawsuit
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:47,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Decided to sue the state of tech
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,511	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Call the few
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:49,279	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Friends
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:50,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Who lived in the 18th District
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:57,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And a few other districts in Texas American American Hispanic and Asian kept looking and looking and looking and
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:45:03,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Until I found a lawyer that I could afford $7,000 a month filed a lawsuit challenging the
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:07,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Constitutionality Texas's redistricting plan
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:10,527	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Recent charged with yes the Voting Rights Act was good in its day
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:15,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:19,231	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Worked its way through the lower courts and
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,255	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:45:21,535	00:45:22,559	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And surprise
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,863	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In 1995
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:31,775	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Number 94805 George W bush vs Alvera of the Supreme Court
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Look it up
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:36,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Yeah we all did
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:38,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Court so there we all are
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,479	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Our opponents
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:43,807	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Step to the lectern and
EDL	00:45:43,807	00:45:47,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The constitutionality of three congressional districts they make
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:51,743	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Their arguments
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:55,839	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Texas basically said all we have to put people together by race
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:58,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The Texas legislature has the obligation
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:03,007	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To satisfy Federal requirements in the federal requirements
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:08,127	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this District
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:13,759	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So that they have a chance to elect a representative or advocate
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:16,319	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	His arguments
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,415	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That was just being made I said
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:21,695	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But look at the map
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,719	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The map is
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:24,255	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Bizarre
EDL	00:46:24,255	00:46:26,303	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And the only reason
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:27,839	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It could have gotten this way as
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,119	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because you're only thinking about race
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Only race
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:35,519	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,799	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You cannot use
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:43,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:49,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A very tense situation
EDL	00:47:03,679	00:47:08,031	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Let me explain
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:09,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So in the end
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:15,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:16,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hair-splitting
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:20,319	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But I think it's at this deeper question that
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:23,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In our society
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:26,463	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about anyway
EDL	00:47:26,463	00:47:32,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You don't look if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:38,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take the
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:44,895	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context then
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:49,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account that they have to
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,295	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So it's a difficult balance
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,831	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You can't look at race
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:53,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But you have to look
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:55,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And
EDL	00:47:55,647	00:47:58,207	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The Supreme Court says to Texas look
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:48:01,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on us
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:06,655	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if he's communities with next to each other
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:10,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You're just sorting them based on
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:12,031	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Race alone and that's not good enough
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:14,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You can't do that when the
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:15,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Opinion came down
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:18,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The Supreme Court ruled in our favor five
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,479	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That was
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:21,503	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Quite
EDL	00:48:22,271	00:48:22,783	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A day
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:25,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The day that we won that lawsuit
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:30,207	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I was
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:32,511	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hooked forever
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:38,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	After that Edward Bloom decided that this would be expected became
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:45,311	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Do you support to try to strike down every race-based policy he could legal team
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:51,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I was taking on the road I recruited plaintiffs in New York Virginia South Carolina to check
EDL	00:48:51,711	00:48:53,503	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Challenge congressional district
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:57,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Plans and we won in each of those States

EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:15,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Look laws change

EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:46,367	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Able to be so effective
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:48,159	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To do this work you need a car
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:50,463	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Computer a printer a cell phone
EDL	00:53:52,511	00:53:53,535	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Really about it
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:55,839	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Play who pays for the lawyer fees
EDL	00:53:55,839	00:54:00,447	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Who do you go to individuals that know of my work
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	There are
EDL	00:54:01,215	00:54:02,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Foundations
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:07,359	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Okay so he's a 501 c 3 like the n-double-acp and Lambda legal that funded
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:08,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Lawrence versus Texas
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:11,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And if you're a 501 c 3 public
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:14,271	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Charity as he has you don't have to reveal your donors to the
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:17,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We do know a couple of his donors though and they're
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:19,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Wealthy very conservative
EDL	00:54:20,671	00:54:22,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So in the end what he does is
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:23,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Just sort of a
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:24,767	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	More
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:29,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Maybe more strategic or sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:31,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:32,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In this case that he just lost
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:33,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Last week
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:35,519	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	We wanted to challenge affirmative action
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:36,287	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:38,847	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The first thing you did was sort of do a cast
EDL	00:54:38,847	00:54:40,895	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He said to find the perfect
EDL	00:54:40,895	00:54:41,663	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	White suit
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:48,063	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Set up a website called UT not fair. Org
EDL	00:54:48,063	00:54:53,439	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty budget it's just him looking at the camera
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:59,327	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In front of a poster that says UT not fair
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:01,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To visit at

EDL	00:55:11,359	00:55:12,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Responses
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:15,455	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Of those about a hundred were
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:16,479	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Viable
EDL	00:55:16,991	00:55:18,527	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	With the 75 you throughout just
EDL	00:55:22,111	00:55:24,415	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Didn't think they would be sympathetic
EDL	00:55:24,927	00:55:29,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Whittled a hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic 7
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:31,071	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Number 1 or 2
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:32,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Did not
EDL	00:55:32,607	00:55:34,143	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Really want to go forward
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:36,447	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like I don't want the attention or they were fearful

EDL	00:55:37,727	00:55:38,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The backlash
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:44,127	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To make a long story short he ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:45,919	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hey my daughter just got rich
EDL	00:55:45,919	00:55:46,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Rejected from UT
EDL	00:55:47,199	00:55:47,967	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I heard you were looking
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:50,015	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I think I'm a very
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:54,367	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like a very like introverted person so I feel
EDL	00:55:55,135	00:55:57,695	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like sometimes it is a lot of pressure
EDL	00:55:58,975	00:56:04,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I think it's in the end it's totally worth it and and to be able to tab a voice
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:08,447	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	In this into know that my voice is making a difference is really reward
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:10,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	She seemed like the perfect planet
EDL	00:56:10,495	00:56:14,847	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Strawberry blonde hair she's petite she's kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way
EDL	00:56:15,359	00:56:16,639	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But last week
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:17,919	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They lost
EDL	00:56:18,943	00:56:25,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Sweet talk to him before all this happened so we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell on Austin news
EDL	00:56:25,087	00:56:25,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Paper that
EDL	00:56:26,367	00:56:28,671	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The night after the decision came down

EDL	00:57:20,895	00:57:22,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The fundamentally he's just implementing
EDL	00:57:23,199	00:57:24,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A strategy that was perfected
EDL	00:57:25,503	00:57:29,087	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	By the people he now ironically seeks to disenfranchise
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:31,135	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	On this is civil rights movement 101
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:32,671	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He's got laws if he doesn't like
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:34,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That he knows he can't
EDL	00:57:34,975	00:57:35,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Overturn
EDL	00:57:35,999	00:57:36,767	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Through an election
EDL	00:57:37,791	00:57:39,327	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Clemson failed Congressional candidate
EDL	00:57:40,095	00:57:42,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He had that Lust For for political power
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:45,215	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Couldn't get it through the electoral system but he found this other way
EDL	00:57:45,727	00:57:48,031	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'm to do it this is exactly what this is
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:51,359	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Okay so tell me this is one of the most
EDL	00:57:51,871	00:57:52,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fascinating
EDL	00:57:52,895	00:57:54,175	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Things about the story
EDL	00:57:55,455	00:57:59,807	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If we go back to remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy versus Ferguson
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:03,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Starting to not really I think is a good example
EDL	00:58:05,183	00:58:09,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	This is Susan Carr law professor at American University Washington College of Law
EDL	00:58:10,303	00:58:14,143	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Plessy versus Ferguson 1892 that was a case
EDL	00:58:14,143	00:58:18,495	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Where are the state of Louisiana
EDL	00:58:18,495	00:58:21,055	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Law which said that people of color
EDL	00:58:21,055	00:58:23,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	White people could not ride in the same train cars
EDL	00:58:23,871	00:58:26,175	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If you heard the story
EDL	00:58:26,175	00:58:28,735	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	This is how it goes with somebody named Homer Plessy
EDL	00:58:28,735	00:58:32,319	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Black man sits down in a white car he is arrested
EDL	00:58:32,319	00:58:34,879	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He decides to Sue and his case goes all the way to the Sea
EDL	00:58:34,879	00:58:35,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:58:36,415	00:58:37,695	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The thing about that case
EDL	00:58:38,207	00:58:39,999	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is that it was a total setup
EDL	00:58:41,023	00:58:41,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Leaving
EDL	00:58:41,791	00:58:48,191	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So we go back when Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups were out
EDL	00:58:48,191	00:58:49,983	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Obviously horrified by this but
EDL	00:58:50,495	00:58:52,543	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The railroad companies were actually
EDL	00:58:52,543	00:58:56,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Mad about this too because they thought it would be much more expensive to run the trains
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:58:59,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	If they had to have add additional training so they have
EDL	00:58:59,199	00:59:00,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	White cars in Cars of color
EDL	00:59:01,503	00:59:03,551	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And so right activist
EDL	00:59:03,551	00:59:05,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Companies
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:07,903	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They recruited somebody named Homer Plessy
EDL	00:59:09,183	00:59:10,207	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	78
EDL	00:59:10,207	00:59:11,743	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	White 1/8 Safra
EDL	00:59:12,767	00:59:15,583	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they sent him to go sit in a white car
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:16,351	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	On a train
EDL	00:59:16,351	00:59:17,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	He got into a
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:19,679	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	First class
EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:20,959	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	People's car
EDL	00:59:20,959	00:59:27,359	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they said somebody to go arrest him like they got a off-duty police officer
EDL	00:59:27,359	00:59:28,383	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Ashley hired
EDL	00:59:28,895	00:59:31,967	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You could do that at the time that you can hire a private detective to make
EDL	00:59:33,247	00:59:36,575	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And today they hired that person to sew
EDL	00:59:36,575	00:59:38,623	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Plus he gets onto the train
EDL	00:59:39,135	00:59:41,951	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The conductor comes by and plessis Lake
EDL	00:59:42,463	00:59:45,023	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Just thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black
EDL	00:59:45,023	00:59:48,607	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And the conductor says well in that case you're going to need to be on the other
EDL	00:59:48,607	00:59:50,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Car in the string Homer Plessy says
EDL	00:59:51,423	00:59:55,775	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'm good actually I I'm going to be staying right here and the conductor says
EDL	00:59:55,775	01:00:00,127	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	No really you have to move and Homer Plessy it says no really not going to
EDL	01:00:00,127	01:00:05,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Things get heated and eventually this detective that they've hired comes in and arrest him
EDL	01:00:08,575	01:00:09,855	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Brought a lawsuit
EDL	01:00:09,855	01:00:13,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with
EDL	01:00:13,183	01:00:13,951	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To challenge
EDL	01:00:13,951	01:00:16,767	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the US
EDL	01:00:16,767	01:00:17,279	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Supreme Court
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:21,631	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they were hoping that they would be able to establish
EDL	01:00:21,631	01:00:23,679	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	That the idea of separating
EDL	01:00:23,679	01:00:24,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The races with uncut
EDL	01:00:24,703	01:00:25,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Institutional
EDL	01:00:25,471	01:00:27,263	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But unfortunately they miss
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:30,079	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Calculated in the Court ruled that the law
EDL	01:00:30,079	01:00:30,847	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Was
EDL	01:00:30,847	01:00:31,615	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Constitution
EDL	01:00:31,615	01:00:33,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And what they got instead was
EDL	01:00:33,663	01:00:34,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Separate but equal
EDL	01:00:34,687	01:00:35,711	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Totally backfired
EDL	01:00:36,735	01:00:37,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	But
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:41,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It was this early example of this other way
EDL	01:00:41,599	01:00:42,879	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You know if you can
EDL	01:00:42,879	01:00:45,439	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Find a plaintiff for create a plaintiff
EDL	01:00:45,439	01:00:49,791	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You might be able to bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead
EDL	01:00:49,791	01:00:52,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The n-double-acp later pickup on the
EDL	01:00:52,095	01:00:53,887	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Today weather true
EDL	01:00:53,887	01:00:54,911	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Geniuses
EDL	01:00:54,911	01:01:01,311	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They perfected it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly unlike
EDL	01:01:01,311	01:01:05,407	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	For example in the early 1900s they do things like send
EDL	01:01:05,407	01:01:08,991	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	A black guy in a white guy all over New York City to segregated theaters
EDL	01:01:10,527	01:01:14,111	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And see if one of them was prevented from being seated
EDL	01:01:14,623	01:01:15,647	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And if they were
EDL	01:01:15,647	01:01:17,951	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	They would sue those theaters
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:21,279	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And when victories that way
EDL	01:01:21,279	01:01:26,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Then there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody could buy a house
EDL	01:01:26,399	01:01:32,799	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Or live on a block in with white people lives if they were African American so they were
EDL	01:01:32,799	01:01:39,199	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Create a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say you said you would
EDL	01:01:39,199	01:01:41,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	By the house but
EDL	01:01:42,783	01:01:47,903	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	I'm not buying the house because I can't live there white guys who's the black guy that was a manufacturer
EDL	01:01:47,903	01:01:48,671	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	2 case
EDL	01:01:48,671	01:01:50,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It was one of the
EDL	01:01:50,975	01:01:51,999	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	First victory
EDL	01:01:51,999	01:01:55,071	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And that's the case where Justice Homestead in
EDL	01:01:55,071	01:01:56,607	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Dissent that he ended up. Publishing
EDL	01:01:57,119	01:01:59,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Hey wait a minute this isn't even a real case
EDL	01:02:02,239	01:02:03,263	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	What's the time
EDL	01:02:03,263	01:02:05,823	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Anything that involves manufacturing a case
EDL	01:02:05,823	01:02:07,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Fomenting litigation
EDL	01:02:07,871	01:02:09,151	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	All of those things were
EDL	01:02:09,663	01:02:12,479	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Illegal to not just unethical but actually illegal
EDL	01:02:12,479	01:02:13,247	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Yes
EDL	01:02:13,247	01:02:14,015	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Criminally illegal
EDL	01:02:14,527	01:02:16,063	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Sienna's
EDL	01:02:16,575	01:02:22,463	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Something like how we see ambulance-chasing today the lawyers for the n-double-acp were very aware of AC
EDL	01:02:23,487	01:02:25,023	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And this came to a head in the 19th
EDL	01:02:25,791	01:02:27,839	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	ICP
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:30,399	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Wanted to get the court to end segregated
EDL	01:02:30,911	01:02:31,935	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Basically they wanted
EDL	01:02:31,935	01:02:33,471	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	To overturn Plessy versus
EDL	01:02:33,471	01:02:34,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Ferguson
EDL	01:02:34,239	01:02:35,775	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And the way they were doing this
EDL	01:02:35,775	01:02:40,127	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	You know they needed a plaintiff so the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to
EDL	01:02:40,127	01:02:42,175	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Meetings with parents and sort of
EDL	01:02:43,199	01:02:45,503	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Quietly in a subtly trying to ask
EDL	01:02:46,271	01:02:47,295	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Parents if they wanted
EDL	01:02:48,319	01:02:49,343	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	SOB's cases
EDL	01:02:49,343	01:02:51,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Virginia knew that they were doing this
EDL	01:02:51,391	01:02:53,439	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they tightened up these regulation
EDL	01:02:53,951	01:02:55,487	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It said you know you can't
EDL	01:02:55,487	01:02:58,815	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Drum up litigation to try to stop them from doing this
EDL	01:02:58,815	01:03:00,607	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	So the n-double-acp
EDL	01:03:00,607	01:03:01,375	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Sued
EDL	01:03:01,375	01:03:03,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And they took this issue all the way to the surf
EDL	01:03:03,935	01:03:04,703	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Tesla
EDL	01:03:05,215	01:03:06,239	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's essential
EDL	01:03:06,239	01:03:06,751	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Because
EDL	01:03:07,519	01:03:09,567	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	No matter how illegal it is
EDL	01:03:12,383	01:03:14,431	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Maggie's the Supreme Court said
EDL	01:03:15,455	01:03:16,223	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Actually
EDL	01:03:17,247	01:03:19,039	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Manufacturing litigation is
EDL	01:03:19,039	01:03:20,831	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Is a form of political expression
EDL	01:03:21,343	01:03:22,111	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Really
EDL	01:03:22,111	01:03:23,391	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And it is totally okay
EDL	01:03:23,391	01:03:25,183	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Like free speech basically
EDL	01:03:25,951	01:03:26,975	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	It's a way of
EDL	01:03:26,975	01:03:27,743	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Expressing your
EDL	01:03:30,047	01:03:32,095	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Teskey's litigation exploded
EDL	01:03:32,095	01:03:35,167	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	After this in the 60s and 70s a lot of other movement
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:38,751	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The women's movement Poor People's movement
EDL	01:03:39,263	01:03:43,871	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Saw the success of civil rights movement was having with these strategies that they adopted them is
EDL	01:03:44,639	01:03:46,687	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	And now I guess I'd include that blue
EDL	01:03:46,687	01:03:48,223	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	The founding principles
EDL	01:03:48,735	01:03:50,015	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Of the Civil Rights Movement
EDL	01:03:50,783	01:03:52,063	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Have been embraced
EDL	01:03:52,063	01:03:53,599	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	By the vast majority
EDL	01:03:55,135	01:03:56,927	| radiolab062916_moreperfect |	Noah's founding principles
