EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Is going to happen
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And so we're going to start
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	With this woman when I told my friends about it
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I kind of described it as a prison
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	What is a prison you decide to walk into
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Okay so this
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	This is Sarah Wolfgang I was a former trainee for

EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Parents

EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	It all started with her because when she was growing up I really never liked
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:58,176	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	School so my parents were kind of wanting me to do so
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:58,944	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Something else
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	You still wanted me to finish
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	School but
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They encourage her to try at acting

EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	When we were see the phone call they were like oh hey you want to come in audition for a K-Pop group and I was
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I actually did I did I really didn't want
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	To do it but then she thought maybe this will lead to an acting job so I went in and then they're like okay they put me in front of
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	The camera and then they asked me to

EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Sing
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And I'm not

EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Everything you know can be touched up
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:43,744	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Really well
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	To make a long story short they end up offering
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Of more than 5 year
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,144	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And as part of that contract
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	We were asked to move into the dorms
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	What are these
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Facilities that's all the agencies
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Is Hartford for their idols
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Training we described it like a
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	The boarding school all the kids kind of live together
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	6
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Or seven other girls
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And it was here that Sarah says the company basically kept them under lock and key
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Lock Us in there
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	But we weren't allowed to
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	It's like one of those cockroach
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Prisons
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Or like those ant prison
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	You can walk in but you can't lock out your way why is she doing this again
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	What
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Let me explain to you guys just like how phenomena
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Really huge
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	K-pop
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Kpop actually started in Korea in the early 90s
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	But like in the last five or so years if he's just build out into the
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,815	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	The world
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And by some estimates it was generating like around 5
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Billion dollars
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And then if you throw in like
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Kdrama K soap operas
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	We just called the how you wave
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That how you wave in 2012 was valued at 83 billion dollars
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Jesus
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And nearly all of this
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Is based on a kind of
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Fantasy
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Because K-pop stars are
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	You know products of fantasy world
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That's professor
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Computer studies at University of California Santa Barbara I study K-pop industry
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	You know
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Stars are the important forms of Manga and Anime and all these
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Unrealistic
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Figures
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That don't exist in real life
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	So
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They have to have
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:43,039	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Just so really beautiful face beautiful body and excessively long legs
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:47,135	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Pale skin flowing hair they're not
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	The creature of this world
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They should have been
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Yeah what they own that can only
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Exist in fantasy world and that fantasy that's what they're trying to manufacture
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	In those storms
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Like they wanted us to lose weight
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	So
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	We would wake up at like
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	For 5 a.m. in the morning and then go hiking Sarah says after the height they'd come back eat breakfast which usually cancel
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Turn up lettuce and they have dance classes singing classes and then we have lessons of I think
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They're calling humble lessons we're basically this guy would show up to the dorm
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	To Bow correctly
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	So like we would have to down Unison so that we seemed as like one big happy group
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They weren't allowed to have cell phone computers
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Or
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	A relationship of any kind
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	All companies pretty much
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Don't want you
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	You to be in a relationship
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And in fact

EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Foot by the fence to the extent that it defies all of our common sense
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Meaning I'll give you an example
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That's what I heard from Professor
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,655	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Kim and also writer
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Bacco on the editor-in-chief of Soul Beats KPOP
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,543	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Okay
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	2008 there was this new girl group
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,199	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Girls Generation Girls Generation
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Girls Generation member all girls group that was like
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Ocean appearing on live music shows and like
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:37,279	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Variety shows being promoted as like
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Cute and you know like the ideal girlfriend kind of idea
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Girls Generation would appear with boy bands you know who are also promoting at the same time
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Fruit such as Super Junior
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,991	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Ss501
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Dbsk
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Like standing next to each other on stage talking to each other during variety shows
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And this is where we kind of get into the cultural
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	There are several times when they're on stage with one or more of these boy band
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And there
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Kind of taking the microphone from the host or whatever
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And kind of just nodding their head where the boy bands are like doing these
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Deep bow
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Some of the fans are seeing this and they're thinking that
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Disrespectful
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Why would that be respectful thinking is that since Girls Generation is a new group
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	They should be buying much more deeply than theirs
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	In base or there their seniors
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Bing
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	A rookie group is a big deal in Korea because
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Seniority is something that people hold very strongly
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And so as a rookie you have to show deference to the superior Hino senior groups
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Just in the box that's how some of the fans were taking it but I mean aside from all that and this is the key is that
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Some of the fans thought that the Girls Generation girls were
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Flirting
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	With some of the boy bands
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Little Saigon glances or
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Teasing them it so that interaction seeing that
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Fans were very very very
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Upset about that
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And so
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	All the fans of the
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Three groups that three boy bands
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Got together
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And decided to do a black ocean

EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	But what I think is the most surprising part of the
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	3 days after the photos

EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I think she looks
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Sprouts or at least overwhelmed
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	But then

EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	She says

EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	For me the story shows that they're going to draw
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:00,128	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	A Line in the Sand
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That's different from ours
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,176	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	For now
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,504	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	For a long time or
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,528	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Can you say
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I mean
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,344	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	What I asked
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,112	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	AJ Park
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	The same question do you think that is going to go the way of the West
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:17,024	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I mean she said no way I don't think it's ever going to be
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	That way I know
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	I mean culturally Korean store a little more strict
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And also I think there's also a part where we look at the US
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:29,312	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	No like we see them as an example of let's not totally go there
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	So like a u.s. is a cautionary tale or don't ever get to that point guys
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	And maybe this is one of those ones where you really wonder like
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_podcast16kpoperazzi |	Is there a cultural difference that runs deep enough
