EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And a few years ago cuz I was 15 or 14 I can't remember which
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I have memory issues

EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana is filling out passport application and there are two boxes
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Male or female
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And Dana's like well I'm not either one of those
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:31,392	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And so they wrote in a third option
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Intersex
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:36,512	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Bye-bye basically apply for my passport
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Got talked to by the manager of the office
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You should be no side inside you. You cannot get this password
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And they turn me down and I
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Appealing you can appeal a passport app

EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah but I feel
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The passport office rejected the appeal basically saying male or female
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That's all we got from there I found legal counsel
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:12,864	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana and

EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Was it tale of words
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	How words have the power to shape the world
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I was an Air Force brat
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So we moved all over the

EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Only 18 months apart
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But they never really felt like one of them
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah I got Tuesday
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	When I start showering with
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Other boys in probably like the 5th grade
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Sorry

EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Book like the other boys would it look like a stuffed sausage it was little
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Didn't look right never felt right either
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	From when you were little
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Smaller ball like a girl
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The brothers tried to help or
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Trying to teach me how to do things better to use my hero 4 try to stick up for me but we will
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The world was a scary place
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	My dad was always gone flying and he was kind of a scary figure
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Mother she had
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	A backhand that wouldn't quit and she never play tennis
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And Dana says for some reason
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Their parents always kept a close watch on them
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,415	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Remember once in childhood
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	We are living on Arkansas the girl.
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Store had
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Lowe's cut out Barbie Walt doll clothes and when you know where is cardboard
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Barbies
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	She has those and we're playing with those
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	She and I
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	My dad caught
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I got my my butt
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Sprite and boys don't play with dolls
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	My brothers were able to do
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Somewhere that but I was allowed to
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I'll see you think like if your brother was playing the paper dolls with the neighbor it would have been a different response
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Did you have any idea like why
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Nope
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I knew something was different I just
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I have no words
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	My world
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,287	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Was very small
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I think you could say was partially because of that smallness
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	An effort to make the world
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Like a little bit bigger
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	In 1978 at 20
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You did
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That's so interesting because I would think that you would run away from the military after your dad
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Frozen air force of one of the stations
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What 260 Americans
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And I'll be getting there
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Day of captivity
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The Persian Gulf

EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,719	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Praetorian
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Beirut
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	How did it feel to be to be part of the military or at least away from home
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And away from your siblings in your parents
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It felt really good I felt a little free
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Free free of the confines
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Couple things happened when I was in the Navy
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	About 5 years ago
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	People started thinking I was
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I thought I did anyting
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	To encourage that I didn't date anybody to do anything
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Or do you remember how that started or why I was so
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Small I didn't go out
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Drinking and trying to pick up women with a guy
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	There was somebody on board my first job
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Who I guess it was
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,151	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Putting books and magazines
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Are my rock

EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Gay-p*** or something horn
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,831	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Are some books
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You could think that leaving gay p***
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	On someone's bed or bookshelf
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It's not that big of a deal or something
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Initiation thing or something
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But this was at a time before don't ask don't tell where if you are gay
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You were kicked out so
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,031	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I got caught up in
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Witch Hunt
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You're a one-point
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Which is a precursor to the NCIS
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The National Institute of security

EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	An announcement went out on the ship that said that they're going to do a test launch of one of the gigantic missiles on board
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But Dana didn't hear the announcement because they were in the super loud room
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Anna
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,255	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I get done with paperwork

EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The gun goes off
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,775	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Firing a 70lb projectile
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	20-30 feet away from my head
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Holy crap

EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Brain injuries are there that didn't say just go back where you find you know they didn't really realize how much

EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Telling time
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,383	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Needless to say
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	After the Witch Hunt
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And brain injury
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But I'm like
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	When I got out you know for years after I got out I think it was or a little bit longer I
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Started going to Colorado State University
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I was about
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	30 years old
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	During their first semester Dana was in
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	A poetry class
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And Dana says something in the words of those
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Poets and in the class discussion
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Christian to go see the college therapy
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I walked in and someone you know
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I think I'm depressed and I'm think I'm gay
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Tell me more about the why you thought you were gay
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Two things
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	All that confusion going on in my mind
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Am I a boy or girl kind of thing is I don't really know what the hell is going on with me anyway
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dennis's didn't really feel like a boy like the way other boys do
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It kind of felt like an off-kilter kind of boy
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What do you call that
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And then
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	All these
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Which France
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:41,279	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	In the Navy got me really excited thinking about
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Whether I was or not
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Like maybe those guys were seeing
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Something The Dana couldn't see it that that was true
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I thought well I must be a gay man
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Cuz I didn't know anything else
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I didn't know how any other term
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	We had gay lesbian bisexual and we had crossdressers
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Oh yeah sorry that you're like okay out of those options which one feels the most like me
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What I thought was
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I want the game a land
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:20,191	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You know I didn't date anybody but the therapist that Dana saw ended up recommending that they go join
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,471	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	This group on campus
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It was the gay and lesbian Alliance
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Which later became the gay lesbian bisexual Alliance
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That's how long ago was
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	This would have been 1989 ish
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah like walking into that

EDL	00:11:54,239	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	If someone started the conversation went bad
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Sign off on certain things
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah but they were very welcoming and I thought well at least there is a
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Place that I can hang out with people
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Accept me for being different

EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana is not just going to meetings but is protesting at the group because
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Cuz around that time something called amendment 2 was proposed in Colorado
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Local law that protect homosexuals from discrimination
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Amendment to close up in Colorado
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So

EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,231	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	They're just trying to figure out where they
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,791	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Stood and they were trying out of these terms like
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Bisexual

EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana says at this point
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I started to really wonder where is all this confusion
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Coming from
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So I started digging deeper
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Okay
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	A lot of stuff is going on what happened to me
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	As a child
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I had always have these like Memories
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Some of them
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Of having surgery as a kid being like 3 4 5 6 Indian Hospital
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So I was pretty much there alone most of the time
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	My grandparents visited me once my dad was her once
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	How many surgeries do you think there were
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I don't know
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I'm more than one definitely more than one
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Between 3 and 6 years old I have multiple
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I just don't know how many
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Only had like
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Tiny fragments of these memories
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It's hard to remember anything when you're 3 anyways
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But now in their 50s
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana started to look back in wonder
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What were those surgeries
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Also does that explain why I feel so different down there and like why I'm in pain I was in such a
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Pain that I was walking bow-legged
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Try to keep anything from touching it
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	If I started working out
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Penis surgeries
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,575	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Trying to figure out what happened there
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Okay I don't know what happened to me as a kid but I know I had this pain and I know I had the surgery so maybe they're connect
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Right so I started looking up that look a lot of different diagrams of penis surgeries
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	All these different types of thousands of different penis surgeries in mi
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Should I didn't know there was that many
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Erectile dysfunction surgeries
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Penis pumps
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Looking and then I'm like
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I was trying to match up scar tissue
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	02 that was your approach
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:11,391	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Am I approached you must have seen some gnarly photos
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,999	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	While searching all these photos on the internet Dana did start to see
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Images where the scar tissue like the patterns of the scars
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Looked familiar
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That's when I found this term
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Better sex in the Maya just popped up
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	On the screen that pops up on
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You want to do surgery things
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Intersex
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What the hell is that
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	So I typed in Anderson
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The internet was full of information
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Bills are really starting to go off
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Rain in my head drawing
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Baby
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And I was just starting therapy at the VA Hospital up in Cheyenne Wyoming
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Wyoming
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	She convinced me to go see a urologist at the VA
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And he confirmed yesterday that I was intersex
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What what does intersex actually even mean in your case cuz it can mean a lot of things like what
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Did one of the doctors say she was born with ambiguous genitalia and they constructed
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Basic Ray my genitalia look male
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Other words like Dana wasn't born with what the doctors would consider male or female genitalia it was like they
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Add something that seemed to be there in a large clitoris or maybe a small penis it was unclear
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And maybe there's a little bit of a vaginal opening
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And Dana's case and as is often the case
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Babies that are born this way
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Parents don't really know what to do in the doctor will basically say well you got to pick one
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And they picked mail
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I don't know exactly who made that decision I think it was my father
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,568	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Shut that off looks like a penis to me
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That sounds like my father
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But anyway
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The doctors
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	They constructed
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Apenas
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Should have been
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Large clitoris probably
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	How old are you at this point
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,976	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	When you figured all this out
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	50
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You are 50
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I'm 60 now 10 years ago
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:29,888	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Wow
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:35,264	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You are 5-0 when you finally found out that you were interested
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Next Step
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Dana says
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	When they figured all this out they had
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,432	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Two simultaneous
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Feelings one I was living
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Why didn't my parents tell
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,088	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Basically lion true my whole life
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Did you call them
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yes
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What did your mom say
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Not much
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	She basically was angry back at
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,728	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	She said your boy
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You're always be a boy
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Would your father still alive when you found out about the inter
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Oh yeah I called him to and what did he say
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Feeling hot a lot and kind of said he was sorry
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Which is where we start reconciling
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Did he
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Blaine
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Where he was coming from it all when you were alone you're a little
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	No not really but you know
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	How to learn how to forgive myself for all my anger with my parents
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And forgive them as well
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Medina says that like a mitts processing that rage
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	For almost a year
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Tell me about the Euphoria why
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Because I finally had an answer I mean it was a question I had asked and wondered about my entire life
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Open at Point
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The question being
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Am I a boy or a girl
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	The answer is yes
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Both
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That was you fart
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What does Euphoria feel like to you walking on air
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I know what I am and what I had to break the binary
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That was
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Break the binary
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Are you okay if I'm not a man I'm not a woman I must be
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Intersex or hermaphrodite
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	That works
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But it's not the question I should have been asking it was like who am I and those kind of things but
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You're saying the question you should have been asking is who am I not am I a boy or a girl
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Be kind of questions most people ask
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What Dana means is that those are the kind of questions most people get to ask
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But they were so forced
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Inter
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Like wondering if they were a boy or a girl that they never got
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	To get to like the big existential life questions that most of us
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	You know wrestle with they were just
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Way back at Ground Zero
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	But I got unstuck
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	What is it like me until I find a word that explains you
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	It was so cool
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	Ja
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I think it was probably the happiest times in my life

EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,144	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	I've actually would kick this whole password thing off
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	And in May of 2018 Dana and the state department were back in front of a judge arguing the case on its constitutional Mary
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18dana |	In September a judge ruled in favor of Dana saying that the federal government cannot refuse a passport based on face
