EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And they really wish they were
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That's right
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says he can't remember how many exactly walked in maybe somewhere between 4 and a dozen I'm trying to think of
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	They were they all came
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And then I supervise some cases
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And the training clinic at Stony Brook they all came
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Because they weren't happy
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And they wanted to change they wanted you to turn them from gay to straight
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And not wanting to
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Olympos my
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Heterosexual values on them some would say my heterosexist values on them
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I would check it out with them
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Can you tell me a little bit about what your
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Living situations like your social life and
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Xiamen apartment off campus
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	By myself
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	In fact the film
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Where I really roll played myself I wasn't acting but we did have a graduate student
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Play the role of a
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Troubled homosexual young man wanted to change
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You'll see in that film
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	A pretty reasonable
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Rendition have you ever previously
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	No
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I thought of going before then
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Terry says the film that he made with your hearing
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is survival composite of all the cases and Esau of this kind and what you see in the film is hems in a suit
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:56,991	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sitting in one chair
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Couple feet away from him is a young man with big 70s hair
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What's a mage
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And the guy explains that he
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Having trouble concentrating
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Having no
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Call trouble getting down to work it turned out
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But he was recently prices
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Buy an intensification of his long-standing attraction to men
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry says initially
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He had no idea what to do with these case
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	They were anxious
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Very depressed
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	These are folks who
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The kind of people could
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You know
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Commit suicide
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says he felt like he just had to help that's what I was taught
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That's what I was taught
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And so in the film
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You don't after maybe I don't know
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	15 minutes
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry says to the guy
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Outline for UA
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Now before we actually get in
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Procedure
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Just a little bit of context is necessary
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I not suggest
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sexually I'm taking a lot of waste time Jerry was not the only therapist in the situation there were a lot of therapist
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is around the country trying to quote help their gay patients
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Anything that we can do to prevent future Generations
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	From suffering this Affliction must be done
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The overall approach certainly did not start with me there were other people who were doing what we
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What's called behavior therapy with gays
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Most of it
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Was aversion therapy
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Turtle file Spanish comes from your body
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The odor so strong which was applying electric shocks when they saw pictures of
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Same sex people
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Or making them
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Nauseated
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	With injections we vomit again and again all over everything is one of the leading of
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Aversion therapist coming to Stony Brook where he's training at the time to give a lecture
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The guy showed 16 mm
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Films how it was done
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Hooking up gay men to electrodes to their fingers of their forearms show them pictures of men naked men
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Physical pain
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Do it again
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	This bothered me just personally this had the this is Bob the idea of an intense
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Ashley inflicting
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Physical pain on
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Other people
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I just worried about it
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It was cringeworthy
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Interesting Lee
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Doesn't fault the researchers who administer those shocks
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Pictures they were like dentist before Novocaine
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	2 in a pulling a tooth I'm old enough to remember
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What going to the dentist was like to get a filling or getting
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	A tooth pulled
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Before there was Novocaine
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Decide to write analogy
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It was your tooth hurts you need to have it pulled out you don't need to have your homosexuality pulled out of you may not think so
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But if if you're gay
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	In the 1960s
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Haunted and discriminated against
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	CBS News survey shows that two out of three Americans
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Discomfort or fear and being told that your
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	An evil person that you're disgusting these people need help and so what Feldman was trying to do
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Helping a eating aversion therapist who's the guy that showed
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That felt he was doing the best
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That he could given what was available knowledge
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah that's why I don't demonize
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,615	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	As Jerry is sitting there in the bathroom watching this guy Feldman show this film
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People being tortured
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He just kept thinking
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	She's do we have to do it this way
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The people were saying
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Well but it works and
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That's what the literature was telling us
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,023	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But I was thinking while other other ways to do it
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And so what Jerry decided to do was take the basic idea of aversion therapy
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And flip it
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So what am I supposed to do now I'm supposed to argue well
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I want you to connect to
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,615	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Follow Me If You Can I don't want to say now
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Nswc in the film he basically tells the patient
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Baidu
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Grab a copy of Playboy magazine
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You go to the nurse and get a copy Playboy was what I thought of as
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,279	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Source of material
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Attractive
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Women then he says when you get back home get yourself aroused or whatever you're cussing
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,007	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Think about a man think about his body
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Homosexual image
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	There comes a point
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You know
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The inevitable point
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	At that point of
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Inevitability switch over to the female picture
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Have you ever had your climax
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	My schedule was it said of shocking people into hating their Gay Thoughts he would gently encourage them to take their positive
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Gay Thoughts
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And map them onto a different body
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I fact I think the technical term was orgasmic reorientation
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,847	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And in the video apparently it's
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Seems to work
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	In the video of Jerry checks in with him about 10 times
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And the guy tells him it first
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It was really hard for him to finish the deed while looking at female pictures
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But then it got easier
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,415	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Any easier
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Until finally after about 10 of these sessions
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I really feel like I'm really getting into it now
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What happened was
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Every time I masturbated I found now
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Erin go straight through
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Without any trouble you know what
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Do you like you like what
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I think the thing I like most is I now see some direction I feel myself
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Moving
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Towards something as opposed to
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Not knowing which way I was
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	NFL
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And I think that's a good feeling

EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Kennedy's letter was titled gay is good and just a few years later post on wall
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That preys
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Would become the slogan of the entire gay rights movie
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And this is maybe the first time
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That phrases used

EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Okay so this is a little bit of a digression
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But I think it's one so worth taking that's James Peterson

EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	There is James reminded me
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I never even knew this
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Begin with
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Hugh Hefner's
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Intent with Playboy was just to show naked lady
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yashow philosophy
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	3 actually spelled out in great detail
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I call it the term paper
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That changed America
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Hefner was an under
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Graduate the first Kinsey Report on male sexuality came out
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:21,440	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Tens of thousands of people have cooperated it was a bolt from the blue
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It changed hafner's life it came out I think maybe
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	48 and it describes the range of male sexuality
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:40,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Without judgment Kinsey describe Nails on a range of
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	125 from Strictly heterosexual to strictly homosexual but in the Middle where
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Show me like 35% of American men had had a homosexual experience in their adolescent
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So the straitjacket was
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Release and what struck Hafner
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The indicated for the first time statistically the great disparity
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	This dissonance existed between
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Hyperfest
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Police and Thief
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The actual
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:17,248	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Actions of society between sex laws
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Versus what people were actually doing this is one good reason for
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Questioning some of the old morality
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And so I would have to start a Playboy along with the magazine and
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,304	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Playmates
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Along with all of the televised parties from the Playboy Mansion

EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The philosophy really I think
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Here's an anti puritanism
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And James says behind the scenes through the Playboy Foundation we were funding court cases it Advanced cave

EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Specifics of that Workshop
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Well I think it's clear that we have solved all the problems of things field has
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Because what's more consequential
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is what happens after the pain
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry is a hanging out waiting for the room to clear and this young young man walks
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Chubby he was a little chubby
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But my age

EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He came up to me
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Introduced himself as a graduate student
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Rutgers
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He said I you know I heard your talk
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I thought it was
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:03,904	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Interesting
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I'm actually give you talked myself the next day if I hang out some flyers for it
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And I said
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I don't mind at all of course
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Decision was made
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	2 attack
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We called The Gatekeepers
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Of American adults
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	This is Charles Silverstein he was at
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Young therapist in training with the flyer
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Vanessa Jeri he was gay
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Was part of a growing movement of activist
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	They were targeting people like Jerry
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The behaviorist
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Have a different point of view
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Unlike the Freudian weirdos
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Their scientists
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I would say
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He said the public trust at the behavior therapy
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	They had a lot of
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What's this way over public opinion so if they could convince Jerry and his colleagues
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That homosexuality was not something to eat the cured
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Maybe the public would go along
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The question was how do you do that
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	How do you make the case
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	This was around the time when gay activist would start
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Zapping meetings where they basically go to a conference with therapist for meeting
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Storm an event grab the mic and just take over
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Charlie's
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sense with this Gonzo approach
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Was not going to convince
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The people that need a convincing
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Like sharing so when he approached Jerry after that Workshop very polite
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And friendly simply handed him a flyer said hey mean if you folks are doing a thing come by
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Tracy just had a sense
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	His heart was in the right place
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So we thought maybe I'll take a different project
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I remember looking at the flyer
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And seeing
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:53,216	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I wish those radical gay activist all these troublemakers
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Man I've been called in Mike
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We haven't called a natzi
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Fascist
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So I remember looking at the flyer
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Say to myself well there's no way I'm going to go to this
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So he shoved the flower in his pocket yeah I wasn't interested went off to the next panel
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The following day finally the conference
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,928	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sunday morning checked out of the hotel
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And I was on my way to
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Leave Penn Station to go back out
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Stony Brook
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says on his way out he kept bumping into colleagues were like hey great Workshop love to Playboy therapy thing
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Until we stop wechat and at one point I looked at my watch
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You realized
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I could not make it down to Penn Station
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And I thought
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	How the next train doesn't leave Uno
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	3 hours later sending had some time to kill and for whatever reason the thought popped into his head
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The kid from Rutgers with a flyer maybe I'll go
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Because I pulled out the
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The flyer he gave me
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I hadn't thrown it away
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And I found the room
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Anna went to the room
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And it was a madhouse
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Choke the room was Electric in the sense that it was absolutely packed
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Charlie and two other gay therapist run stage there may be a few hundred people in the audience of the woodlands family Incredibles 2
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Fayette never heard
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	A gay person
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I mean a baby seem gay people interrupting attention but never
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Take Park
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	ISO in my
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Hollywood imagination of this moment people are shouting they're waving no no no no
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Charlie says this time he worked very hard to keep
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Professional respectful
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So it's at 2 it's it's
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Cordial
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But fierce
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I was at the top of my phone
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,664	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	When it came time for him to speak
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Charlie says he took aim
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That idea hit her
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People like Jerry repeat
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Over
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I only work with people want to change what's the
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What's the big deal
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That idea
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Usually said that
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We asked them to read the remarks
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Discussion of mail
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Homosexual
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To suggest
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The person comes voluntarily to change your sexual orientation
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is to ignore
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Powerful Environmental
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Stress oppression if you will that has been telling him
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	For years that he should change
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To grow up in the family where the word homosexual was whisper
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To play in the playground and hear the words faggots and queer
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To go to church and Harrison
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And then to college
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And here of illness and finally to the counseling center
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That promises
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Cure
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is hardly to create an environment of freedom and voluntary choice
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:43,200	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What brings them into the Counseling Center is guilt shame and the loneliness that comes from there
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	If you really wish to help them freely choose
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I suggest you first desensitize them to that guilt
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	After that it's listening to us but not before
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I don't know any more than you what would happen
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But I think the choice would be more voluntary and free
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And it is
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yes those are my
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Do you remember how those words hurt you
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	How it affected me very deeply
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Affected me very deeply
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,208	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry says he went to Penn Station
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	O'Charley's
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Speech into the counseling
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What is scale
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Echoing in his mind
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	52058 Broadway to 517 on the train back Stony Brook
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sat there staring out the window at the scenery thinking thank you
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So I was running through the whole talk
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	In my head
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says by the time he got to Stony Brook
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He felt something change in him
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:06,144	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I went to school the following day
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I know I began
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Talk to people about what
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I have just heard it
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The convention
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And how it's got me to thinking
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jesus teaching a series of undergraduate classes at that time and he would get up in front of the classes in for the first time think
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What if some of these students are
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:24,832	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	In the closet
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Talking to people
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Mulling things over talking to students
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I began to think no
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What I've been doing

EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And by the time the film began to be shown
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:51,456	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I was already
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Wishing that

EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Conference that you was held in Chicago it came at a time
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	A break
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Forever and
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Foment
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says in the days and months leading up to the conference
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People on
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	The radical left were calling us fascists and Nazis
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:34,464	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And they were publishing circulars were their home addresses
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Someone publish your home address absolutely
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We had the high was president of the association of time
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Remember we all had walkie talkies
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,960	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We hired
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Plain-clothes people in Chicago Police
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Because we were that afraid of violent
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:56,480	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Set the scene when you give the speech how big is the room big big room
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Big Ballroom
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Mm
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	These are all therapists
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And how are you feeling before the speech very nervous
EDL	00:34:04,160	00:34:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Terrifying
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He says before the talk he'd actually met Charlie at a diner and told them about the species
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Remember him saying
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You know that your reputation may suffer but have to remember that in those days
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	If you said something positive about a homosexual
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People will suspect you people may think that you're gay oh he must
EDL	00:34:25,920	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Okay that's why you saying he warned me he warned me
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:37,696	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Colleagues and my friends
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:41,536	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I want to make plane if not perfectly clear
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,352	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That I am speaking only for myself
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	On an ethical issue that impinges imported Leon artherapy Enterprise
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry began to talk by telling the audience I wish today to voice some concerns I have been wrestling with for over 3 years
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That he's troubled surrounding the way Behavior therapist
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,272	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And for that matter all other therapists
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Heaven approaching homosexuality
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:07,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Did he like a lot of the therapist in the audience
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We have been approached by client
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Gay men mostly
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Who want their help
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We made straight to us that they are troubled by their homosexual Behavior or feeling
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:21,472	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But then he asks Silverstein's question
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What is it actually mean
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To help you
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	A Silverstein put it at the aabt convention two years ago in a discussion of male homosexuality
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Let me court again
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To suggest that person comes voluntarily to change his sexual orientation
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:44,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Environmental stress oppression if you will
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It has been telling him for years that he should change
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Super All in the Family where the word homosexual
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Play who did you in that speech what was la
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That's quite please consider me the code from Silverstein
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:00,896	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What drinks stain
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And the loneliness that comes from their secret
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Another word Silverstein's suggest that we must go back in the causal Network
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And ask ourselves as determinists
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:13,952	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	What are the determinants of the client asserting to you
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That he or she wants to change
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Jerry that delivers the simple point which is that the problem that these people are asking us to solve
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is the problem we created
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,848	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That we labeled
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	As a problem
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And tell even if we could affect certain changes
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	There is still the more important question of whether we should
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I believe we should not
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,024	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To us now
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,328	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Too many of us now
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That may sound like kind of a simple easy obvious
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Thing to say
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Say everybody else was arguing
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is that the attempt
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,688	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	2 Chainz sucks
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Sexual orientation
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Ended in failure
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:11,296	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That was not what
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Keep that he did something
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Quite different
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,392	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He said
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And that's me
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,464	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It makes no difference
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,512	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	How successful the treatment is
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Is is
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Immoral
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Charlie says he was the
EDL	00:37:26,144	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	First person to say that to ever say
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:32,032	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That trying to change sexual orientation was in
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Immoral things
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And that's not a trivial thing
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That's one of the early Tremors in a tectonic shift
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Manchester view but all of science like science to that point
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,792	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Concerned itself with objectivity
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That was all that mattered
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,352	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We stand apart from the world
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And we examine it as it is
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,704	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Objectively but that
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	From this moment for it would start to be questioned all over the place
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Even in places like mental illness
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You know you look at history
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You see that some diseases come and go
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Why would that be
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People will begin to argue that even mental illnesses
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:24,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Are social constructs created by the society by the people who study them
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	With Jerry was doing here
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He was Shifting the language he was saying forget
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:35,008	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Objectivity forgetting bulshit empiricism
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Let's talk about that
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Let's talk about morality
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	We shouldn't do this
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Not because it doesn't work which it doesn't
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Because it's wrong
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:53,184	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I hope and I recommend that we continue to devote the necessary energy
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To the important shower
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Thank you
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:08,288	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You right about that moment like as you were talking about how like the air
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,336	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Felt in that moment you right
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:16,736	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Friends commented afterwards that one gets that kind of Silence when everyone in a room full of 1000
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	People stops breathing at
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	At the same time
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Exactly right
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I remember that
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I just remember
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That intellect what are they going to do
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	When I say this
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,024	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And it turned out
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,584	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	That what they were doing was holding their breath
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:39,520	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Did you eventually clap
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	But afterwards Terry says at the reception
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You walked in and it was like parting the Red Seas
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:52,064	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Nobody wants to talk to they're all looking at me and I remember
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,624	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	One person I will not name him
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	He came over to me and shook my hand and he bent over and give me a kiss on the cheek what didn't
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You like that because you said those things
EDL	00:40:06,400	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Yeah and I said
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	I said screw you
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	So it took a while
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	Gypsum board
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	They did start to come around
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:20,224	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	And get on the right side of History
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	It's not a straight line by any means but there is a line
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:31,232	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	You can draw between Charlie's words coming out of Jerry's mouth and the epically huge decision that these psychiatric community
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	As a whole would make

EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18unerased1 |	To do what we're doing because Christians have to fight the battle Christians have to fight this battle homosexual sin
