EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This story you'll get your sound of sun
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Begins with a woman or a man actually she was a very little girl

EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When I was a little kid I would be in the fourth and I just eat
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The forest
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And I know lots of kids
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:02,624	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Do that but I was going to say what do you mean you got down on all fours and just eat the dirt
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This is Suzanne Simard
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And so my mom always talks about how she had to constantly be giving me worm medicine because I was
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I always had worms she's a forestry professor at the University of British Columbia and might as well start the store

EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Spent every summer
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm in this world
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And her family included a dog named
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Cheeks and so in this particular summer when the event with jigs happened what kind of dog is jigs by the way
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He was a
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Not a weiner. He was a what was he
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You don't know what your dog what
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Basset Hound
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,520	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He was a beagle beagle he was a curious dog
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And on this particular day she's with the whole family they're all out in the forest
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It was summertime
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:00,224	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And cheeks at some point just runs off
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Into the Woods
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Rabbit whatever
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Couple minutes go by and all of a sudden
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We could hear this
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Barking and yelping and
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We were all like oh my goodness
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Texas in trouble
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When school
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The hope
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Family in the uncles and
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Aunts and cousins we all Rush up there
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Do they follow the sound of the barking and it leads them to an outhouse
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,480	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And when they go in there is jigs at the bottom of the old host
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Probably six feet down at the bottom of the Outhouse pit
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh dear we've all been you know
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Doing our daily business
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Falling in he's looking up at us
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Quite scared and very unhappy that he was covered in
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh and toilet paper and
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Of course we had to get jigs out I mean jigs was part of the family
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He was so deep down in there we had to dig from the five
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,200	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	To sort of like white in the hole
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Basically expanding it from a kind of a column of a pit to something that
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We can actually grab onto his
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Front legs and swollen.
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And so
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Digging away
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And jigs with you
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Looking up with his paws you know looking at us waiting and they're digging and digging and digging and all of the sudden
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She said she looks down into the ground and she notices
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A tall round with a sore that has been cleared away
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There are roots
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Enroute Sepang rootinest
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Greasy Tangled we're sitting on the exposed root system which is like
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It is like a mat it's it's like
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's just a mess of matter intertwining exposed roots that you could walk across the Never
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Fall through
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She said it was like this moment
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Wish you realize only
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is this
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Who are the world
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Right beneath my feet jigsaw provided this incredible
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Window for me
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	No ends digging EX
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	How many different
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Colors they were how many different shapes
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Afterwards that they were so intertwined
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	As abundant as what was going on above ground
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It was magic for me
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What's the what's the end of the story did jig
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Did you emerge as we pulled Tigs out
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We threw them in the lake with a great deal of yelping and
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Cursing and swearing and jigs
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Cleaned off
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But that day with the roots is the day that she began thinking about
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Forest
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Texas
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Underneath
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And now if you fast-forward roughly 30 years
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Even makes a discovery
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Lifeline
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	IND
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Amazing
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She's working in the timber industry of the time this is by the way what her entire family had done
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Her dad and her grandparents
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And when I came on the scene and 19 the need 1980 does a Forester
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We were into Industrial
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Large-scale clear-cutting in western Canada
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Huge machines
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Loaders and cats
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She says a Timber Company would move in and clear-cut
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	An entire
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Petrified Forest
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	MN plants and nutrients
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And my job was to track how these new plantations would grow
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And she said she began to notice things
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	One wouldn't be lyrics
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,671	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Like
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Trees of difference be
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Are supposed to fight each other for Sunshine right
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:30,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,447	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Other way so they can get to the sky
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,311	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But you was noticing that in a little patch of fur that she was studying if she had say
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tree next to us
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,127	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Fir tree
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And she took out the birch
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The Douglas fir became disease and and died
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There was some kind of benefit from the Birch to the fur
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There was a healthier Community when they were mixed and I wanted to figure out why
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Of course I could be at home any number of reasons why
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	No one trees affected by another
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But she had a kind of
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Maybe call it
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Xen recollect
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Flashback yes cuz she knew that scientists have proposed two years before
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The underground
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Economy
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It exists among trees that we can't see
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And she wondered whether that was true
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And so
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Design of experiments
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Figure that out
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It was a simple little experiment theater
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Recover them in
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Plastic bags
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Videos of plant the tree in a plastic bag and then I would inject
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,959	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Gaso tag with a with a knife
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Which is radioactive so these trees were basically covered with bad
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,335	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Exit within filled with radioactive gas
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,175	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Suck up to photo center
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So now they have the radioactive particles inside their trunk
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Are branches we had a geiger counter out there
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	As soon as we labeled them we use the geiger counter to 10 rounded up and down the trees and we could tell that they were hot they were
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I mean I do what she wanted to know like
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:04,607	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What's the radioactive particles
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Entry what happens next will they stay in the tree or where they go
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Down to the roots and then what have
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And what you discovered is
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	All these trees only cheese at work
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Totally different species
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:25,855	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We're sharing their food underground like if you put a food into one tree over here
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It would end up in another tree maybe 30 feet away over there
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tree over here
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm going to 4th Street over there and V street over there 6th 7th 8th 9th
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	10th 11th Olin all turns out one tree was connected
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	47 other trees all around it was like
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It was like a huge Network
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We were able to map
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The network
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And what we found was that the trees that were the biggest in the oldest
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Were the most highly connected
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	SOB you know we
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Identify these are kind of like hubs in the network
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And when you look at the map what you see or Circle sprouting lines and connecting to other circles also sprouting line at a
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Used to look a lot like an airline flight
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But even more dense
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Just incredible Communications Network that
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You know people have no idea about in the past because we couldn't didn't know how to look
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's definitely
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Crazy I mean
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You're out there in the forest and you see all these trees and you think they're individuals just like
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Animals right
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But no
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They're all linked to each other called The Artful amoeba
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It Scientific American
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Lincoln title
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I spoke to her with our producer lettuce Nassar
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And she told us that this
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This network
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He has developed a kind of a nice
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Funny sword name

EDL	00:09:54,943	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The world wide web web it sounds like Elmer Fudd it would wait with
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So this would wine
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is this just like the roots like what she saw in the Outhouse no no no no no
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Armoire
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Exciting than that
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And sophisticated interesting in the
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Astonishing
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A completely separate organism I haven't mentioned yet I mean this is
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Going
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What creature where we going I'm not going to tell you I'm going to
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Go there we might look for a song I don't know where you were that day
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Any chewing Stephanie danler intern
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Things are producer we decided all to go to check it out for myself
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Think I'm not telling you about
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We went to the Bronx
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	To the botanical gardens cuz we have to travel here in New York to get to actual Greenery Jackson was a beautiful green
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Sweat New York Hat
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And when we went up there we there was this
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,263	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Whole man waiting for us
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	An expert
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is that really
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	His name is Roy howling
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,943	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Unruly by the way comes out with the
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Strange
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's like a rake
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,551	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Hezekiah expandable
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's a truffle rake
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh that sounds dangerous
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I told her up there in this
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Old Forest with this guy
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He starts digging with his rake
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	At the base of the
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Cubs away the leaves he shoves away the topsoil
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And so now we're down there without a tablet
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We carefully examining the roots of his Oak Tree on our knees with our noses in the ground that we can't see anything
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But then
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Finally
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You have the length
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Gives us a magnifying
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Little Jewelers glasses handheld
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Any answer to an

EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh my gosh I do see them
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What do you say
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Threads attached to the roots smaller than an eyelash
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Maybe just a tenth the width of your eyelash
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But why
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Translucent
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Harry
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And while it took us a while to see it apparently these little threads in the soil
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And when you measure them
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	In a pinch of dirt
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What are pinch
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is it like as a plant
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is a what kind of creature is this thing that's what is it
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is the fungus
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Which by the way is definitely not
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Appoint
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There's some other kind of category in for a long time
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They were thought of as plants
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But now we know after having looked at their DNA
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The funds are actually
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,687	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Very closely related to animals
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,991	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They're one of our closest relatives Act
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Now back in the day
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Olga has a history of
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When people first begin thinking about these things we're talking in the 1600s they had no idea what they were
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,815	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What they did but ultimately they figured out that these things
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We're very ancient
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Because
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	If you look at
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,935	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	400 million year old fossils
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Some of the very first plants
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You can see
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Even in the roots
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,615	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Earliest land plants see those threads
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This is a really ancient Association
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,783	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm in later scientists finally look at these things under much more powerful Michael
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I realize the threads weren't threads
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They were actually
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tubes
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	How is little tubes
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Two tubes
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And the tubes branch and sometimes they reconnect
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So there seemed to be under the ground
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This fungal freeway system connecting one tree
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The next to the next to the next
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	People speculated about this would know what it actually proved it in nature in the woods
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Until
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And there was a lot of skepticism at the time
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Over the next
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Two decades we did
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,855	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Experiment after experiment after experiment
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That verified that story
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Suicide
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is this
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Why is this network even there like why would the trees need a freeway system underneath the ground to connect
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Why would the
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,399	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Why would the funds I want to make this
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Why are they going to this trouble
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Creating this big Network
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yeah well
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They do it
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Because
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tree has something the fungus need
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The fungus
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I something
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Trinis
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Let me just back up for a second so that you
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You came to set the scene for you
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,647	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When you go into a forest you see a tree or a tall tree so what is the tree do what
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This job sucks in sunshine takes the CO2 out of the air carbon dioxide which has carbon C
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	He in it
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And it keeps the sea carbon which is
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Science beaker
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	For food that turns into sugar
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,263	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What uses to make
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Its trunk
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And its branches
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The QC on a tree is just basically
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,895	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Are made into stuff
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Carbon and sugar the same thing
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You can think of carbon is basically the sugar that builds the tree
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	However
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	If that's all they had was carbon
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,879	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Isn't it only be this tall
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,719	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That's Roy again he's holding his hand
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Maybe a foot off the ground would be a teeny tree it would be smaller
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So if you could do is get carbon from the air
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,959	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You never treat this
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Size of a tulip
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A floppy tulip
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A tree needs
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Something else
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And what a tree needs
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm minerals minerals from the soil very similar to the sorts of vitamins and minerals that humans need
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Does a tree need nitrogen and phosphorus magnesium potassium and calcium in
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Why what did he do for the tree
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Like a tree stand up straight without minerals
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Twerking
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is important for making a tree stand up straight
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And lignin is
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Full of nitrogen but also
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Well, like nitrogen is important in DNA right it's an integral part of DNA
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I want to be a healthy tree and reach for the sky then I need
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I need rocks in May
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Somehow liquid rock to you need the nutrients that are in the soil
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And that's
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Where the fungus comes in
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The fungus
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:34,047	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Has this incredible network of tubes that's able to send out through the soil
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	End
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,839	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Drop water
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And mineral nutrients
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That the tree needs where I thought I thought tree roots just sort of did like I thought I always imagined tree roots what kind of like straws
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Pause like the tree was like already doing that stuff
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	By itself but it's the fungus it's
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yes in a lot of cases it is the
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Just because
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tree roots in a lot of plant roots are not actually very good at
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Doing what you think they're do she says the tree can only suck up what it needs through these
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Almost to the Teeny tips of its roots
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That's not enough bandwidth
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Which okay to the fungus is giving the tree the mineral
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is the tree giving back to the fungus
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,959	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Remember I told you how trees make sugar
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:14,239	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So that's
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Switch the tree gift
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The founder of sugar
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The funds I need sugar to build their bodies
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The same way that we use our food
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	To build our bodies they can't photosynthesize
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They can't take up CO2
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And so they have the
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The trading system with trees
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She says what will happen under the ground is that the fungal tubes was
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Stretch up toward the tree roots
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I meant they'll tell the tree with their chemical language I'm in the neighborhood
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Can you
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Will you
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,399	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Soften your route so that I can invade your roots
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,215	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And the tree gets the message
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And it sends a message back and says
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yeah I can do that
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Like I can start softening up my
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The walls and make room for you
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Animals little tubes will wrap themselves
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	In the place
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The little bits
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	White dress you can see the white stuff is the fungus
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And we saw this in the Bronx that the little threads just
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Wrapping themselves around the tree roots
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The last kind of part of the route
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Entangled stirring the edge
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And it's getting that little space between them that they make the exchange
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is century
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That would be
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Sugar sugar
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:21,055	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Benadryl sugar
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Mineral sugar
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I forgot to ask you something
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	82 if the tube system is giving the trees the minerals how is it getting it
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The minerals
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	How's it getting ready to pull in from the soil
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Well that's a mirror
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That's why
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That is
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I got a doing the story this is the part

EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,815	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson

EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Run this is Radiolab and what was it what was the answer
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Question about how did how did the fungus get the minerals
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It is a three-pronged answer
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What a fungus does is it
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,135	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It hunts
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Get mines it fishes
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And it strangles what I'm not making this up in 1997 a couple of scientists wrote a paper
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Which describes how fungi have developed a system
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,263	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Remaining Jennifer says that what the tubes do
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is the
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:03,359	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Worm their way back and forth through this
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Well until
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They bump into some Pebbles be little soil particles
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Packets of minerals and then say
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Acid amino acids come out and start to dissolve the Rocks like you're Drilling and the fungus actually build a tunnel
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Inside the rock can reach these little
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,816	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Packets of minerals
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Minam
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What if you look at these particles
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Under the microscope you can see the little tunnels that curve sometimes they Branch they look just like mining tunnels
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	This is very like if you had little helmet with a light on it like I'm a human maybe not with a helmet but yeah

EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:50,464	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Hunter what do you mean like the
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The plant is hunting for water
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,656	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is hunting how do you make how do you mean
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So there's a little insects that live in the soil just adorable little creatures called springtails
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:11,456	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Flea size and they spend lots of time munching leaves on the forest floor called springtails cuz a lot of them have a little Oregon
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The back that they actually can kind of

EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Put them all together in a dish
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And they walked away
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And then they came back
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And they found that
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Mosto springtails are dead
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Instead of eating the fungus
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It turns out the fungus
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Eat them
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	In the little Springhill bodies that were little
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tubes growing inside them
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And this is what makes it even more gruesome they
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Somehow have a Dye don't ask me how they know this
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:20,320	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	How to figure it out but they have a little stain that they can put on the springtails to tell if they're alive or dead
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When they did this
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They saw that a lot of the springtails
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That had their tubes inside them
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,304	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We're still alive
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Rule
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:36,192	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The fungus would literally sucking the nitrogen out of the Springdale
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Taylor was too late to get away nope
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Anymore
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:45,664	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And then they did experiments with the same fungus that I'm telling you about that was capturing the springtails
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And they hooked it up to a
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Tree to try to calculate how much Spring Hill nitrogen is traveling back to the treatwell
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	25% of it ended up in the trees
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,744	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So they figured out who paid for the murder
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is there anyone whose job it is
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	How to draw a little chalk outlines around the
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Springfield
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Inspector tail is his name
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is the only spring-trap with a trench coat and other
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Fedora
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I have even I can go better than even that
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Javier's
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They have found
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Entryway
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Like as in the fish
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	In the tree in the tree well
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	In a way how in the hell is apparently Bears Park themselves in places
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And grab fish out of the water and then you know to take a bite and throw the carcass down on the ground
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The fungi
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's rained and snowed in the carcass
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:47,360	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Seeps down into the soil a bit the fungi then go and they drink the salmon carcass down and it send it off
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:53,760	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	To the tree
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That's insane salmon rings in trees
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Saying there are forests
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That we are trees that decided to found
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Rough to 75% of the nitrogen in the tree
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Turns out to be
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Food from just
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Bears throwing fish on the ground you if you would take away the fish
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The trees would be like
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Blitz Harbour
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And in it and is it as dramatic in the opposite direction like the fungus to be given the
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Trees a lot of minerals
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I like the trees are so I can how much of their sugar
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Are they giving you the fungus will I ask who's Annabelle
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Like 2% or 2.00%
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	No I'm well people have been measuring this in different for us and ecosystems around the world and
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The estimate is anywhere from 20 to 80
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Percent will go into the Cabrillo Brown
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	20 to 80%
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'll go into the fallopian tubes into the into the roots and then into the
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Microbial Community which includes the mushroom team
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The point here is that the
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The scale of this is
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	That we didn't know this until very recently
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You have a forest
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You have mushrooms now it turns out that their Network and together they're capable of doing that
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A behaviors for Restoril Behavior
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:12,352	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Did a deep cleaning
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We just learning about them.
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Under sew in
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Let's say it's times are good the tree has a lot of sugar I don't really need it all right now
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:29,248	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'll put it down in my fun July
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And then when times are hard
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The funds I will give you my sugar back
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And I can start growing again
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Give me the fun Joe give me my sugar back
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:41,024	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It is like a bag
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She says we now know the trees give each other load
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh yeah back and forth seasonally
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They can also send warning signals
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Through the fungus we've done experiments and other people in different
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Labs around the world
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,896	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	They've been able to figure out the different trees injured
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:01,760	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	People cry out to the kind of chemical weigh
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	And those
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Chemicals will then move through the network in Warren
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Neighboring
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Trees are seedlings that something bad is happening and I'm under a tack
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There's an enemy in the midst
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So if a beetle where to invade the forest
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	The trees tell the next tree over
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Here come the Paul Revere
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Sort of yes that seems to be what would happen
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Chicken you can see this is like a game of telephone one tree hill
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Start producing chemicals that taste really bad
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So the Beatles don't want him
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I don't want that
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What are the spookiest examples of
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:41,696	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Suzanne mention
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:45,024	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is an experiment that she and her team did where they discovered
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But if a ferret is warming up
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,376	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	What is happening all over the world
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Temperatures are rising
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:56,544	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You have trees in this Forest that are hurting I don't do well in warm temperatures and their needles turn off 6
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yellow they will send out a good signal
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But also
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Important thing we figured out is that as those trees are injured and dying
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Dumpster carbon into their neighbors so so carbon will move from that dying tree so it's real
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Resources at Legacy will move
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Into the microphone Network into neighboring trees
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Oh so it says to the new or the healthier trees
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Here's my food
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Take it it's yours
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Or it could be like okay
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm not doing too well so I'm going to hide this down here in my mycelium a bank or if you're a
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So it's not necessarily saying give it to the new guy
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We don't know it again it's a tree
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'm just trying to explain make sure I understand I realize that none of these conversations you actually
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Spoken give it to the new guy give it to the news
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Yes
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Suzanne said she's not sure if the tree is running the show and say like
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	I'll give it to the new guy
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's the fungus under the ground is kind of like a broker and decides who gets
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:02,080	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You know I don't completely understand
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	She has one of the weirdest
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Parts of this dog
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:08,992	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is wincek trees give up their food The food doesn't usually go to there
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,760	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Kids
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Or even the trees are the same
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Species what the team Fair
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Is the food ends up very often with
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Trees that are new in the forest and better at surviving global warming
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	It's as if the individual trees
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Somehow
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Thinking
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:24,608	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Ahead
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,424	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	To the needs of the whole forests
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:31,776	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	So we know that Douglas fir will take a dying to go through will send carbon to neighboring
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Ponderosa pine
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Answer why is that so and I think that you know the whole
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Forest then
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	There's an intelligence there that's beyond just
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Wait a second wait a second you just used
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	A very
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Twisting words
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Robert
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	You know what it's
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	10
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	All right
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Unfortunately right at that point Suzanne
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,888	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Basically ran off to another meeting
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	But
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:00,704	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Lou's Gun speaking
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	We could catch up with her a few weeks later
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:08,128	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	When we last left off I'm just saying you just said in
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast16trees |	Intelligent
