EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,671	| radiolab012915 |	Specifically for American Indian children
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:06,559	| radiolab012915 |	It was kind of radical experiment children will be taken removed for several years at a time
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:12,191	| radiolab012915 |	They would be stripped of their I was call their Savage Heritage and they would be civilized

EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,623	| radiolab012915 |	And they told us it Pratt basically made that pitch
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| radiolab012915 |	Save the man
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,231	| radiolab012915 |	Not just to Congress but directly to American Indian families
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,279	| radiolab012915 |	All over the country I want your son
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:43,679	| radiolab012915 |	Is that how does that work I want your children because white people are going to keep coming and coming they want to settle

EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| radiolab012915 |	She forgot

EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:26,495	| radiolab012915 |	We just think about this for a second just think
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:33,663	| radiolab012915 |	We spoke with one guy oppressor Eric Anderson who teaches at Haskell is us apart Potawatomi just
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,687	| radiolab012915 |	Imagine the parents
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,247	| radiolab012915 |	The first time they see their kids
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,831	| radiolab012915 |	Parents are seeing their students marched around in
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,135	| radiolab012915 |	Essentially the uniform of
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,951	| radiolab012915 |	What had not
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,767	| radiolab012915 |	Very long before for many of the tribes been
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| radiolab012915 |	The uniform of the enemy
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,863	| radiolab012915 |	At the very least
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| radiolab012915 |	I think that would be
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,447	| radiolab012915 |	Startling
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,335	| radiolab012915 |	According to Sally Jenkins after the kids were recruit
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| radiolab012915 |	And we dressed
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:07,967	| radiolab012915 |	Brentwood running through a bunch of drills in Carlisle was a little Military Academy
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:14,367	| radiolab012915 |	The Indian kids were so unhealthy at first they have been put on an unfamiliar diet they had been sleeping indoors
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:19,487	| radiolab012915 |	For the first time in their lives and a lot of them were getting sick we know that in the 39-year history of the school
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,023	| radiolab012915 |	At least
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| radiolab012915 |	200 kids
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:22,815	| radiolab012915 |	Died
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:23,839	| radiolab012915 |	Of disease
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| radiolab012915 |	Poor health or even home sick
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:29,727	| radiolab012915 |	And she was constantly trying to get the kids outside
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| radiolab012915 |	And
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,055	| radiolab012915 |	At a certain point he hired some teachers
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,103	| radiolab012915 |	Sally thinks that one of those tires
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,919	| radiolab012915 |	Probably one of the first dormitory Masters
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,967	| radiolab012915 |	This guy who had formerly taught at Ivy League
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,271	| radiolab012915 |	School he showed the Carlisle Indian kids
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| radiolab012915 |	This game with the kids at Harbor playing
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,623	| radiolab012915 |	Maybe he thought it would toughen him up
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,159	| radiolab012915 |	Knows but suddenly
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| radiolab012915 |	They're playing football
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,255	| radiolab012915 |	No keep in mind this is
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,559	| radiolab012915 |	You know at a point like an 1882 where
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,095	| radiolab012915 |	Football's barely a thing
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:02,495	| radiolab012915 |	Not so many schools had teams it wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then they were volunteer coaches who tended to Beast
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:08,895	| radiolab012915 |	Students are asked students for the Carlyle kids self-organized level the field start to play they even start a scrimmage some kids across
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,943	| radiolab012915 |	West Town and at one of those games
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| radiolab012915 |	Call you Barbara
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:17,343	| radiolab012915 |	Staci Matlock who is upon a student at Carlisle later became a Pawnee chief
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,879	| radiolab012915 |	He broke his leg
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| radiolab012915 |	Playing football in Pratt that's it
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,999	| radiolab012915 |	Football
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:27,327	| radiolab012915 |	Is in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids in football was doing the opposite
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,399	| radiolab012915 |	But
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,679	| radiolab012915 |	Showtime later
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:37,567	| radiolab012915 |	Set David Adams approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came into Pratt's office they said we want to play football
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,199	| radiolab012915 |	Do we know what they said exactly we don't have we don't have the exact words
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| radiolab012915 |	My Pratt says at one point
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| radiolab012915 |	He says while they stood around my desk
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,647	| radiolab012915 |	I'm calling your mother stood around my desk there black eyes intently watching
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,535	| radiolab012915 |	This is the order gave practically all the arguments in favor
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,351	| radiolab012915 |	About contending an outside football
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,887	| radiolab012915 |	And ended up
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,191	| radiolab012915 |	Requesting the removal of the Embargo
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,751	| radiolab012915 |	According to his Memoir Pratt was
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:11,103	| radiolab012915 |	Sore bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the peel
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,127	| radiolab012915 |	Suicide
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| radiolab012915 |	Okay you can play

EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:26,975	| radiolab012915 |	And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,511	| radiolab012915 |	And
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:32,863	| radiolab012915 |	At that early Point American football team was yell
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:39,263	| radiolab012915 |	Which brings us to October 24th 1896

EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:50,175	| radiolab012915 |	I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker in the early 1880s your contact with an American Indian
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| radiolab012915 |	Was in a wild west show
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| radiolab012915 |	It was theater
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,015	| radiolab012915 |	And here comes a football game
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:59,391	| radiolab012915 |	And all of these American Indian kids run onto the field and there's literally an instance
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,927	| radiolab012915 |	In one of the first games
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,487	| radiolab012915 |	Someone in the audience says will they look just like our boys
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,279	| radiolab012915 |	Because of course
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,303	| radiolab012915 |	That's a pratt wanted
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:13,471	| radiolab012915 |	Now one thing it was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlyle players was that they were physically outmatched
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:22,175	| radiolab012915 |	The impression going in as it'll be an absolute smear job
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| radiolab012915 |	But they released the odds are heavily against
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:24,991	| radiolab012915 |	But
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:33,183	| radiolab012915 |	3 minutes into the game in the midst of a big pile up
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:39,583	| radiolab012915 |	Fumbles the ball becomes squirting out
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| radiolab012915 |	Carla guy picks it up
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,935	| radiolab012915 |	And runs
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:46,495	| radiolab012915 |	The entire length of the field 63 yards
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:52,127	| radiolab012915 |	Scores a touchdown
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,639	| radiolab012915 |	Now
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:59,295	| radiolab012915 |	Nobody had scored on Yale and seven games they were Furious so what they do is they use their bulk
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,831	| radiolab012915 |	Two slowed
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:04,415	| radiolab012915 |	Push the pile down the field
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| radiolab012915 |	Twice
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:10,047	| radiolab012915 |	To take leave and the three minutes left
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:14,143	| radiolab012915 |	Get what's up 12 to 6 Carlisle has the ball
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:21,055	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle running back charges the pile in gets clobbered falls backwards
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:27,199	| radiolab012915 |	Just as he's about to hit the earth he laterals the ball to a teammate
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:39,487	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game but
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:41,791	| radiolab012915 |	It's called back
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,327	| radiolab012915 |	Bye
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| radiolab012915 |	A referee
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,631	| radiolab012915 |	Who was the Yale man
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:51,007	| radiolab012915 |	Why the call was that the referee claimed that a whistle had blown
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,031	| radiolab012915 |	The play dead
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:54,079	| radiolab012915 |	It was a crowd reaction
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,127	| radiolab012915 |	Well they were they were Furious
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,919	| radiolab012915 |	Yes there was bullying on
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:04,063	| radiolab012915 |	And putting everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of justice and some of the Carlyle players head
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,599	| radiolab012915 |	We are leaving this game
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,391	| radiolab012915 |	But according to David
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:13,535	| radiolab012915 |	At the last moment Pratt runs down from the stand coming onto the fields of ways I don't forget rule number one
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,095	| radiolab012915 |	Be a gentleman
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| radiolab012915 |	Pratt did not want
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| radiolab012915 |	This game to end
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:22,239	| radiolab012915 |	Because of their tempers even though they've been wrong
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,007	| radiolab012915 |	Bye
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| radiolab012915 |	By that call
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,311	| radiolab012915 |	So the Cowboys
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:25,823	| radiolab012915 |	Finished
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| radiolab012915 |	And when they walk off the field
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:40,159	| radiolab012915 |	They get a standing ovation
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,975	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle wins incredible respect in renown
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,559	| radiolab012915 |	In the aftermath of the game in fact one of the newspaper men
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,607	| radiolab012915 |	After another Carlisle Yale game or something
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,375	| radiolab012915 |	Similar happy
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:55,775	| radiolab012915 |	Wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11-year men but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a yield
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:58,591	| radiolab012915 |	Referee yes
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,687	| radiolab012915 |	After the Yale game of 1896 Pratt
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,223	| radiolab012915 |	Is committed
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:09,855	| radiolab012915 |	Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:14,207	| radiolab012915 |	It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:17,535	| radiolab012915 |	Years at the Carlisle school which is to prove the value
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,095	| radiolab012915 |	Are these American Indian kids against their white peers
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,143	| radiolab012915 |	Through the valley where the quote civilized
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,191	| radiolab012915 |	Civilize them
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:30,079	| radiolab012915 |	But also to prove that given education and equal opportunity they were the equal of there
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:32,639	| radiolab012915 |	That's another white Pierce
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| radiolab012915 |	I mean he was
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:38,783	| radiolab012915 |	For all of his forcible assimilation methods which were to remain extremely cruel
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,575	| radiolab012915 |	And destructive
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,343	| radiolab012915 |	Keep
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,367	| radiolab012915 |	I truly believed
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,183	| radiolab012915 |	In the concept of of racial equality
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,231	| radiolab012915 |	The complicatedness
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,999	| radiolab012915 |	Pratt
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,791	| radiolab012915 |	Ahold Carlisle idea
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:56,959	| radiolab012915 |	Kep smacking ass in the face as we were putting the show together I mean on the one hand they were clearly students who felt that Carlisle was prison
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,751	| radiolab012915 |	Is that Barbara Landis
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,335	| radiolab012915 |	When she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle Indians
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| radiolab012915 |	Squishies
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,175	| radiolab012915 |	Kids weaving Set Fire to the buildings
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:12,575	| radiolab012915 |	It's that yes M did burn down which is kind of typical on Indian campuses
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,135	| radiolab012915 |	Fires in burning building why
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,208	| radiolab012915 |	Is a form of resistance
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| radiolab012915 |	On the other hand
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,608	| radiolab012915 |	When will you start looking around for original archival recordings of
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:31,008	| radiolab012915 |	See the earliest Carlisle players pretty much the only recording me to find
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,800	| radiolab012915 |	Much of your making is possible
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:36,128	| radiolab012915 |	With this oral history with a guy named
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:37,664	| radiolab012915 |	Andrew
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:45,088	| radiolab012915 |	Albert exendine
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,648	| radiolab012915 |	1899
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| radiolab012915 |	You are 15 years old
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:54,560	| radiolab012915 |	Can't really play you too much of this cuz the audio quality is really bad but in the interview
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| radiolab012915 |	Brad comes up
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,120	| radiolab012915 |	Be alright
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,496	| radiolab012915 |	And xidan talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,824	| radiolab012915 |	Time is it father of King in education
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:07,616	| radiolab012915 |	Call the father of Indian education
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:17,088	| radiolab012915 |	Man so he's a tough figure Pratt he's got a very mixed Legacy I mean I like to say Pratt was his country
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,440	| radiolab012915 |	Whatever you think of him he was his country
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,512	| radiolab012915 |	It's okay so 1896 he gets
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,536	| radiolab012915 |	The body
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,584	| radiolab012915 |	FootballScoop ER yes
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,912	| radiolab012915 |	What happens next
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:33,472	| radiolab012915 |	He begins looking around for coaches full-time coach
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,752	| radiolab012915 |	Just to come in and coach
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| radiolab012915 |	The team
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,568	| radiolab012915 |	And he whines up
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,360	| radiolab012915 |	With a Cornell grad
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:41,664	| radiolab012915 |	Name Pop Warner
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:47,552	| radiolab012915 |	Glenn Pop Warner
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:49,344	| radiolab012915 |	Is this part right here
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:51,392	| radiolab012915 |	Just to give you a visual
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:57,792	| radiolab012915 |	Harbin Kerasotes pictures looks kind of like Mike Ditka
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,840	| radiolab012915 |	If Mike Ditka head Einstein's hair
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:02,144	| radiolab012915 |	Pops a little bit of a of an outlier
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,448	| radiolab012915 |	History status Texas routes
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:09,312	| radiolab012915 |	He's a bit of a rogue can be kind of vulgar
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:12,896	| radiolab012915 |	Party a little bit really
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,968	| radiolab012915 |	And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| radiolab012915 |	When he gets the Carlisle
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:20,576	| radiolab012915 |	Because popwarner looks at his Squad and he realizes that
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:24,160	| radiolab012915 |	Sure they're fast they got heart but they're underweight and they're small
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:30,304	| radiolab012915 |	Waste all your well they might occasionally force a tie with it with a Yale if they you know
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,328	| radiolab012915 |	Have killed themselves
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| radiolab012915 |	Physically
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:36,448	| radiolab012915 |	They weren't going to beat the ivy League's on any kind of consistent basis without
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:38,240	| radiolab012915 |	Without doing something different
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| radiolab012915 |	And dumb
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:42,336	| radiolab012915 |	There's a very fine line between innovation
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,104	| radiolab012915 |	And cheating
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:48,736	| radiolab012915 |	And Pop Warner starts at exploiting that line absolutely
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| radiolab012915 |	As hard as he can
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,296	| radiolab012915 |	And he comes up with
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,856	| radiolab012915 |	The trick play
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,904	| radiolab012915 |	For example 1903
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,208	| radiolab012915 |	Pop Warner devices the hidden ball trick
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,720	| radiolab012915 |	But what is that
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:03,584	| radiolab012915 |	Hidden ball trick is the quarterback takes the ball
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:07,680	| radiolab012915 |	And actually behind the shooter pile of men
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,472	| radiolab012915 |	Tucks it under another guy's sweater
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:17,152	| radiolab012915 |	While the big pile of man is struggling in the mud in the center of the field not knowing quite where the football is but believing it's some
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:23,552	| radiolab012915 |	Summer in the middle of the pile with the football
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:29,952	| radiolab012915 |	Before anybody realizes it how did you keep the ball from falling out of his jersey I think they actually
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:36,352	| radiolab012915 |	Show The Jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out a cheating pocket native cheating
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:41,216	| radiolab012915 |	Pocket without legal because they got together legitimate touchdown was it legal you ask
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,520	| radiolab012915 |	Pop Warner would have said
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:46,080	| radiolab012915 |	There was nothing in the rulebook against it
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:49,152	| radiolab012915 |	Does which actually work brilliantly
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,176	| radiolab012915 |	Is a
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,992	| radiolab012915 |	He sews footballs
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,272	| radiolab012915 |	On to the front of their
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:25:01,440	| radiolab012915 |	Jersey's which were really bulky sweaters at the time he sews leather football-shaped patches onto the front of
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:07,840	| radiolab012915 |	Their jerseys in order to try to disguise who's got the ball
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| radiolab012915 |	Ivory Coast goes insane
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:15,776	| radiolab012915 |	Black
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:22,688	| radiolab012915 |	Harvard did not take this lying. Harvard retaliates by painting the footballs the same color
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:29,088	| radiolab012915 |	As their jerseys it's maroon everywhere so when they basically
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:35,232	| radiolab012915 |	You can't see it American football is essentially a rule-breaking experience
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,280	| radiolab012915 |	As opposed to British football which
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,560	| radiolab012915 |	Didn't have referees
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,376	| radiolab012915 |	At least initially a British football ran on the on Earth
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,912	| radiolab012915 |	But with American football
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:47,264	| radiolab012915 |	The rest were there practically from the beginning and she says it was largely a response
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,848	| radiolab012915 |	The brutality the game but also to the kind of rule-bending
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:57,248	| radiolab012915 |	That you saw from Pop Warner in the Carlisle Indians Every Time popcorn and came up with an innovation the next year there was a
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:57,760	| radiolab012915 |	Rule against it
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:01,856	| radiolab012915 |	So immediately I believe we get together and pass a rule and say okay no more of that
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,160	| radiolab012915 |	NFL rulebook really virgins
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:06,720	| radiolab012915 |	In American football and it's thanks to Pop Warner
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:10,304	| radiolab012915 |	Sleight of hand and pop Warner's greatest sleight-of-hand
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,840	| radiolab012915 |	And maybe
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,632	| radiolab012915 |	The Carlisle Indians most
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| radiolab012915 |	Soaring moment and I mean that literally
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,704	| radiolab012915 |	Happened
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,776	| radiolab012915 |	At a moment when the game almost disappeared
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:21,568	| radiolab012915 |	That's coming out
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,064	| radiolab012915 |	Start of message

EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:07,392	| radiolab012915 |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,464	| radiolab012915 |	This summer
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| radiolab012915 |	And I request
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:18,144	| radiolab012915 |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,960	| radiolab012915 |	About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:25,568	| radiolab012915 |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:29,664	| radiolab012915 |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| radiolab012915 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:34,784	| radiolab012915 |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| radiolab012915 |	To you
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,856	| radiolab012915 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:41,952	| radiolab012915 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:46,816	| radiolab012915 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,376	| radiolab012915 |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,656	| radiolab012915 |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:54,752	| radiolab012915 |	Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,288	| radiolab012915 |	If you have a story

EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:28,032	| radiolab012915 |	I'm rubber Coolidge is Radiolab and getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian School and the
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:29,056	| radiolab012915 |	Birth
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,824	| radiolab012915 |	Of the
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,360	| radiolab012915 |	Monogama football
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:36,736	| radiolab012915 |	What is the most important moments in the story I happens at a time when football it was right on the edge
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,016	| radiolab012915 |	Disappearing
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:41,856	| radiolab012915 |	Timeout 1905
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,624	| radiolab012915 |	This was
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,696	| radiolab012915 |	The most violent year in football today
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:50,304	| radiolab012915 |	19 people died on the football 19
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,608	| radiolab012915 |	19
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:57,984	| radiolab012915 |	That's crazy cuz what would happen is that Carla will try and do these things to throw to open up the game
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:02,848	| radiolab012915 |	The Ibis would consistently respond by making the game more about Brute Force more about violence
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:07,200	| radiolab012915 |	So you had all these debts and suddenly all the major programs were spooked
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,760	| radiolab012915 |	Columbia polls are their football team
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:16,416	| radiolab012915 |	Harvard even think about doing that and so and this is kind of odd Into The Fray steps the president of the United States of America
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:17,440	| radiolab012915 |	Teddy Roosevelt
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,512	| radiolab012915 |	The conrad beijing
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,560	| radiolab012915 |	He'd like football he like the
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:26,656	| radiolab012915 |	The manly aspects of it's a tough aspects of it but nobody like people dying
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,472	| radiolab012915 |	And then there was his his his son
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:30,752	| radiolab012915 |	What's playing
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,312	| radiolab012915 |	And and getting beat up pretty badly as well
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| radiolab012915 |	Broke his nose
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:37,408	| radiolab012915 |	Plated eyebrow the one game he got knocked out cold
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:39,712	| radiolab012915 |	So after the violence about 5
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,480	| radiolab012915 |	The president
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,040	| radiolab012915 |	Calls the president of all these colleges in Suwanee
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:46,368	| radiolab012915 |	The Washington and according to David Adams he basically tells
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:49,440	| radiolab012915 |	That the rules had to be Rewritten it had it become
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:52,000	| radiolab012915 |	A little bit more safe at least or it would be bad
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,072	| radiolab012915 |	In out of that we see a couple of roaches
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:58,400	| radiolab012915 |	China's first school to side in order to loosen up the
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:58,912	| radiolab012915 |	Pile
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,240	| radiolab012915 |	They're going to Tinker with the
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,056	| radiolab012915 |	Down yardage ratio
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,848	| radiolab012915 |	3 Downs of game 5 yards of pea
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,128	| radiolab012915 |	3 Downs.
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,408	| radiolab012915 |	10 yards
EDL	00:30:09,408	00:30:10,688	| radiolab012915 |	Renounce
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,224	| radiolab012915 |	4 weeks
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,504	| radiolab012915 |	Bubble years later
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,784	| radiolab012915 |	Is that the second rule change
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| radiolab012915 |	Just may be the most
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,320	| radiolab012915 |	Important
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,344	| radiolab012915 |	Raise for the first time
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| radiolab012915 |	They legalize the ability
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| radiolab012915 |	To move the ball
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| radiolab012915 |	Through
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,000	| radiolab012915 |	Free floating air
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| radiolab012915 |	Surrounds us all
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:30,400	| radiolab012915 |	Okay so where do we go to the next today sick if I could if I could
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:33,472	| radiolab012915 |	Replace you in a moment unless there's a moment before this you'd like to hit
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,520	| radiolab012915 |	I believe
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,568	| radiolab012915 |	November 23rd 1907
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:41,920	| radiolab012915 |	Yes your big moment okay can you set the scene
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,784	| radiolab012915 |	From the standpoint of broader American history things have gone airborne
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:54,720	| radiolab012915 |	You mean Wilbur and Orville Wright 1960
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:01,888	| radiolab012915 |	There are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world in France
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:05,216	| radiolab012915 |	Everyone is experimenting with flying machines things are going up in the air
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,032	| radiolab012915 |	But not so fast with football because
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:13,152	| radiolab012915 |	When the rule committee had made that rule about for passing they'd also hedged a little bit saying
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,968	| radiolab012915 |	If you throw forward pass through receiver doesn't catch it
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:18,784	| radiolab012915 |	You are penalized 15 yards which back in the day
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:22,624	| radiolab012915 |	With a monster amount so nobody threw the ball was too risky.
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:29,536	| radiolab012915 |	Story goes as soon as that ruled that passed pop when it goes back to his garage so he's a garage with a ball
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,864	| radiolab012915 |	Any starts experimenting and what would be the most
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:33,376	| radiolab012915 |	Efficient way
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,912	| radiolab012915 |	Apostasy
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:39,520	| radiolab012915 |	Why people have to understand that the footballs and those days are not the footballs we have today with the nice
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:44,896	| radiolab012915 |	Oblate spheroid or whatever they call it with a nice points and thinks he's a rugby ball
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:47,200	| radiolab012915 |	Citic imagine that deflated basketball
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,760	| radiolab012915 |	They're sticker in the middle they're not as well shaped
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| radiolab012915 |	They're really tough to get your hand on
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:58,720	| radiolab012915 |	Death row right and in 1906 in Albert exendine zorrel history weight
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,512	| radiolab012915 |	We talked about this in 1906
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:06,400	| radiolab012915 |	He says called all the players together he tells them
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,448	| radiolab012915 |	You will have to learn
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,008	| radiolab012915 |	Karla Bonoff
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,848	| radiolab012915 |	He says I think you can have to learn to spiral the ball
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,384	| radiolab012915 |	Cuz if you throw the ball in the spiral
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,432	| radiolab012915 |	10 times less Air drag
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:20,480	| radiolab012915 |	And if you throw it and over and plus it's easier to
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,272	| radiolab012915 |	They start
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:27,392	| radiolab012915 |	Experimenting with it a little bit in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,184	| radiolab012915 |	Which gets us to that game
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:36,096	| radiolab012915 |	November 23rd 1907 Carlisle plays the University of Chicago last game of the season where in Chicago
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:40,192	| radiolab012915 |	Chicago in the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation video
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:41,472	| radiolab012915 |	I don't think you can argue about
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:43,008	| radiolab012915 |	What color is good at this point though
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,288	| radiolab012915 |	Yeah but Chicago is like
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,592	| radiolab012915 |	Stagg field
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,176	| radiolab012915 |	And they're 27000 people in the stands
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:56,576	| radiolab012915 |	Well what happened was the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,112	| radiolab012915 |	Forward passing
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,904	| radiolab012915 |	I just
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:03,744	| radiolab012915 |	Knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,536	| radiolab012915 |	Until Carlisle's greatest receiver
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:11,936	| radiolab012915 |	Albert exendine our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minutes ball was snapped Chicago players would
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:15,520	| radiolab012915 |	Hit him and try to throw him down or knocking out of bounds
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:20,128	| radiolab012915 |	So Pop Warner said the exendine here's what we're going to do
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,664	| radiolab012915 |	Next time they hit you out of bounds
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:24,736	| radiolab012915 |	Sneak around the bench and get back on the field
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,040	| radiolab012915 |	By some accounts with X and I
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:29,856	| radiolab012915 |	On the next play
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:33,952	| radiolab012915 |	I would like to dine at expected ends up out of bounds

EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,840	| radiolab012915 |	He runs around the back of the bench
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| radiolab012915 |	Renter and spectators
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,936	| radiolab012915 |	Maybe around the van and comes back on the field
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,704	| radiolab012915 |	Reddit that moment
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,008	| radiolab012915 |	Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,128	| radiolab012915 |	Lex Luthor vicious spiral

EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:59,552	| radiolab012915 |	This is Sally's description of that moment from her book the real All-American
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:03,648	| radiolab012915 |	For a moment it was a frozen scene in a stage drama
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:09,536	| radiolab012915 |	The ball hung in the air a tantalizing possibility
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:10,560	| radiolab012915 |	Woody catch it
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:11,840	| radiolab012915 |	Or drop it
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:14,144	| radiolab012915 |	Defenders wheeldon stare-down field
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,192	| radiolab012915 |	Spectators watching from the stands
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:22,592	| radiolab012915 |	Brett had died in their Collective throats the spiraling ball seemed
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:23,616	| radiolab012915 |	To defy physics
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:25,152	| radiolab012915 |	What made it stay up
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,688	| radiolab012915 |	When will it come down
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:30,016	| radiolab012915 |	In that long moment 27000 spectators
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,088	| radiolab012915 |	Mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:38,464	| radiolab012915 |	May have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,792	| radiolab012915 |	I've noticed something they never had before
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:45,888	| radiolab012915 |	Butterball traveling through space traces of profoundly elegant path
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,448	| radiolab012915 |	They may have realized something else
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,752	| radiolab012915 |	That it was beautiful
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,200	| radiolab012915 |	The ball struck is human target
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:02,016	| radiolab012915 |	Action done caught the pass all alone
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:04,064	| radiolab012915 |	And trotted over the Chicago line
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:10,464	| radiolab012915 |	The stadium
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:16,864	| radiolab012915 |	Louder than sound in motion it was the game breaker the rest was just anticline
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:23,008	| radiolab012915 |	The final score was 18244 Carlisle
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:36,064	| radiolab012915 |	But very next year the ivy league pass is a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back on
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:41,184	| radiolab012915 |	That's what I wrote Come Together say that that description of the ball in the air
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| radiolab012915 |	Is
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,280	| radiolab012915 |	Timeless
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:48,864	| radiolab012915 |	Anyway that's exactly why football is still beautiful at a time
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:50,400	| radiolab012915 |	That's that's that's when
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:54,752	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes the sport that you watched
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:01,408	| radiolab012915 |	Oh wow this is this the field
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:03,712	| radiolab012915 |	This is the fee can we get out
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:16,000	| radiolab012915 |	After we spent an entire day looking at
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:16,768	| radiolab012915 |	Pictures of
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,816	| radiolab012915 |	You know Albert exendine in
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,120	| radiolab012915 |	Pride Pop Warner and doulas Lone Wolf and
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:28,032	| radiolab012915 |	Lino and all these Carlisle players Barbara and Carol took us to the field where they practice
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,568	| radiolab012915 |	Answer this is the Carlyle
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:32,384	| radiolab012915 |	Indian School football field
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,944	| radiolab012915 |	Covered in snow
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:40,320	| radiolab012915 |	10 degrees out here really really bright sun coming off this now
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,088	| radiolab012915 |	Insert empty
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,256	| radiolab012915 |	We just kind of walked around and
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,560	| radiolab012915 |	Try to imagine all the stuff we just seen in photos
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,888	| radiolab012915 |	He was a little bit like walking among ghosts
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:56,704	| radiolab012915 |	That's the sound of the flag blowing in the back
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:13,088	| radiolab012915 |	Understanding on that feel the end
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,368	| radiolab012915 |	Having two
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,416	| radiolab012915 |	Thought that I couldn't quite articulate
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:21,280	| radiolab012915 |	The later of Eric Anderson a professor from Haskell
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,560	| radiolab012915 |	Member of the Potawatomi Nation
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:24,352	| radiolab012915 |	Surprise finger on it
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,424	| radiolab012915 |	Essentially said that like there's a lot of room on a football field
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:31,776	| radiolab012915 |	Miss room for
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:36,384	| radiolab012915 |	Anger and war and violence is also room for pride
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:43,296	| radiolab012915 |	And a kind of coming together that's not a pratt coming together where one side gets erased
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,832	| radiolab012915 |	But it is a coming together
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,880	| radiolab012915 |	Yeah I mean there is a middle ground
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:49,184	| radiolab012915 |	Clearly it's more than a game
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,000	| radiolab012915 |	The stakes are higher than that
EDL	00:37:52,512	00:37:53,280	| radiolab012915 |	You know
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:57,632	| radiolab012915 |	Will we as Indian people be accepted
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,936	| radiolab012915 |	On our own terms

EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:20,160	| radiolab012915 |	It's clearly more than the game
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:43,712	| radiolab012915 |	A lot of people to think of this episode I we had original music made for us for that episode from Morgan okay

EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,080	| radiolab012915 |	Conversation these days
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:49,152	| radiolab012915 |	Everything about that we have talking with one of my favorite

EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:01,696	| radiolab012915 |	About
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:02,976	| radiolab012915 |	Football and it's
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,256	| radiolab012915 |	Inherent country
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,024	| radiolab012915 |	Prediction
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,560	| radiolab012915 |	We called for us this way
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:09,632	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle versus IV free flow versus
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,656	| radiolab012915 |	Traditional
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:13,216	| radiolab012915 |	Sort of thing but in a modern way
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:17,312	| radiolab012915 |	I want you to explain the statement
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,080	| radiolab012915 |	This is the thing I found most
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,176	| radiolab012915 |	You say basic
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,200	| radiolab012915 |	Bed bug bites
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:25,504	| radiolab012915 |	Training itself as a super conservative
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:27,552	| radiolab012915 |	Traditional manly sport but essentially
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:28,832	| radiolab012915 |	Operating is the opposite
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:31,904	| radiolab012915 |	It's really liberal wide-open anything goes going to
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| radiolab012915 |	Football became the most
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,744	| radiolab012915 |	Successful Enterprise in America
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:38,304	| radiolab012915 |	Do you have The Descent in it
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:39,584	| radiolab012915 |	Pretending to be one thing but actually another
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,608	| radiolab012915 |	What do you mean
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:47,008	| radiolab012915 |	Okay it's it's a unique thing in the sense that you look at a sport like soccer or baseball
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,056	| radiolab012915 |	There is a real
EDL	00:41:49,568	00:41:51,616	| radiolab012915 |	Since from the people who sort of
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:54,431	| radiolab012915 |	The institution of the sport to keep the sport the same
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:59,551	| radiolab012915 |	But they want the sport to sort of almost transcend time would be the same game now is it always
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:01,343	| radiolab012915 |	Soccer particularly
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:03,903	| radiolab012915 |	They hate any kind of attempt to change the rules in the
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:07,231	| radiolab012915 |	Football works in the exact opposite way
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:09,535	| radiolab012915 |	Football
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,815	| radiolab012915 |	Constantly evolving
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:14,143	| radiolab012915 |	Constantly adopting new ideas and new technologies
EDL	00:42:14,143	00:42:15,167	| radiolab012915 |	And is very willing
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:20,543	| radiolab012915 |	To alter the game in order to make it more free-flowing
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,335	| radiolab012915 |	Oreimo Progressive game
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:24,383	| radiolab012915 |	I mean football will add things like
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:28,991	| radiolab012915 |	Coaches can talk to the quarterback threw a radio in their helmet
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,783	| radiolab012915 |	It has been determined that the receiver
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:36,927	| radiolab012915 |	Now the idea of instant replay was added very early on compared to other
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,975	| radiolab012915 |	The game itself
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:42,047	| radiolab012915 |	From an offensive perspective
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,839	| radiolab012915 |	Is constantly being reinvented
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:51,519	| radiolab012915 |	Chuck says if you look at all the new formations that keep getting at and all the trick plays that are tried out every year it is
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:57,407	| radiolab012915 |	Play clear the football as a game it actually is the most liberal sport in terms of adopting ideas
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:57,919	| radiolab012915 |	But
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:42:59,455	| radiolab012915 |	V
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:02,783	| radiolab012915 |	The morality of the game in the center of
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,599	| radiolab012915 |	The thing that really draws people to
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:06,367	| radiolab012915 |	Love it
EDL	00:43:06,367	00:43:09,183	| radiolab012915 |	Is sort of almost most reactionary
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:09,951	| radiolab012915 |	Air quality
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:12,255	| radiolab012915 |	That it's still sort of comes down
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:17,375	| radiolab012915 |	To the strongest toughest win
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:20,703	| radiolab012915 |	This is why I feel like football has
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| radiolab012915 |	It is
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,239	| radiolab012915 |	Both song
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,543	| radiolab012915 |	Built for American
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:29,151	| radiolab012915 |	If the American way of thinking and also didn't so popular that it allows you
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:33,247	| radiolab012915 |	Sort of think about the game in a very liberal Progressive Way
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:35,295	| radiolab012915 |	Carlisle way but
EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:39,647	| radiolab012915 |	Spiritually it like your heart of it can still be this kind of old
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,695	| radiolab012915 |	Comfortable conservative mindset
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:44,511	| radiolab012915 |	Does old Ivy fundamentals of Power Inn
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,023	| radiolab012915 |	Might
EDL	00:43:45,791	00:43:51,423	| radiolab012915 |	Tradition of the beliefs if that's really what most people want most people want to think of themselves
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:52,191	| radiolab012915 |	As Progressive
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:58,079	| radiolab012915 |	But feel conservative argument is it is it is footballs unique ability to be both
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:59,871	| radiolab012915 |	The same time reactionary
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:04,735	| radiolab012915 |	And simultaneously wildly inventive so that you can think about it one way and feel about another
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:08,831	| radiolab012915 |	That is what makes football the most popular part
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,855	| radiolab012915 |	Ivar sporting call
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:10,879	| radiolab012915 |	Right now by
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,159	| radiolab012915 |	Factory
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:16,767	| radiolab012915 |	What he means is it the NFL's three times as popular as the next most pop
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:17,535	| radiolab012915 |	Motorsport
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,583	| radiolab012915 |	In the question we got to
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,607	| radiolab012915 |	Just cuz of the quest
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,631	| radiolab012915 |	You can't really avoid right now is
EDL	00:44:22,399	00:44:23,423	| radiolab012915 |	Is it going to stay that way
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,215	| radiolab012915 |	Which is weird
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:27,007	| radiolab012915 |	Era for the
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,287	| radiolab012915 |	Sport
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:31,103	| radiolab012915 |	Certainly mylifetime the strangest are they
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:34,175	| radiolab012915 |	Weird things are happening one is that
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:34,943	| radiolab012915 |	Injuries
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:35,711	| radiolab012915 |	Actor in
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| radiolab012915 |	There seems to be no limit
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:41,087	| radiolab012915 |	To the amount that we can discuss the problems with the game
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:41,855	| radiolab012915 |	Concussions in
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,415	| radiolab012915 |	In football if your coach how do you handle all this
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,463	| radiolab012915 |	This discussion about neurologist in head injuries doing
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,791	| radiolab012915 |	The idea that so many former NFL players
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:52,607	| radiolab012915 |	Are essentially you know decrepit and and
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,887	| radiolab012915 |	Why do I have problems
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:57,471	| radiolab012915 |	Study their brains after they die and they have the brains of people who
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:45:03,871	| radiolab012915 |	Should have been a hundred 80 years old and had Alzheimer's or whatever you know there was just a kid from Ohio State
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,639	| radiolab012915 |	Who shot himself
EDL	00:45:05,151	00:45:08,735	| radiolab012915 |	Has he sent a text to his mother saying
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,527	| radiolab012915 |	I am sorry if I'm an embarrassment
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:13,087	| radiolab012915 |	I basically text his mom and said it was like
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| radiolab012915 |	I think it's contractions and are making me do this these concussions have my head all
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,439	| radiolab012915 |	Effed up
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:24,351	| radiolab012915 |	At the same time it is an American Pastime
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:25,631	| radiolab012915 |	Game with the most watch
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,423	| radiolab012915 |	Event in American television
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:31,775	| radiolab012915 |	I think it's very plausible that the Superbowl this year will be the most
EDL	00:45:31,775	00:45:34,079	| radiolab012915 |	Watched sporting event of all time
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,103	| radiolab012915 |	In America
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:38,175	| radiolab012915 |	And this is why you feel a small
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,967	| radiolab012915 |	Cold wind in the air like
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:46,367	| radiolab012915 |	I feel absolutely
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:47,903	| radiolab012915 |	Usually never been serious.
EDL	00:45:47,903	00:45:48,671	| radiolab012915 |	Discussion
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:51,487	| radiolab012915 |	About should we as a culture be playing football since
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,303	| radiolab012915 |	Since Roosevelt 1905
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,351	| radiolab012915 |	No one seems to be
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,887	| radiolab012915 |	Stopping themselves
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:45:59,423	| radiolab012915 |	From watching these games
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:01,727	| radiolab012915 |	So it's almost like there are these two silos
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:08,383	| radiolab012915 |	Two separate streams in our Collective unconscious that exist simultaneously and I both like shooting Skyward
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:12,223	| radiolab012915 |	Okay so we got to be honest like when Chuck was talking
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:15,551	| radiolab012915 |	About the whole idea of Silo shooting Skyrim
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:20,159	| radiolab012915 |	Cool idea but we weren't really sure what that meant
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:22,719	| radiolab012915 |	Exactly
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:28,863	| radiolab012915 |	And so much that is until our producers are in Wheeler Mets
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,167	| radiolab012915 |	Emily Bartell
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:31,935	| radiolab012915 |	You could add something like
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,727	| radiolab012915 |	She want
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:37,567	| radiolab012915 |	I'm on a Bartell I'm a Libra enjoy long walks on the beach
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:45,503	| radiolab012915 |	So money is a partner in a media production company she lives with her husband there for kids outside of Atlanta Georgia but actually
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| radiolab012915 |	Go to talk to her about her son Parker
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:48,319	| radiolab012915 |	Because money says
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:50,367	| radiolab012915 |	The very moment he was born
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,135	| radiolab012915 |	So what are you thinking
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,159	| radiolab012915 |	When Park
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:55,231	| radiolab012915 |	As soon as the doctor
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| radiolab012915 |	Saw his third thumb
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:07,263	| radiolab012915 |	We're going to the NFL baby yes and then Parker's 10001
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:08,031	| radiolab012915 |	Announce
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,079	| radiolab012915 |	He's the biggest thing he walked out the womb
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:13,407	| radiolab012915 |	I'm still going with 3rd Stop
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:24,671	| radiolab012915 |	Parker comes out and he's the biggest thing I've ever seen you know I've prepared for months and I've found
EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:29,791	| radiolab012915 |	Perfect outfit to take him home from the hospital and and this Joker's too big for it
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:33,119	| radiolab012915 |	So right then I'm like oh my God yes yes
EDL	00:47:33,631	00:47:40,031	| radiolab012915 |	He's a boy and he's going to play in the NFL to play in the NFL a lot of families pass down quilts
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:43,871	| radiolab012915 |	They pass down family businesses are family tradition
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,151	| radiolab012915 |	What's football
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:45,919	| radiolab012915 |	It was football
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,967	| radiolab012915 |	My dad played football
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:54,879	| radiolab012915 |	The Lions leading Rodger was Mel fire he was a running back for the Detroit Lions actually Rookie of the Year
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:56,159	| radiolab012915 |	Year 1967
EDL	00:47:56,159	00:47:56,927	| radiolab012915 |	His brother played
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,975	| radiolab012915 |	Miller Farm Jerome
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:05,119	| radiolab012915 |	My uncle her brother is Mel Farr Jr and Michael far both play football and Jerry levias who they
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:10,751	| radiolab012915 |	Jerry ball
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,287	| radiolab012915 |	I can't even
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| radiolab012915 |	If I
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:15,871	| radiolab012915 |	I said I was going to actually write them all down
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,663	| radiolab012915 |	But it's something like 33
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:21,759	| radiolab012915 |	Family members have played in the NFL
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:26,111	| radiolab012915 |	Coming from a sports family
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:28,415	| radiolab012915 |	We had to play a sport
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:34,047	| radiolab012915 |	So I can remember getting up in the mornings before school six 7 in the morning and having agility drills
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:38,911	| radiolab012915 |	We lived on the house like just at home in your backyard in the backyard
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:42,495	| radiolab012915 |	We lived on a hill and
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:47,103	| radiolab012915 |	I didn't have it as bad as my brothers because I play tennis I started playing tennis at 3
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,895	| radiolab012915 |	But
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:55,807	| radiolab012915 |	Like in the wintertime my dad would strap my brother to the sled and my dad was sit in the sled they would
EDL	00:48:55,807	00:48:59,135	| radiolab012915 |	I have to run up the hill with my dad in the sled
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:00,927	| radiolab012915 |	Tire drills everything
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,951	| radiolab012915 |	Do you have a sense of light
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,231	| radiolab012915 |	Why
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,047	| radiolab012915 |	I think for my dad
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:11,679	| radiolab012915 |	Sports opened up so many doors for him my dad's from Beaumont TX
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,983	| radiolab012915 |	He was in Texas at a very
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:15,519	| radiolab012915 |	You know during segregation
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:18,847	| radiolab012915 |	So Sports allowed him to get out
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:21,407	| radiolab012915 |	It allowed him to provide
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:22,431	| radiolab012915 |	An excellent
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,455	| radiolab012915 |	Lifestyle for
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:23,967	| radiolab012915 |	Prince family
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:27,295	| radiolab012915 |	And being drafted to the Detroit Lions
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:30,367	| radiolab012915 |	And being a football player in the Motown era
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:36,767	| radiolab012915 |	Weekends at my house consisted of
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:39,839	| radiolab012915 |	Marvin Gaye in

EDL	00:49:55,455	00:50:01,855	| radiolab012915 |	And when he stopped playing football
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:02,879	| radiolab012915 |	He opened up his first
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,903	| radiolab012915 |	Car dealership
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,927	| radiolab012915 |	Another

EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:13,887	| radiolab012915 |	Was actually the largest African-American owned business in the country I mean that's what football did for him
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:15,423	| radiolab012915 |	Football
EDL	00:50:15,423	00:50:16,447	| radiolab012915 |	Gave my dad
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:17,471	| radiolab012915 |	A life

EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:22,335	| radiolab012915 |	Haley Bennett
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:26,943	| radiolab012915 |	So you start looking for leagues like we moved to Georgia when Parker was to
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,271	| radiolab012915 |	And I found one that started at 4
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:33,087	| radiolab012915 |	Just two more years of like a countdown
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:34,623	| radiolab012915 |	Oh my gosh one more year
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,159	| radiolab012915 |	And
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:37,695	| radiolab012915 |	When Parker turned four
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:41,791	| radiolab012915 |	I mean I can sleep the night before I might cat
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,327	| radiolab012915 |	Tomorrow's the day
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:45,631	| radiolab012915 |	Docker has no idea what's going on

EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:53,055	| radiolab012915 |	Wood helmet
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:54,335	| radiolab012915 |	Helmet pads
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:55,871	| radiolab012915 |	Spring training
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:58,175	| radiolab012915 |	Parker heads
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:59,455	| radiolab012915 |	Spring training
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:02,015	| radiolab012915 |	He's going to the tires
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:03,295	| radiolab012915 |	Keys for
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:04,831	| radiolab012915 |	Okay
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:06,879	| radiolab012915 |	That we don't even have team colors yet
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:10,207	| radiolab012915 |	But I'm there and what I feel like the team color should be
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:12,255	| radiolab012915 |	I hope they're in Honolulu blue
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:14,559	| radiolab012915 |	Is silver cuz that's Detroit life colors
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:20,191	| radiolab012915 |	So this is just at the spring training then we get to the actual team practice
EDL	00:51:21,215	00:51:23,263	| radiolab012915 |	They immediately they named in the tank
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:31,199	| radiolab012915 |	He was just going through people there like
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:35,039	| radiolab012915 |	First practice I'm not thinking about the other parents and their little
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:36,831	| radiolab012915 |	Normal sized children
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:42,463	| radiolab012915 |	And the fact that bite you know after the first day of practice three kids quit because Parker hedges
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:45,535	| radiolab012915 |	Wow them over I'm like yes my son is obese
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:51,167	| radiolab012915 |	Football in where we live
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:52,447	| radiolab012915 |	Is huge
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:55,007	| radiolab012915 |	At four years old they were tailgating
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:57,823	| radiolab012915 |	No I'm serious
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:03,711	| radiolab012915 |	The coaches have matching outfits that headgear like are you kidding me you guys are talking on microphone
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:04,479	| radiolab012915 |	And I'm like
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:05,503	| radiolab012915 |	Wow this is
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:07,039	| radiolab012915 |	This is freaking serious
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,831	| radiolab012915 |	And the coaches are cursing like
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:12,159	| radiolab012915 |	You guys are playing like a bunch of
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:13,951	| radiolab012915 |	Oh my god wow they're for
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:15,231	| radiolab012915 |	Don't even know what that is
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:17,279	| radiolab012915 |	Wow it's that
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:18,047	| radiolab012915 |	Serious
EDL	00:52:18,047	00:52:19,071	| radiolab012915 |	Are you starting
EDL	00:52:19,839	00:52:20,351	| radiolab012915 |	To think
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:21,887	| radiolab012915 |	This is ridiculous
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:26,495	| radiolab012915 |	At any point or it's just they were
EDL	00:52:27,263	00:52:28,543	| radiolab012915 |	Money says she knew that
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:35,455	| radiolab012915 |	Game of thorn Parker's team would take the field go fight with the proudest
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:35,967	| radiolab012915 |	Moment as a pet
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:37,759	| radiolab012915 |	My sign
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:38,271	| radiolab012915 |	It's a personal foul
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:41,599	| radiolab012915 |	I know
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:42,623	| radiolab012915 |	It's terrible
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,671	| radiolab012915 |	I'm my son
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,463	| radiolab012915 |	Just tackles this guy
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:49,023	| radiolab012915 |	Imma coach you know you would always
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:50,047	| radiolab012915 |	Makes me dirty
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:55,679	| radiolab012915 |	So after you tackle them my son took his head and play Future
EDL	00:52:56,191	00:52:58,239	| radiolab012915 |	But I had to keep myself down
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:04,639	| radiolab012915 |	Cut the kid who's eating mom every day start
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:06,175	| radiolab012915 |	Is when I realize I'm like God
EDL	00:53:06,687	00:53:07,967	| radiolab012915 |	If my son was just
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:12,319	| radiolab012915 |	Attacked by a 65 lb 4 year old I probably be a bit upset
EDL	00:53:12,319	00:53:13,855	| radiolab012915 |	Well this is a progression
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:15,647	| radiolab012915 |	This is okay they got the matching outfits
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:18,975	| radiolab012915 |	Okay to eat dirt and then you go home and reflect
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:19,487	| radiolab012915 |	Holiday Inn
EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:21,279	| radiolab012915 |	Oh my gosh
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,303	| radiolab012915 |	Kids mom
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,583	| radiolab012915 |	But then
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:24,863	| radiolab012915 |	We get to the Super Bowl
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:26,399	| radiolab012915 |	So I'm fanatical
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:28,703	| radiolab012915 |	The superlative for 5 year olds
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:29,471	| radiolab012915 |	Super Bowl
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:31,263	| radiolab012915 |	My son has a trophy that's
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:32,287	| radiolab012915 |	It's probably
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:32,799	| radiolab012915 |	3 ft tall
EDL	00:53:33,311	00:53:37,407	| radiolab012915 |	The crazy part is that as all this is happening as Parker's taking the field with us
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:38,943	| radiolab012915 |	4 and 5 year old teammates
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:41,503	| radiolab012915 |	A family member had really really started showing
EDL	00:53:45,599	00:53:46,367	| radiolab012915 |	Signs of Life
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:49,183	| radiolab012915 |	Chronic traumatic

EDL	00:53:50,975	00:53:51,999	| radiolab012915 |	What comes from Lake

EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:57,119	| radiolab012915 |	Bouts of anger
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:57,887	| radiolab012915 |	In this case
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:58,655	| radiolab012915 |	It
EDL	00:53:58,655	00:53:59,423	| radiolab012915 |	Was
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:00,447	| radiolab012915 |	Depression it was

EDL	00:54:16,063	00:54:16,831	| radiolab012915 |	It was getting
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:17,343	| radiolab012915 |	Phone call
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:18,623	| radiolab012915 |	Like hey I need you

EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:27,071	| radiolab012915 |	And at that very time

EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:31,167	| radiolab012915 |	I wouldn't sign
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:33,727	| radiolab012915 |	What's going on there
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:35,007	| radiolab012915 |	Cuz that's what we do
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:37,823	| radiolab012915 |	It's almost like a split personality
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:40,383	| radiolab012915 |	Registering him
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:41,151	| radiolab012915 |	For football
EDL	00:54:41,663	00:54:43,455	| radiolab012915 |	Was just as natural

EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:39,167	| radiolab012915 |	If he decides to
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:39,679	| radiolab012915 |	To play the game
EDL	00:56:41,983	00:56:42,495	| radiolab012915 |	If not
EDL	00:56:44,287	00:56:44,799	| radiolab012915 |	Begrudgingly
EDL	00:56:45,567	00:56:46,079	| radiolab012915 |	But that's okay
EDL	00:56:47,615	00:56:49,919	| radiolab012915 |	I don't want to force him to play especially this

EDL	00:56:50,943	00:56:54,527	| radiolab012915 |	So I stand firm on both sides
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:55,039	| radiolab012915 |	The debate
EDL	00:56:56,319	00:56:59,903	| radiolab012915 |	I know that's what makes it ridiculous
EDL	00:57:00,415	00:57:01,183	| radiolab012915 |	Eyes
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:02,207	| radiolab012915 |	Stanford
EDL	00:57:02,975	00:57:05,023	| radiolab012915 |	That children should not play football
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:06,815	| radiolab012915 |	I also stand
EDL	00:57:06,815	00:57:07,327	| radiolab012915 |	Confirm that
EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:08,863	| radiolab012915 |	Children should play football
EDL	00:57:09,375	00:57:10,655	| radiolab012915 |	That it's a great
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:11,167	| radiolab012915 |	Sport
EDL	00:57:11,935	00:57:13,727	| radiolab012915 |	The current solution to this quandary
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:19,871	| radiolab012915 |	So now we're out there
EDL	00:57:19,871	00:57:20,895	| radiolab012915 |	Where am I

EDL	00:57:26,271	00:57:30,111	| radiolab012915 |	Show all the kickers came from soccer
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:33,183	| radiolab012915 |	There's no black kickers there's no black punters
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:33,695	| radiolab012915 |	Even the kicker
EDL	00:57:34,975	00:57:35,743	| radiolab012915 |	Every so often
EDL	00:57:35,743	00:57:36,511	| radiolab012915 |	But there is a stiff
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:37,791	| radiolab012915 |	Death penalty for that it was 50
EDL	00:57:40,863	00:57:43,423	| radiolab012915 |	About this point in the conversation

EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:28,383	| radiolab012915 |	No I'm not that into football like the rest of my family
EDL	00:59:29,407	00:59:31,711	| radiolab012915 |	I usually think about just having fun
EDL	00:59:31,711	00:59:32,223	| radiolab012915 |	And not winning
EDL	00:59:34,783	00:59:35,295	| radiolab012915 |	Where'd you get that

EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:47,839	| radiolab012915 |	It's trying to have fun
EDL	00:59:48,607	00:59:49,887	| radiolab012915 |	Not just to be rude to
EDL	00:59:51,423	00:59:56,031	| radiolab012915 |	When you win all you're going to do is like take a trophy and say you're better than them
EDL	00:59:56,031	00:59:56,543	| radiolab012915 |	It's not
EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:57,823	| radiolab012915 |	Fair to the other
EDL	00:59:58,591	00:59:59,359	| radiolab012915 |	Do you like other sports
EDL	01:00:03,199	01:00:04,735	| radiolab012915 |	I really want to do synchronized

EDL	01:00:11,903	01:00:12,927	| radiolab012915 |	Is that true
EDL	01:00:14,975	01:00:18,815	| radiolab012915 |	Mostly because when I saw something about it
EDL	01:00:18,815	01:00:19,839	| radiolab012915 |	Kind of cool like
EDL	01:00:21,631	01:00:25,215	| radiolab012915 |	People are doing a lot of cool swimming tricks so I kind of thought it was
EDL	01:00:26,751	01:00:27,519	| radiolab012915 |	Something for me
EDL	01:00:28,543	01:00:30,079	| radiolab012915 |	Just you playing me
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:36,991	| radiolab012915 |	Synchronized swimming you like you're like this hasn't come talk to me about football and I'm going to tell him that I
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:39,039	| radiolab012915 |	I want to do synchronized swimming
EDL	01:00:40,063	01:00:40,831	| radiolab012915 |	I know you like it
EDL	01:00:41,343	01:00:43,391	| radiolab012915 |	Oh yes I'm going to do.
EDL	01:00:43,391	01:00:43,903	| radiolab012915 |	He likes this
EDL	01:00:44,927	01:00:45,695	| radiolab012915 |	They said swimming
EDL	01:00:46,207	01:00:48,767	| radiolab012915 |	But I guess you don't have to worry about that I would be a team sport
EDL	01:00:49,279	01:00:49,791	| radiolab012915 |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:52,863	| radiolab012915 |	Why was kind of exhausting
EDL	01:00:56,191	01:00:57,471	| radiolab012915 |	We can stop
EDL	01:00:59,775	01:01:01,823	| radiolab012915 |	Big Smo name Parker Bartell for letting
EDL	01:01:01,823	01:01:08,223	| radiolab012915 |	Legs or invade their home in exhaust them on short notice and by the way when when I went back and I counted all the relatives that
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:10,271	| radiolab012915 |	I've been in the NFL it wasn't 33
EDL	01:01:10,783	01:01:11,551	| radiolab012915 |	Louis XIII

EDL	01:01:12,831	01:01:13,599	| radiolab012915 |	Any case
EDL	01:01:13,599	01:01:16,159	| radiolab012915 |	Here's a logical question that we felt like we should ask
EDL	01:01:16,159	01:01:16,927	| radiolab012915 |	Ask Ellie somewhere
EDL	01:01:17,439	01:01:18,463	| radiolab012915 |	In the show

EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:35,615	| radiolab012915 |	Funny when one of my friends become tank

EDL	01:01:47,135	01:01:53,279	| radiolab012915 |	In nek I started making some calls High School coaches hey can you hear me
EDL	01:01:53,791	01:02:00,191	| radiolab012915 |	Winning teams losing teams on the bigger picture I called this guy

EDL	01:02:05,055	01:02:08,383	| radiolab012915 |	I don't know what you want to name the places where I
EDL	01:02:11,455	01:02:15,807	| radiolab012915 |	Disename in freelance sports writer
EDL	01:02:15,807	01:02:18,623	| radiolab012915 |	She was an intern at the Wall Street Journal
EDL	01:02:18,623	01:02:19,391	| radiolab012915 |	Sports.
EDL	01:02:19,391	01:02:20,671	| radiolab012915 |	In my first week
EDL	01:02:20,671	01:02:24,255	| radiolab012915 |	A article was published on ESPN that
EDL	01:02:24,255	01:02:30,655	| radiolab012915 |	Suggested based on Philly Pop Warner youth football numbers
EDL	01:02:30,655	01:02:33,215	| radiolab012915 |	Person Pop Warner but he is a Youth Football League
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:38,335	| radiolab012915 |	Based on Philly Pop Warner youth football numbers Youth Football was declining
EDL	01:02:38,335	01:02:39,871	| radiolab012915 |	Felt pretty significantly
EDL	01:02:39,871	01:02:46,271	| radiolab012915 |	Do you remember what the what the drop was around 5% a year between 2000
EDL	01:02:46,271	01:02:50,111	| radiolab012915 |	Had in 2012 when people saw these numbers they were like oh my God
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:51,391	| radiolab012915 |	Why exactly
EDL	01:02:51,903	01:02:58,303	| radiolab012915 |	5% doesn't sound too bad well I mean if you assume that the 5% drop doesn't change that's what address by ever
EDL	01:02:58,303	01:03:01,631	| radiolab012915 |	Every year than in 15 years you're in the neighborhood of like
EDL	01:03:01,631	01:03:03,679	| radiolab012915 |	50% less kids playing ball
EDL	01:03:04,191	01:03:04,959	| radiolab012915 |	Wow
EDL	01:03:05,727	01:03:11,359	| radiolab012915 |	If this is true it's about the end of football
EDL	01:03:11,359	01:03:13,663	| radiolab012915 |	Pop Warner than they're not going to middle school
EDL	01:03:13,663	01:03:18,783	| radiolab012915 |	Football you're not going to high school football not going to college football so they're not going to the NFL
EDL	01:03:18,783	01:03:24,415	| radiolab012915 |	Needless to say everyone is like oh my God is this actually true or is there more to these numbers than meets the eye
EDL	01:03:24,415	01:03:27,743	| radiolab012915 |	The rain starts digging into them
EDL	01:03:27,743	01:03:28,511	| radiolab012915 |	To put them in
EDL	01:03:28,511	01:03:29,535	| radiolab012915 |	And he
EDL	01:03:30,559	01:03:34,143	| radiolab012915 |	Doesn't look just it pop warner numbers he looks at all the Youth Football League
EDL	01:03:34,911	01:03:37,471	| radiolab012915 |	And what I began to realize was that
EDL	01:03:37,983	01:03:40,543	| radiolab012915 |	Big drop wasn't as drastic
EDL	01:03:40,543	01:03:43,103	| radiolab012915 |	But if there was indeed a truck
EDL	01:03:43,103	01:03:45,151	| radiolab012915 |	Business because everyone was saying all right
EDL	01:03:45,663	01:03:47,455	| radiolab012915 |	Okay your relief will be short-lived
EDL	01:03:49,247	01:03:52,063	| radiolab012915 |	Because because there's a bigger story
EDL	01:03:52,063	01:03:57,183	| radiolab012915 |	Moon rhyme with the participation across all Youth Sports not just football
EDL	01:03:57,183	01:04:00,767	| radiolab012915 |	I came back with noted drops in all
EDL	01:04:02,047	01:04:04,095	| radiolab012915 |	The biggest youth sports
EDL	01:04:04,095	01:04:08,447	| radiolab012915 |	It's not just the footballs everything's decreasing or nothing was Rising except for lacrosse
EDL	01:04:09,215	01:04:09,727	| radiolab012915 |	Emperor haki
EDL	01:04:10,239	01:04:12,031	| radiolab012915 |	Edline
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:13,055	| radiolab012915 |	Kids are playing sports
EDL	01:04:14,079	01:04:16,639	| radiolab012915 |	Football gets all of the attention
EDL	01:04:16,639	01:04:23,039	| radiolab012915 |	Hope all gets all of the controversy you don't really hear about basketball and soccer or baseball so you know
EDL	01:04:23,039	01:04:26,623	| radiolab012915 |	You don't have any reason to think that those Sports aren't still as healthy as they've always been
EDL	01:04:27,135	01:04:27,903	| radiolab012915 |	But then
EDL	01:04:27,903	01:04:28,671	| radiolab012915 |	When you go and look
EDL	01:04:29,439	01:04:32,767	| radiolab012915 |	UCI drop that is comprable to the drop
EDL	01:04:33,279	01:04:36,607	| radiolab012915 |	And the sport that's got everybody's hair on fire and you just
EDL	01:04:37,375	01:04:40,191	| radiolab012915 |	Wonder why this has been going on for silently
EDL	01:04:40,191	01:04:42,239	| radiolab012915 |	Is this an extension of the whole concussion thing
EDL	01:04:42,239	01:04:48,639	| radiolab012915 |	Yes concussions were definitely part of the conversation but so were you know budget issues and kids
EDL	01:04:48,639	01:04:50,943	| radiolab012915 |	Specializing in sports and getting burnt out
EDL	01:04:50,943	01:04:55,807	| radiolab012915 |	Are basically everyone had two reasons and every school has their reasons but the guys I talk to
EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:57,343	| radiolab012915 |	And it'll
EDL	01:04:57,343	01:05:02,975	| radiolab012915 |	Kept coming back to land on this point that had nothing to do with safety
EDL	01:05:03,743	01:05:04,255	| radiolab012915 |	Today is
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:06,303	| radiolab012915 |	Kingdom like the score
EDL	01:05:06,815	01:05:08,095	| radiolab012915 |	He just hits restart
EDL	01:05:08,095	01:05:11,423	| radiolab012915 |	He just starts the game over cuz I can get on a video game
EDL	01:05:11,423	01:05:17,823	| radiolab012915 |	They can play they start losing their hit reset hit the button and play another game they just hit a button start
EDL	01:05:17,823	01:05:24,223	| radiolab012915 |	JT Curtis JJ Woodward and George Salas there in Louisiana California and Kansas and I heard this refer
EDL	01:05:24,223	01:05:29,343	| radiolab012915 |	Find not just from them but I heard this in Ohio I heard this in Michigan and by this point I was like
EDL	01:05:29,343	01:05:30,879	| radiolab012915 |	Jesus
EDL	01:05:31,391	01:05:33,695	| radiolab012915 |	It's funny cuz it's as if
EDL	01:05:34,207	01:05:38,047	| radiolab012915 |	All the coaches all across the nation are reading the same book
EDL	01:05:38,047	01:05:40,607	| radiolab012915 |	Or going to the same bar or something because
EDL	01:05:41,119	01:05:43,679	| radiolab012915 |	I'm literally everyone I talked to his brought this up
EDL	01:05:43,679	01:05:46,751	| radiolab012915 |	Is it just that everyone said it to each other so much that it's
EDL	01:05:47,263	01:05:51,615	| radiolab012915 |	I can tell you that's not it at all it's it's because we all deal with the problem
EDL	01:05:51,615	01:05:56,991	| radiolab012915 |	So all this cuz I talked to her like you can't go hit reset you can't hit reset you can't hit reset like
EDL	01:05:56,991	01:05:58,783	| radiolab012915 |	These kids are used to like
EDL	01:05:58,783	01:06:05,183	| radiolab012915 |	It's like if I sound so old they're basically saying that what they find is they feel like there's some some
EDL	01:06:05,183	01:06:06,207	| radiolab012915 |	Commitment issues
EDL	01:06:06,207	01:06:09,023	| radiolab012915 |	I've only play if I win I only want to win
EDL	01:06:09,023	01:06:13,631	| radiolab012915 |	Yeah so the interesting thing was is the coaches I talked with the PowerHouse schools
EDL	01:06:13,631	01:06:16,447	| radiolab012915 |	We're not actually having trouble getting kids
EDL	01:06:16,447	01:06:16,959	| radiolab012915 |	Because we win
EDL	01:06:17,983	01:06:19,775	| radiolab012915 |	But the other schools in the
EDL	01:06:19,775	01:06:20,543	| radiolab012915 |	The conference
EDL	01:06:20,543	01:06:22,591	| radiolab012915 |	Stay know that coaches athletic director
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:24,639	| radiolab012915 |	She's not talk to some schools that had for fitting
EDL	01:06:25,407	01:06:31,807	| radiolab012915 |	Ends up forfeiting games they said like you just don't get the kids that will work their asses off and ride the bench
EDL	01:06:31,807	01:06:34,111	| radiolab012915 |	Everybody wants to win it just somehow it seems like that
EDL	01:06:34,111	01:06:40,511	| radiolab012915 |	Expect to win or isn't worth the effort or it's just that there are so many options like why would you choose the losing apps
EDL	01:06:40,511	01:06:42,559	| radiolab012915 |	Used to go home
EDL	01:06:42,559	01:06:43,327	| radiolab012915 |	After school
EDL	01:06:43,839	01:06:45,375	| radiolab012915 |	I turn the TV on
EDL	01:06:45,375	01:06:46,655	| radiolab012915 |	Nursery channels
EDL	01:06:46,655	01:06:47,423	| radiolab012915 |	So I had
EDL	01:06:47,423	01:06:49,471	| radiolab012915 |	And they usually wishon soap operas
EDL	01:06:49,471	01:06:55,615	| radiolab012915 |	So there was really no reason I will add no reason to stay home now you go home there's a hundred
EDL	01:06:55,615	01:06:58,687	| radiolab012915 |	50 stations you can find something you want to watch
EDL	01:06:58,687	01:06:59,711	| radiolab012915 |	Or you get out
EDL	01:07:00,479	01:07:00,991	| radiolab012915 |	Again
EDL	01:07:02,015	01:07:06,879	| radiolab012915 |	Alright so whether it you think it's video games or parenting or
EDL	01:07:07,391	01:07:08,159	| radiolab012915 |	Sheriff
EDL	01:07:08,159	01:07:09,439	| radiolab012915 |	Cushing's or whatever
EDL	01:07:09,439	01:07:10,463	| radiolab012915 |	Reason you want to choose
EDL	01:07:10,975	01:07:12,767	| radiolab012915 |	23 largest good happens
EDL	01:07:12,767	01:07:14,559	| radiolab012915 |	These conversations about sports like
EDL	01:07:14,559	01:07:19,679	| radiolab012915 |	Football is it it doesn't actually seem to be about football it's like some kind of negotiation between the generation
EDL	01:07:20,447	01:07:21,215	| radiolab012915 |	Cuz like
EDL	01:07:21,215	01:07:22,495	| radiolab012915 |	Back in the 1870s
EDL	01:07:22,495	01:07:23,263	| radiolab012915 |	The harbor kids
EDL	01:07:23,775	01:07:30,175	| radiolab012915 |	They were using footballs away to say back to the previous generation like look how tough we are looking manly we are
EDL	01:07:30,175	01:07:31,455	| radiolab012915 |	Maybe this generation
EDL	01:07:32,479	01:07:36,575	| radiolab012915 |	Is turning away from sports like football also to say something back to
EDL	01:07:36,575	01:07:37,343	| radiolab012915 |	The previous generation
EDL	01:07:38,623	01:07:40,159	| radiolab012915 |	Something about the world they want to live in
EDL	01:07:42,207	01:07:43,231	| radiolab012915 |	Sport do
EDL	01:07:44,511	01:07:45,535	| radiolab012915 |	Suggest thing
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:46,559	| radiolab012915 |	About
EDL	01:07:47,071	01:07:49,375	| radiolab012915 |	Society and about reality
EDL	01:07:49,887	01:07:52,447	| radiolab012915 |	That we are slowly trying
EDL	01:07:52,447	01:07:53,215	| radiolab012915 |	To move
EDL	01:07:53,727	01:07:54,751	| radiolab012915 |	Remove from exhaust
EDL	01:07:55,263	01:07:58,335	| radiolab012915 |	I'm the idea that somehow
EDL	01:07:58,335	01:08:00,383	| radiolab012915 |	Physicality matters more
EDL	01:08:00,383	01:08:01,151	| radiolab012915 |	In the mine
EDL	01:08:01,151	01:08:02,687	| radiolab012915 |	And that people really aren't equal
EDL	01:08:03,199	01:08:06,783	| radiolab012915 |	And that if you yell at someone and challenge their manhood off
EDL	01:08:06,783	01:08:09,087	| radiolab012915 |	I mean Albert masculinity of any kind
EDL	01:08:09,087	01:08:11,903	| radiolab012915 |	It's not something that were in the mood to celebrate these days
EDL	01:08:12,415	01:08:13,695	| radiolab012915 |	So it could be
EDL	01:08:13,695	01:08:18,559	| radiolab012915 |	You believe ridership last minute it could be that some kids are choosing away from sports like football because
EDL	01:08:19,583	01:08:20,351	| radiolab012915 |	To play football
EDL	01:08:21,119	01:08:24,191	| radiolab012915 |	It means it on some level you have to
EDL	01:08:24,191	01:08:24,959	| radiolab012915 |	Port
EDL	01:08:24,959	01:08:27,519	| radiolab012915 |	At least entertaining ideas that you don't like
EDL	01:08:28,031	01:08:28,543	| radiolab012915 |	No
EDL	01:08:29,055	01:08:30,335	| radiolab012915 |	At least you don't admit that you like
EDL	01:08:31,615	01:08:32,383	| radiolab012915 |	Mitsubishi bits
EDL	01:08:32,383	01:08:34,687	| radiolab012915 |	You Think You're Something unconscious about me
EDL	01:08:34,687	01:08:36,223	| radiolab012915 |	That is drawn to
EDL	01:08:38,015	01:08:41,599	| radiolab012915 |	The problems in the game that are based around what it really is
EDL	01:08:42,111	01:08:43,391	| radiolab012915 |	Which is a two dudes
EDL	01:08:43,391	01:08:44,671	| radiolab012915 |	Slamming into yes
EDL	01:08:44,671	01:08:50,815	| radiolab012915 |	Because you know I mean okay if this is like I'm doing can I get something pop psychology on myself
EDL	01:08:54,143	01:08:54,911	| radiolab012915 |	But I
EDL	01:08:55,423	01:08:57,215	| radiolab012915 |	I sometimes wonder if
EDL	01:08:57,983	01:08:58,495	| radiolab012915 |	If
EDL	01:09:00,031	01:09:01,567	| radiolab012915 |	Soho part of me
EDL	01:09:02,591	01:09:03,615	| radiolab012915 |	Mrs.
EDL	01:09:04,895	01:09:05,407	| radiolab012915 |	That
EDL	01:09:05,919	01:09:06,687	| radiolab012915 |	From my life
EDL	01:09:07,455	01:09:08,991	| radiolab012915 |	That you know that that my life
EDL	01:09:10,015	01:09:11,295	| radiolab012915 |	Build around sitting in a
EDL	01:09:12,063	01:09:12,831	| radiolab012915 |	Computer
EDL	01:09:12,831	01:09:14,623	| radiolab012915 |	And avoiding
EDL	01:09:14,623	01:09:15,135	| radiolab012915 |	Conflict
EDL	01:09:15,647	01:09:17,951	| radiolab012915 |	And basically thinking about things and
EDL	01:09:17,951	01:09:24,095	| radiolab012915 |	Going on the radio and talking about what they might mean you know any sort of like where they metaphors for what is this culture what is it
EDL	01:09:24,095	01:09:25,631	| radiolab012915 |	And that that
EDL	01:09:25,631	01:09:27,679	| radiolab012915 |	That perhaps football
EDL	01:09:27,679	01:09:28,703	| radiolab012915 |	Allows me to
EDL	01:09:28,703	01:09:29,471	| radiolab012915 |	The sword of
EDL	01:09:29,471	01:09:31,775	| radiolab012915 |	You know I'm not playing it I'm just watching it
EDL	01:09:31,775	01:09:35,359	| radiolab012915 |	But somehow by watching it allows me to tap into something
EDL	01:09:35,359	01:09:39,967	| radiolab012915 |	That is no longer part of my life because my mind has trained me not to want it
EDL	01:09:40,479	01:09:42,527	| radiolab012915 |	My mind knows not to
EDL	01:09:43,039	01:09:44,575	| radiolab012915 |	Look for conflict
EDL	01:09:45,343	01:09:46,111	| radiolab012915 |	Now
EDL	01:09:47,391	01:09:48,159	| radiolab012915 |	Do I
EDL	01:09:48,159	01:09:48,927	| radiolab012915 |	Spectrum
EDL	01:09:49,439	01:09:50,719	| radiolab012915 |	Socialized
EDL	01:09:50,719	01:09:53,023	| radiolab012915 |	To believe that would be a
EDL	01:09:53,023	01:09:54,303	| radiolab012915 |	Positive exciting thing
EDL	01:09:54,303	01:09:55,327	| radiolab012915 |	Absolutely
EDL	01:09:55,327	01:10:00,191	| radiolab012915 |	I mean I you know I talked about sports with my father
EDL	01:10:00,191	01:10:02,495	| radiolab012915 |	More than we talked about
EDL	01:10:02,495	01:10:04,543	| radiolab012915 |	Every other thing we ever talked
EDL	01:10:05,055	01:10:05,823	| radiolab012915 |	Regulation
EDL	01:10:06,591	01:10:09,407	| radiolab012915 |	How you passed away am I love him in a great relationship
EDL	01:10:09,407	01:10:10,943	| radiolab012915 |	But we definitely
EDL	01:10:10,943	01:10:12,479	| radiolab012915 |	Spent more time
EDL	01:10:12,479	01:10:13,503	| radiolab012915 |	Discussing Sports
EDL	01:10:13,503	01:10:16,575	| radiolab012915 |	But I would say every other thing that we discussed even though you would always say
EDL	01:10:16,575	01:10:18,111	| radiolab012915 |	It's like the most important thing he'd like
EDL	01:10:19,135	01:10:24,767	| radiolab012915 |	From whatever you know and he would be like so how was school today and I would tell him what school was briefly and he would be like
EDL	01:10:25,279	01:10:29,375	| radiolab012915 |	We know academics in the most important thing about football practice for an hour
EDL	01:10:34,239	01:10:35,519	| radiolab012915 |	I realize that
EDL	01:10:35,519	01:10:41,151	| radiolab012915 |	My relationship is Football goes back if you know my I have two older brothers man we spend so much time
EDL	01:10:41,151	01:10:42,943	| radiolab012915 |	Throwing the football around
EDL	01:10:42,943	01:10:46,271	| radiolab012915 |	And and and my brother one of my brothers were
EDL	01:10:46,271	01:10:48,575	| radiolab012915 |	Very good football players in like one playlist
EDL	01:10:49,087	01:10:50,111	| radiolab012915 |	College live on
EDL	01:10:50,879	01:10:57,279	| radiolab012915 |	First grader I was so proud of that you know I would tell you there's all of these things that I'm sure
EDL	01:10:57,279	01:11:00,607	| radiolab012915 |	Are creating obstacles for me seeing this clearly
EDL	01:11:00,607	01:11:04,191	| radiolab012915 |	And maybe the kind of person who sort of like this guy is crazy
EDL	01:11:04,191	01:11:10,591	| radiolab012915 |	He's not seeing the obvious thing that he is actually saying that we need to somehow find a moral justification for
EDL	01:11:10,591	01:11:13,407	| radiolab012915 |	For a game that's probably killing dudes for money
EDL	01:11:14,687	01:11:20,063	| radiolab012915 |	I don't know it's not my fault that's how I feel like kicking around a man I'm sorry
EDL	01:11:23,391	01:11:25,439	| radiolab012915 |	There you go
EDL	01:11:27,231	01:11:28,767	| radiolab012915 |	You have two new messages
