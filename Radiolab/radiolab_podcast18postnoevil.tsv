EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Be visible
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And be peaceful

EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Would get taken down
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading pornographic content
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And people work
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Really getting their backs up over this
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They wanted Facebook to stop taking their photos
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To say that will nudity is not allowed

EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And what we can't save Facebook

EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Okay I'll I'm going to sleep now. We're going to hear 3 ish
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Okay okay give me to send the issue but that's go ahead with let's start back
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	On that morning in mm
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The morning that you could argue
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Started it all
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cuz in the building right behind those protecting mothers
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There was a group of Facebook employees
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sitting in a conference room
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Trying to figure out what to do
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cool so if I
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So I'm just going to
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	One of them was actually in that room at that moment
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And now neither of these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Extensively house that will that take work for you
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just so we have it
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	With these two different former Facebook employees
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	All right ready
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At the time when I join them there was a
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Small group 12 of us mostly recent College grads Integrity team again
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Keep in mind this was in the early 2000s
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Change this week in the internet hierarchy deep dark
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Myspace.com
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is now the most visited web
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Us
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook head somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million users
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We were smaller than Myspace
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The vast majority of them College
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so in those early days those 12 people they would they would sit around in a
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Conference like room with a big long table
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Each of them in front of their own computer and things would come up onto their screen flagged to Facebook
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I like meaning like I a user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You think violates
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The community standards this is Kate klonick she's a professor of law at St John's in in she's been a lot of time studying the
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This very thing
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in she says in those early days what would happen is
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:36,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A user would flag a piece of content and then
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Fat content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It would just pop up on their screen
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Most of what you were saying was either naked people
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Blown off heads org
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Things that there is no clear reason why someone had reported cuz it was like a
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Photo of a golden retriever
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People are just annoying
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And every time something popped up on the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Whether to leave that thing up or take it down
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And at the time if you didn't know what to do you would turn your pod leader who was you know
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Somebody who'd been around nine months longer than you and asks
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What do I do with this
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they would either have
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Seen it before and explain it to you or you both with knowing you
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Google something
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It really was just kind of an ad hoc approach standard or any common standard
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They had a set of community standards but the thing at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was not very specific guidelines were really one page long there one page long
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And basically all this page said was
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Nudity is bad
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So is Hitler and if it makes you feel bad take it down
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Pop up on the screen in front of them
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They be like
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Until
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Rise up fight for the rights to have breastfeeding
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Anyway
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Now a dozen or so people in front of their office
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is on a Saturday
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But I thought
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know hey we have an opportunity here with you know over 10000 members in our group
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:24,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	According to Stephanie mirror those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Who had organized
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Clean up
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So to coincide with the live protest I just typed up a little blurb encouraging hour
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Members that were in the group
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To do a virtual nursing
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A virtual nurse
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Right
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What we did
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,231	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They posted a message asking their members
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Two for one day
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Change their profile Avatar
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To an image of breastfeeding and then change their status
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To the title of our group pay Facebook breastfeeding is not obscene and it caught on
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The social networking website is under Fire for its policy on photos of women breastfeeding their children
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:11,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Hundreds of interviews for print
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Chicago Tribune Miami Herald Time Magazine we are X Washington Post
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What is an interesting phenomenon
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was a media storm
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Eventually
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Perhaps
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As a result of our group in our efforts
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Was
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Forced to get much more specific
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	About
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Their rules
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Soap for example by then nudity was already not allowed on
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But they had no definition for nudity
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They just said no nudity and so decide Integrity team that does 12 people at the time they realize they had to start
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Spelling out exactly what they meant
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Precisely
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	All of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Define nudity so I mean yeah the first cut out it was
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Visible male and female genitalia
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then visible female breasts
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then the question is
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well okay how much of it
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's me showing before it's nude
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and areola
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The nap nudity
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And it would have to be taken down
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Theoretically at least would appease these protests
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because you know now when a picture would pop up
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Of a mother breastfeeding
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As long as the child was blocking the view of the nipple in the area let they they could say cool no problem
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:35,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then you start getting pictures that are women with just their babies on their chest
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	With their breasts
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bear
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like for example maybe baby was sleeping on the chest of a bare-breasted woman and not actively breastfeeding
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like is this actually breastfeed
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	No it's actually not breasts
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Spitting the woman is just holding the baby and she has her top off
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	No but she was clearly just breastfeeding the baby
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well like I would say
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But I would say it's sort of like kicking a soccer ball
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like a photo of someone who has just kicked a soccer ball you can tell the ball is in the air but there is no contact between the foot
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the ball in that moment potentially so although it is a photo of someone kicking a soccer ball they are not in fact
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kicking the soccer ball in that phone became the procedure or the
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Get the protocol of the approach for all these things
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We have the basic
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Shirley on what we can see in the image
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I didn't like that to stay up under the rules because it could be
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To easily exploited for other types of content like nudity or pornography
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We got to the only way you could have ejected Lee say that the baby in the mother were engaged in breastfeeding is if the baby's lips were touch
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Touching a woman's nipple
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So they included but you can call like an attachment
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Closs
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But as soon as they got that rule in place
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like you would see you know a 25 year old woman and a teenage looking boy right and like
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What the hell is going on there oh yeah it's gets really weird if you like start entering into like
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Child and I wasn't even going to bring that up cuz it's kind of gross
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's like breastfeeding p*** other sites like the currently
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so this time they realize they needed to have a nudity rule that allowed for breastfeeding
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But also had some kind of an age
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy then we believe that it's inappropriate
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But then pictures would start popping up on your screen and they'd be like wait
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is that an infant
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like where's the line between infant and toddler and so the thing that we landed on was if it look like the child could walk on his
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cizeron
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then to all
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Big enough to walk
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To bigger breast
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah and
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like 18 months or two years
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Mets
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There were a lot of photos still being taken down
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Within
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know days
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sweep it
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Continuing to hear reports from
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People that
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Their photographs were still being targeted
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook did offer a state
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know that's where we're going to draw the line
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And keep in mind through this whole episode
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is this perhaps the next big
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook.
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cam the company was growing really really fast
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they're just got to be a lot more content
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	500 people
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	100000 sub who knows where we're going more people are joining Facebook everyday
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	60 million user so far 200 million by the end of the year and now War people on Facebook
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not just within the United States but also it was growing rapidly
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You were getting in Turkey
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook getting big throughout the EU
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Content coming in from all these different places in all different languages
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How are we going to keep everybody on the same page
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Once I saw that this was the operational method for dealing with this
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Creating this like nesting
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:15,775	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Set of exceptions and rules and he's clear things that had to be there or had to not be there in order to keep content up or take it down
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Datsun became
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Their procedure
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so dis
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	60 people in 900
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they set out to create rules and definitions
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Forbes
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Everything
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Can we go through some sort of the ridiculous examples with left over here okay
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sogor
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Gore mean violence, Gore
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The gold standard was
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Headline we don't allow graphic violence and Gore
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The shorthand definition that used was no insides on the outside
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	No guts no blood
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Going out of something what was a separate issue there was an excessive blood
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Rule had to come up with rules about bodily fluids semen for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What Does the clinical setting mean and
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At one of my favorite examples is like
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How do you define art because as these people are moderating they would see images of naked
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People that were paintings or sculptures
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	,
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so what they decided to do is say art with nakedness can stay up like it stays up if it is made out of
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Made out of metal
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Made out of
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Don't really yeah because how else
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Do you define art you have to just be like
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is this what you can see with your eyeballs
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so from then on is they run into problems those rules just constantly get updated constantemente
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah constant Amendment
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	New problem
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	New rule
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Another new problem
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Updated rule
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In fact at this point that there are mending these rules up to
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	20 times a month
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Really I take for example those rules about breastfeeding
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In 2013 they removed
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The attachment
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Claws
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Said the baby no longer needed to have its mouth
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Physically touching the nipple of the woman
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in fact
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	1
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Nipple
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And or areola could be visible in the photo
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Only one
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then 2014 they make it so that
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Both nipples or both areola may be present in the photo
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is what happens in American war all the time just everything
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,871	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I know it sounds a lot
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like common law
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So common law is this system dating back to early England where individual judges would make rulings which would sort of be a
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judge
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Soak the body of law was sort of constantly flashed out in face of new facts
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Literally every time this team is Facebook which would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Apply
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Something that they that they weren't prepared for that is that the rule hadn't
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	For example sometime around 2011
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:10,367	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This content moderator is is going through a queue of things
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Reject
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Escalade
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Accept and she comes up on this image
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Oh my God
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The photo itself was a teenage girl
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	African by dressing skin
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Breastfeeding a goat's of baby goats
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the moderator throws her hands up and says what the f*** is this
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And we googled breastfeeding goats and found
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That this was a thing
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It turns out it's a survival pract
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	According to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In a drought
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Unknown way to help your herd get through the drought is too if you have if you have a woman who's like that
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To have her nurse
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The kid the baby goat along with her
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Human kit
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There's nothing sexual about it
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Good farming business couldn't and theoretically
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If we go
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Point-by-point through this list
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's an infant
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It is sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there is no physical contact between the mouth and the nipple
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Obviously
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Breastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Consuming that moment
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What they decide to do is
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Remove the photo
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And there was an amendment and a strict under the rule stating animals are not babies
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:32,288	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We had that so in any future cases people would know what to do
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Foot but they removed they did they discover was culturally appropriate and a thing that people do when they decide to remove the
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The photo yet
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That are aged individuals are a determined wheeler why why didn't we make an exception because
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cuz because when a problem grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This was not one of those cases
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Juice wasn't worth the squeeze
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And like if they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:03,264	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay this is a utilitarian document
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's not about being right 100% of the time
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,360	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's about it
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Being able to execute effect
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be 100% just or Fair
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:21,440	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're just trying to make something that works
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:30,656	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When you step back and look at what Facebook has become
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,192	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like from 2008
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To now is it 10 years
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Xiamen I've just arrived at Accenture Tower
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kerri mennella idea of a single set of rules that work
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:50,112	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That can be applied fairly that's just a crazy crazy concept
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	1516 because they gone from something like 70 million users to 2.2 billion
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cartoon pig Camp I would say it's about 30
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They've gone from 12-volt sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	2 somewhere around
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	16000 people
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So there's a floor in this building where the Facebook supposedly outsources content moderators
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's out around 2010 they decided to start Outsourcing
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Some of this work
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Places like vanilla
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Where you just heard reporter Aurora on the drawl
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As well as
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Dublin where we sent reporter Garrett
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Stack
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Scene where they get their stitches Facebook
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Everybody's beavering away
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And we sent them there to try to talk to some of these people
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Tube for letting sit at a computer and collectively click-through around a million flag bits of content the pop up
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Another screen everyday
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Wow what was just curious like what's what's that like well
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Citizen question
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Found out pretty quickly
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	None of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So there's a lot of running away from me happening
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I mean like
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	He just came out of there
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I know you're lying in fact most people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's up is there something
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Wrong about being inside like an NDA that they signed so when I finally did find someone willing
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you know
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Or do you not want to be named
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's totally fine
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Explain that he and all the other moderators like and were forced to sign these non-disclosure
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Stating they weren't allowed to
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I admit
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,616	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But they work for Facebook
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,688	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're not allowed to talk about the work they do
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Ernie from talking about
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:55,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Why
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Several reasons one is that
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Up until recently Facebook wanted to
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Keep secret what these rules were so that it couldn't be gamed
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At the same time at
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Create
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Monitor graphic images
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,776	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just given the nature of the job
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,408	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's going to have on you
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I know you got to do this guy I talked to him he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the day
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Duration of it about a year

EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well if I can ask what kind of things did you see
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's true I think it's too x-rated unspeakable
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The magic button to

EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Having sex with an 8 year old boy
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And it's not just one
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When did you did this like keep you up at night and you did this
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:51,520	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Wake me up at 9 about these videos photos when he was trying to relax
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:56,384	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	He had to start avoiding things
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	SES

EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,648	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In an automated fashion
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Particularly with content like Gore or terrorist propaganda
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The game better than make that they

EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,344	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We sent our pair of interns

EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kind of.
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We sent them there to check out
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Someone else who found a fault line
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In Facebook

EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I guess so
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Mad I feel like my person to the city I was such a
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Care for you brat
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know I was young and I had these older friends which I thought was like very cool
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then you just realize that they're alcoholics
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Got dark curly hair with razor

EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know I was kind of the only thing that ever clicked with me and especially political comedy you know I used to watch the day
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:22,976	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Daily Show every day back in 2016 she started this
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Political running bit
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,304	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But I think can be called sort of
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,608	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Absurdist feminist,
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I know a lot of people
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I think that I'm like an angry
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:31,936	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Feminist
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which is weird
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because I am training and
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,664	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the wood
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:48,832	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At first I just had this running bit online
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:52,160	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	On Facebook and Twitter jokes
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know like we have all the Buffalo Wild Wings around it
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You know things like that eventually took this bit on stage
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,584	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Even wrote
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Shadowsocks
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	No no not my dad
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So about a year into this running bit
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Marshall was bored at work one day
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And logs on the face
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But instead of seeing her normal Newsfeed there is this message
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's that pops up
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:27,744	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It says you posted something.
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,792	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Discriminated along the lines of race
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Gender
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Or ethnicity group and so we removed that
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so I'm like
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What could I buy
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Possibly a Post-It
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I really I thought was like a glitch but
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then she clicked continue and their highlighted was the violating po
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was a photo of
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:52,576	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What is the picture can you describe it to me as what can only be described as a
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:58,976	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The chair of cute little seven-year-old with big curly hair and she's wearing this blue floral dress her teeth are all
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Messed up into the photo Marcia had edited in a speech bubble that just says
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kill all men
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As it's fine it's funny you know it's just me whatever
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I thought was ridiculous because she searched through her Library photos and
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Found that killallmen image
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I post it again
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:22,784	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Immediately after like yeah and it got removed
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:25,088	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Again and this time they were consequence
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I got banned for three days after that then after several other
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Shoot forward this is months later a friend of hers had posted an article and underneath it in the comment section they were guys
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Guys posting just really nasty
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So I commented underneath those comments
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Men are scum
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,544	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which was
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Very
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How long did you get banned for this time
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	30 days
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Wow
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah I was
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Dumbfounded
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So there's a rule somewhere
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If I type
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Men are scum
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,416	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You take it down
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:01,184	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yes
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,208	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I'm like what could it be
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Inside Marshall called on her quote militia of win
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Exactly
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To find out like is this just me
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Female comedians who are sort of like mad on my behalf
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Started experimenting posting men are scum to see how quickly it would get remove and if it would be
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Remove every time and it was
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They started trying other way
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Fluff yeah
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Did find out where the line was
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:32,160	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	My friend put Menard duska that got removed
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,440	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Men are the worst
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Remove the band this one girl put men are septic fluid
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,560	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Band
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But we're only at the middle of the Saga
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It doesn't end there
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because now she's really like
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like what the hell is going on
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is it sexism so I just start doing the most
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bare minimum amount of investigating
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:59,040	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cheap Googling around trying to figure out what these policies are in pretty quick she comes across this leak
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook.com
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So this is when I lose my mind
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is when Mark Zuckerberg becomes my
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sworn nemesis
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	For the rest of my life
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:12,096	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because what you found with a document Facebook used to train their modern
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Inside of it in section detailing who Facebook protected from hate speech
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There was a multiple choice question that said
EDL	00:34:21,056	00:34:21,824	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Who do we protect
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,384	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	White men or black children
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,944	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the correct answer was
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	White men
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not black
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not even kidding
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	White man protecting black
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Children are not
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,392	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's not it
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,928	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Look it's racist
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,976	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Something's going on here
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There is absolutely some sort of unaddressed
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,864	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bias or systemic issue
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:45,888	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	@facebook
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Hello
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How are you
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not long after sitting down with Marsha
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook invited me to come out to their offices
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Susan California
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And sit down with that
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I'm going to eat one cookie and then
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,600	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Typing
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Could I just get your your name and your title and
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I'm Monika bickert and I lead the policies
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:15,328	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook Monika bickert is in charge of all of Facebook's rules
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,376	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Including their policies on hate speech
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So I asked
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're like why would there be a rule that protects white men
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But not black children
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We have
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We have made our hate
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Speech policies
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,200	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Let me rephrase that
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:35,296	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are hate speech policies have become more detailed over time
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Our main policy is you can attack a person or group of people based on
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A protected characteristic
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A characteristic like race religion or gender
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Set this takes a couple beats to explain that the gist of it is that
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The Facebook borrow this idea of protected classes
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,960	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Straight from us anti.
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Discrimination law
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:56,544	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	These are the laws that make it so that you can't not
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Hire someone
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Say based on like the religion their ethnicity there
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Race
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:05,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so on on Facebook you can't attack someone
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Based on one of these characteristics
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Meaning you can't say menarche
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Nor could you say women are trash
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because eventually you're attacking all men for being men
EDL	00:36:17,024	00:36:18,560	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So is it the all
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Can I say Bob is trash you can say Bob is
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because at my stores explain to me
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The distinction is that in the first instance you're attacking
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A category
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the second instance you're attacking a
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,896	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Person but it's not clear that you're attacking that person be
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,664	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cuz
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They are a member of a
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Actor category
EDL	00:36:35,968	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Oh so Bob might be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being a man he just might be
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Right okay so that explains why you take down men are scum but why would you
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Leave up
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Black children
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Hawaii weather
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:49,792	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So traditionally we allowed
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Speech
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Once there was some other word in it
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That made it about something other than a protected characteristic
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:01,568	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In Facebook jargon these are referred to as
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:04,640	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	AIA non-protected mod
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sapphire
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:10,016	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just beans and literally nothing to give us an example of this
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So traditionally if you said I don't like
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,368	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This religion
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cab drivers
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cab driver would be the non protect
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Did modifier because
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Employment
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is not a protector
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Category
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so what the rules stated was
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When you add this non-protected modifier to a protected category
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In this case the cabdrivers religion we would allow it because
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We can't assume that you're hating is person because of his religion you actually just may not like
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cab driver
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:46,368	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So in the case of black children children is modifying the
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,392	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Protected category
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Black
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Pizza children Trump's black
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Age is a non-protected category
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Okay so
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:57,376	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Children
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:00,704	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Becomes a non-protected modifier
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they're their there
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,520	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Childness
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,056	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Trump's their blackness
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,872	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You can say whatever you want about black chilled
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Whereas in the case of white men you've got you've got gender and race
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Both protected
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:16,576	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You can attack them
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:18,880	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's just a bizarre rule
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I would think you would go the other direction
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That you d protected class would outweigh the modify
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well they they made this decision
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:30,400	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As they plan to meet because their default was to allow
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:35,520	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They were really trying to incorporate or nod to the American free speech
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is it
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we say this is
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So bad we're going to take it down
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And that in this case their concern was
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're all members of like you know at least half a dozen protect
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The categories like we all have gender
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We all have sexual orientation
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,512	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If you made the rule is that
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Anytime
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Protected
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Class is mentioned
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It could be hate
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What you are doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	On Facebook to potentially be hates me
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then you're not left with anything
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Turn right no matter where we draw this line they're going to be stopped some outcomes that we don't like
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're always going to be casualties
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's why we continue to change the policy
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in fact
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:26,720	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Since March is debacle they've actually updated this rule
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So now black children are protected from what they considered the worst
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:31,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Forms
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Now car reviewers
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Take how severe the attack is
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Into consideration
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:45,152	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But despite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Marcia who think they're still just isn't good enough
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:48,736	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There are not
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,528	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Systematic efforts
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She thinks
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	White men in heterosexual should not be protected
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Protect the group
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Who are actually victims of hate
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,120	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Makes sense
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,424	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Oh yeah because in sort of hate speech
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,704	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're thinking about hate speech
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:14,336	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There's this idea of privilege door of historically disadvantaged groups
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And that those historically disadvantaged
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Groups should have more protection
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because of
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Being historically disadvantaged
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the challenge with that that was presented to me was
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Okay
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the 1940s
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:33,280	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cut off the Chinese
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,328	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Caffe in change if you had
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,608	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Japanese soldiers
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:39,168	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Chinese
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Showing millions of China
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	During World War II
EDL	00:40:43,520	00:40:49,408	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At that same time you had Japanese-American Citizens
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Would have to move
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:53,760	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Being put into internment
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,832	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so we have to ask ourselves a question like
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,880	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are the Japanese and historically
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,672	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Advantage or disadvantage group
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:02,976	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Japanese Americans
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But in China it is a totally different story
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In this happened at the exact same moment
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You got two different places to differ
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cultural
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When you have a website like
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:17,312	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	My Facebook
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Transnational community
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They realize that they decided that ideas of privilege
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,480	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are so geographically bound
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That there is no way
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:33,952	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To evade actively weigh and consider who is privileged above who
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And decided therefore
EDL	00:41:35,232	00:41:40,352	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That we are not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I into the equation
EDL	00:41:42,656	00:41:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I think it's very important to keep in mind here
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The moderators only have like four five seconds to make a decision
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:42:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In those four seconds is there enough time to
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Did to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given IP addresses can easily be mask
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:14,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is it enough time to figure out a person's ethnicity
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	On top of that we often don't know an individual's race
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Other categories are even less clear like sexual orientation
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they've they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When we were
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Building.
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Framework we did a lot of cats
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And we saw some
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sometimes that it was just too hard for reviewers
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To implement
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A more detailed
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A policy
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Consistently
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They just couldn't do it
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Accurately
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We want the policies to be sufficiently detailed to take into account all different types of scenarios
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But simple enough
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:56,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That we can apply them consistently
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Can accurately around the world
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the reality is anytime that the policies become more complicated we see dips in our consistency
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What Facebook's trying to do is take
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:09,183	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The First Amendment this
EDL	00:43:09,183	00:43:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	High-minded lofty legal concept
EDL	00:43:12,255	00:43:16,351	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In converted into an engineering manual
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That can be executed every 4 seconds
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:22,751	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And when you got to move that fast
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sometimes Justice
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Lose it
EDL	00:43:28,127	00:43:30,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's the that's the tension here
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I just want to
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Make sure I emphasize that
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	These policies
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're not going to please everybody they often don't don't
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If we want to have one line
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The reinforced
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Consistently
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bennett means
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We have to have some pretty objective
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Black and white rule
EDL	00:44:07,295	00:44:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Coca-Cola
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Very funny
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When we come back
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Those rules
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bacon tapas
EDL	00:44:33,663	00:44:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is Danny from Denver Colorado
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Enhancing public understanding of Science and Technology in the modern world

EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I'm here because I need your
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I request
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:45:07,967	00:45:08,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Brilliance
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How did they do that
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:22,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To you
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score

EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Taking the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:40,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It doesn't have anything to do with it

EDL	00:46:12,479	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So as we just heard before the break
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook is trying to do two competing things at
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're trying to make rules that are just
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But at the same time can be reliably X
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Executed by thousands
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People spread across the globe in ways that are fair
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Consistent
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I would argue that this balancing a
EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was put to the test
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	April 15th

EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Two pressure-cooker bombs
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:03,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Through the crowd near the Finish Line Boston
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The answer to the dust begin to settle
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Oh my God
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People are springing into action
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:22,367	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Add this one man in a cowboy hat season spectator who's been injured

EDL	00:47:24,671	00:47:28,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Announce they're pushing him through they're the sort of ashy cloud
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:31,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There's a photographer there any snaps this phone
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the photo show is the runner in the cowboy hat
EDL	00:47:37,983	00:47:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And these two other people pushing this man
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Who I
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	His face is Ashen from all of the debris
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is hair is there two standing on end and you can tell that actually the force of the blast and then the the particles that got
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Tanner actually holding it in this sort of wedge shape
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	One of his legs is completely blown off
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the second one is blown off
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's it horrified
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Meanwhile

EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:16,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I remember Snippets of the day
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook employees for clustering around several days
EDL	00:48:19,967	00:48:21,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Staring at the computer screen
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:22,783	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Watching the news break
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kern just in the last half-hour or so I have memories of
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:31,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Watching some of the coverage has just released
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:36,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Of the Boston bombing remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that
EDL	00:48:37,631	00:48:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I posted on Facebook
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	From the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but
EDL	00:48:45,311	00:48:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Pretty quickly
EDL	00:48:46,591	00:48:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Photos going viral
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And we realized
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're going to have to deal with it
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This image is spreading like wildfire
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:58,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It appears to be way out
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Side the rules they'd written by its in this
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Totally new country
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,023	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So together team together
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:06,047	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sat down in the conference
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:09,375	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Should we allow it or should they take it down
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	According to the rules
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah so if you recall the no insides on the outsides definition that we hadn't placed
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Meeting
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:21,151	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You can't see like
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:23,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People's organs or that sort of thing
EDL	00:49:23,455	00:49:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And if you can then we wouldn't allow it
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in this
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:28,319	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In this photo you can see
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You can definitely
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so by the rules the photo should obviously
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Come down yep
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	However
EDL	00:49:34,463	00:49:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Have to run says
EDL	00:49:35,999	00:49:36,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	No
EDL	00:49:36,767	00:49:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The other people are saying
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is news
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Essentially this phone is being posted everywhere else it's important
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We need to suspend the rules
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We need to make an exception
EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which immediately receive push back while I was saying that
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What we've prided ourselves on was not making those calls
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And there are no exception
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There's either
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are there mistakes
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Orange Roofing
EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We made the guideline for moments like this
EDL	00:50:03,391	00:50:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Twitch the other side shoot back oh my God are you kidding me like
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	F****** kidding me damn the guidelines must have common sense your lips
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The humans we know that this isn't
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	End
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah there
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Kind of
EDL	00:50:18,495	00:50:19,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The right
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The reality is like
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If you say
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well we allowed it because it's newsworthy
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How do you answer
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Any of the questions about any of the rest of the
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In other words this is a Pandora's
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in fact for reasons that are totally clear team consistency team follow the rules
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Eventually wins the day
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They decide to take the photo down
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But before they can pull the lever
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Word starts making its way up to
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And internally within Facebook
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:53,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	According to my sources in executive under Zuckerberg sent down in order
EDL	00:50:53,567	00:50:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We were essentially
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I told
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:56,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Make the exception
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The photos
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You're not taking this down
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:08,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yes
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's what happened
EDL	00:51:12,767	00:51:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This decision means
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If Facebook has just become a publisher
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Whitley.
EDL	00:51:18,655	00:51:19,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I think maybe they have
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bucket Maiden news judgment
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And just really knowing they've become CBS ABC near time and Atlantic
EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A news organization yeah
EDL	00:51:31,711	00:51:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I in this brings up a legal question that that's at the center
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Of of this conversation about free speech
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is Facebook a sort of collective
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Scrapbook for a cell or is it a public
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Square where you should be able to say whatever you want
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:46,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Or
EDL	00:51:46,815	00:51:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah it is it now in uzor
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Currency election
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I'm sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	How to release what year
EDL	00:51:54,495	00:51:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You talk too much
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What exactly
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:51:57,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook is
EDL	00:51:58,079	00:52:00,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And this question has been popping up a lot reason
EDL	00:52:00,895	00:52:02,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In fact it even came up
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This past April
EDL	00:52:03,711	00:52:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	When Zuckerberg was testifying in front
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Congress
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I think about a hundred
EDL	00:52:07,807	00:52:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	40 million
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:10,367	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Americans get their news from
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook
EDL	00:52:11,647	00:52:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So

EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The primary thing that
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We do is build
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:25,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Technology and products
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Well
EDL	00:52:30,847	00:52:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I agree that we were
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Responsible for the count
EDL	00:52:34,175	00:52:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Compatible with
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Fundamentally yet
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At our core
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bia technology
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Company were the main thing that we do is having
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,575	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Engineers and Bill product
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Basically Zuckerberg and others at the company are arguing no
EDL	00:52:44,159	00:52:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There not a new Darkness
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:47,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Why what would be the downside of that
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Will Facebook currently
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sits on this little idyllic illegal Island where
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They can't be held liable for much of anything there
EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Subjected to few regulations
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	However were they to be seen in the eyes of the court and the media organization
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That could change
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But setting that aside what really strikes me about all of this
EDL	00:53:08,991	00:53:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is it here you have a company that really
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That are both
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As objective as possible
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And can be executed as consistently
EDL	00:53:23,327	00:53:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they've been willing to sacrifice
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:28,703	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Rather large ideas in in the name of this thing
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Forgettable privilege
EDL	00:53:29,727	00:53:30,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which we talk
EDL	00:53:30,495	00:53:34,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What about that they decided was to geographically bound to allow for 1
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:36,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But if
EDL	00:53:36,895	00:53:39,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If you ask me that there's nothing more
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:42,783	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Subjective or geographically bound
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:47,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Then what people find interesting or important what what people
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:48,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Find newsworthy
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Don't get it and I'll give you I'll give you a great example of this
EDL	00:53:52,767	00:53:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They haven't just six months after the Boston area
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Embalming when this video starts
EDL	00:53:57,887	00:53:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Out of northern Mexico
EDL	00:53:59,679	00:54:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And it's a video of a
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A woman being
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Grab
EDL	00:54:04,543	00:54:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And forced onto her knees in front of a camera
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then a man
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	With his face covered
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Grabs her head pulled her head back in
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Slices
EDL	00:54:13,247	00:54:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Her head off right in front of the
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And this video starts being spread
EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:21,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I can't count how many times I just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like
EDL	00:54:21,951	00:54:24,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	One person came across this video or at least
EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Dozens of others like it was Shannon Young
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:30,399	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	My name is Shannon Young I am a freelance radio reporter
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Been living here in Mexico for for many years now and then is covering the drug war in doing so years back she know
EDL	00:54:36,799	00:54:38,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Noticed this strange phenomena
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It first caught my attention in early 2010 Dragon social media you know your scroll
EDL	00:54:44,735	00:54:49,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Run through your feet and he know you'd see all this news people say there was a three-hour gunbattle and
EDL	00:54:49,855	00:54:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Intense fighting all weekend long for posting about clashes between drug cartels
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:55,743	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Government forces
EDL	00:54:56,255	00:54:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But then when Shannon would watch the news that night
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:05,983	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sheep the reports on the economy and
EDL	00:55:05,983	00:55:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Soccer results but the media wasn't covering it
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:10,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There be no mention of these attacks
EDL	00:55:10,847	00:55:13,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Nothing to do with the violence
EDL	00:55:13,407	00:55:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so she another journalist
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Try to get the bottom of
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Reporters in Mexico City with contact State authorities and they know public information officer and they be like shootings bombing
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	What are you talking about
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Nothing's going on we have no reports of anything
EDL	00:55:26,207	00:55:27,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	These are just internet rumors
EDL	00:55:27,999	00:55:30,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The government even coined a term for these sorts of posts
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:34,143	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The famous phrase of the time was Collective psychosis
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:38,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	These people are crazy because you know they didn't want the situation to seem out of control
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But then a video is
EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:48,479	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It opens
EDL	00:55:48,479	00:55:51,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Looking out the windshield of a car on a sunny day
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The landscape is dry Dusty
EDL	00:55:53,343	00:55:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Videos of a shaky clearly shot on a phone
EDL	00:55:57,183	00:56:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then the woman taping star
EDL	00:56:03,583	00:56:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cards talk
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This woman she just narrates
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:09,215	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As they drive along this
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Highway
EDL	00:56:10,495	00:56:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sheet pans the phone from the passenger window to the to the Wynn
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Windshield
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Focusing in on these two silver destroyed pickup trucks
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And she said look at these cars over here are there if you know shut up and eat
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Mercure unibus 18-wheeler as you know totally abandon it got shot up
EDL	00:56:34,559	00:56:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	1 Point sheet
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Stick the phone out the window to show all of the bullet casings
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:42,239	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Littering the ground
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:45,823	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And she just turn the the official Denial on it
EDL	00:56:45,823	00:56:46,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Ted
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The government was saying there's no violence
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Here were cars riddled with bullets
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was impossible to dismiss
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:56,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And from then on
EDL	00:56:57,343	00:57:00,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You had more and more citizens
EDL	00:57:00,927	00:57:04,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Citizen journalists uploading anonymously
EDL	00:57:04,255	00:57:07,583	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Video of the violence
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:12,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	He's Lo-Fi shaky shots of
EDL	00:57:12,959	00:57:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Shootout dismemberment
EDL	00:57:18,591	00:57:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Beheadings I mean
EDL	00:57:20,895	00:57:22,175	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bodies hanging
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Dangling off of overpasses
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Proved the world that this is really happening
EDL	00:57:37,023	00:57:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We're not crazy
EDL	00:57:42,143	00:57:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's a cry for help
EDL	00:57:43,679	00:57:44,191	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:47,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Which brings us back to that beheading V
EDL	00:57:49,055	00:57:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah that video of the beheading
EDL	00:57:51,615	00:57:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A lot of people are uploading it condemning the violence
EDL	00:57:53,919	00:57:54,431	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The drug cartel
EDL	00:57:54,943	00:57:56,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And when it started showing up on Facebook
EDL	00:57:56,991	00:57:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Much like with the Boston Marathon bombing photo
EDL	00:58:00,063	00:58:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This team of people they sat down in a room looked at the policy of weight the arguments
EDL	00:58:04,927	00:58:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And my argument was
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was okay by the rules during the Boston bombing
EDL	00:58:09,023	00:58:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Why isn't it okay now
EDL	00:58:10,303	00:58:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Particularly
EDL	00:58:11,327	00:58:15,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Given that it could help leaving this up means we warned hundreds of thousands of people at the brutality of these cartels
EDL	00:58:16,703	00:58:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We kept it up
EDL	00:58:20,799	00:58:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	However
EDL	00:58:21,823	00:58:22,847	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's f****** Raw
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:24,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's why I think it's
EDL	00:58:24,895	00:58:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Oxalate responsible and impact quiet despicable of them
EDL	00:58:27,967	00:58:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People found out
EDL	00:58:28,991	00:58:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I have little neighbor kid
EDL	00:58:31,807	00:58:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It like that
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Backlash
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Application for Lawrence
EDL	00:58:35,903	00:58:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Videos to people as powerful as David
EDL	00:58:37,951	00:58:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cameron Wake
EDL	00:58:39,999	00:58:41,279	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Today's appointment is done
EDL	00:58:41,279	00:58:44,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Stony criticized the move thing we have to protect children from this
EDL	00:58:45,119	00:58:46,399	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	David Cameron tweeted
EDL	00:58:46,911	00:58:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's irresponsible of Facebook to post
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Beheading videos
EDL	00:58:51,007	00:58:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People were really upset because of what it was
EDL	00:58:53,311	00:58:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so according to my sources
EDL	00:58:55,615	00:59:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Some of the folks involved in making this decision to leave it up or once again taken into an executive's office
EDL	00:59:01,503	00:59:02,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And so we went up
EDL	00:59:02,527	00:59:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And and there was a lot of
EDL	00:59:04,575	00:59:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Internal pressure to remove it
EDL	00:59:06,367	00:59:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I go to my boss and say Hey look
EDL	00:59:09,183	00:59:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is the decision we made
EDL	00:59:10,719	00:59:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I recognize this
EDL	00:59:11,487	00:59:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	This is controversial I want to let you know why we made these decisions
EDL	00:59:14,559	00:59:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they made their case
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There are valid and important human rights reasons why you would want this to be out there to show the kind of
EDL	00:59:20,703	00:59:21,215	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Savage
EDL	00:59:21,983	00:59:23,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And she vehement Lee
EDL	00:59:24,543	00:59:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They took another approach arguing that if we take this down you're deciding to punish people who are trying to raise awareness
EDL	00:59:30,175	00:59:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Again
EDL	00:59:30,943	00:59:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She wasn't budging and just didn't get
EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Didn't get passed
EDL	00:59:35,295	00:59:36,063	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	00:59:36,063	00:59:37,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Ultimately
EDL	00:59:37,599	00:59:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I was overruled
EDL	00:59:39,391	00:59:40,415	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And we removed it
EDL	00:59:42,207	00:59:48,351	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just because there was pressure to do so the same people that six months prior told them to leave it up because of his music
EDL	00:59:49,119	00:59:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Said take the video down
EDL	00:59:51,167	00:59:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Reverse a decision in band a video post
EDL	00:59:54,495	00:59:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Go to the site of a woman thing
EDL	00:59:56,031	00:59:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The headed
EDL	00:59:57,311	00:59:58,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook
EDL	00:59:58,079	00:59:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A quote when
EDL	00:59:59,359	01:00:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If you want the one from Boston and you probably should have the one for Mexico and right
EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It was a mistake
EDL	01:00:06,527	01:00:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:07,551	01:00:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I think it was a mistake
EDL	01:00:10,111	01:00:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because I
EDL	01:00:11,135	01:00:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I felt like
EDL	01:00:12,671	01:00:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like why do we have these rules in place in the first
EDL	01:00:16,255	01:00:17,023	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	01:00:17,023	01:00:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And it's not the
EDL	01:00:18,815	01:00:19,839	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The only reason
EDL	01:00:20,607	01:00:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But decisions like that
EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are the thing that precipitated melee
EDL	01:00:27,007	01:00:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Leaving
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yep
EDL	01:00:28,543	01:00:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Not too long after that incident a few members of the team decided to quit
EDL	01:00:33,919	01:00:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And what would I think this story shows
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is that
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Facebook has become
EDL	01:00:39,551	01:00:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Too many different things at the same
EDL	01:00:41,855	01:00:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The Facebook is now
EDL	01:00:43,903	01:00:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Turtle playground
EDL	01:00:45,439	01:00:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's also an R-rated movie theater
EDL	01:00:48,511	01:00:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And now it's the front page of a newspaper
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	My mother thinks the same time it's all distinct at the same time and in what we
EDL	01:00:56,447	01:00:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The users are demanding of them
EDL	01:00:58,751	01:01:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is that they create a set of policies that are
EDL	01:01:01,055	01:01:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just
EDL	01:01:02,079	01:01:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And the reality is just as means a very different thing in each one of these setting
EDL	01:01:06,687	01:01:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Justice would mean that the person in Mexico gets told the truth
EDL	01:01:10,015	01:01:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In Mexico by Facebook
EDL	01:01:11,807	01:01:16,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	A little boy in England doesn't have to look at something gory and horrible in England
EDL	01:01:16,927	01:01:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But you can't put them together
EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because they Clash
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Exactly
EDL	01:01:21,279	01:01:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So how do you solve that
EDL	01:01:24,095	01:01:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The I don't know
EDL	01:01:26,143	01:01:27,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I think it's important to keep in mind
EDL	01:01:28,447	01:01:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That even if you have the perfect set of policies that
EDL	01:01:32,543	01:01:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That somehow managed to be just in different settings and that
EDL	01:01:35,871	01:01:37,151	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	To be consistently enforced
EDL	01:01:38,175	01:01:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The people at the end of the day making these
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:40,735	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Decision
EDL	01:01:41,247	01:01:45,599	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They're still there still
EDL	01:01:46,879	01:01:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Still human beings
EDL	01:01:48,159	01:01:49,695	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Is the office working or no
EDL	01:01:49,695	01:01:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I can hear you
EDL	01:01:50,975	01:01:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah great okay
EDL	01:01:52,767	01:01:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	At long last we figured it out huh
EDL	01:01:55,071	01:01:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Yeah clearly
EDL	01:01:56,863	01:01:59,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I spoke to one woman who did this work for face
EDL	01:01:59,423	01:02:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Buckeyes want to be
EDL	01:02:00,959	01:02:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Anonymous I don't want
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Dump even know that I'm doing it because
EDL	01:02:05,567	01:02:07,103	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They might file charges against
EDL	01:02:07,615	01:02:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Will call her Marie
EDL	01:02:09,151	01:02:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She's from the Philippines where
EDL	01:02:10,943	01:02:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She grew up on a coffee Farm
EDL	01:02:13,247	01:02:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That's my father's
EDL	01:02:14,527	01:02:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Stop grow
EDL	01:02:15,807	01:02:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And I didn't know that coffee was only for adults
EDL	01:02:19,135	01:02:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She said many afternoons while she was growing up
EDL	01:02:22,975	01:02:24,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She and her mother would sit together
EDL	01:02:25,279	01:02:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Side
EDL	01:02:26,047	01:02:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Sipping their coffee and
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:29,119	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Tuning into the shortwave
EDL	01:02:31,423	01:02:32,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Washington DC
EDL	01:02:33,215	01:02:34,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And they sit there
EDL	01:02:34,495	01:02:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Listening to The Voice of America
EDL	01:02:36,799	01:02:37,311	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Silent
EDL	01:02:38,335	01:02:40,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I'm going to ask that we all
EDL	01:02:40,383	01:02:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Bobbleheads
EDL	01:02:41,407	01:02:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She said one of her favorite things to catch on Voice of America where Billy Graham's
EDL	01:02:46,271	01:02:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Billy Graham one of the great evangelist
EDL	01:02:49,087	01:02:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Our Father we thank thee for this
EDL	01:02:51,135	01:02:51,903	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Love of God
EDL	01:02:53,951	01:02:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That reaches around the world
EDL	01:02:55,999	01:02:56,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Xiamen golf
EDL	01:02:59,583	01:03:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But then
EDL	01:03:05,215	01:03:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Fast forward 50 years to 2010 and Marie is consuming a very different sort of American Media
EDL	01:03:10,847	01:03:12,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	The videos were the ones that affected me
EDL	01:03:13,663	01:03:15,455	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There were times when I felt
EDL	01:03:15,455	01:03:19,551	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Really bad that I am a Christian and then I look into these things
EDL	01:03:20,063	01:03:25,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She became a Content moderator back in 2010 and was actually one of the first people in the Philippines doing this work
EDL	01:03:27,231	01:03:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Usually had the night shift
EDL	01:03:29,535	01:03:35,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	In the early morning or in the dawn from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She work from home and despite it being dark she put blankets up over the windows so no one could see in at what she was look
EDL	01:03:42,847	01:03:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Cheap lock the door to keep
EDL	01:03:44,383	01:03:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Superkids out
EDL	01:03:45,407	01:03:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Are you have to go drive them away
EDL	01:03:47,199	01:03:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Alright without them. It's Otto
EDL	01:03:49,503	01:03:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Making of Watch
EDL	01:03:51,295	01:03:54,879	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And she and the other moderators on her team who lived throughout the Philippine
EDL	01:03:55,391	01:03:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	They were trained on the guideline
EDL	01:03:57,183	01:03:57,951	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	On this robot
EDL	01:03:58,463	01:04:01,535	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	There were policies if you have to adhere to
EDL	01:04:02,047	01:04:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Some of us were
EDL	01:04:03,839	01:04:04,607	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Redis
EDL	01:04:04,607	01:04:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Gleeking passpasspass even if it's not really fast
EDL	01:04:08,191	01:04:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Spanish
EDL	01:04:09,727	01:04:11,263	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Just to get through the content fast
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And in some cases she thinks
EDL	01:04:13,823	01:04:15,359	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Number of the moderators
EDL	01:04:15,359	01:04:16,127	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	My doing it
EDL	01:04:16,127	01:04:18,687	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As a form of retaliation for the low rate
EDL	01:04:19,199	01:04:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	People were pissed at the low pay
EDL	01:04:21,247	01:04:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If I can ask how much what how much were you making an hour doing
EDL	01:04:25,087	01:04:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	As far as I remember it
EDL	01:04:27,903	01:04:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	We were babies
EDL	01:04:29,439	01:04:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Like $2.50
EDL	01:04:31,487	01:04:32,255	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Where our
EDL	01:04:32,767	01:04:36,863	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Marie wouldn't say whether or not this low-wage led her to just
EDL	01:04:36,863	01:04:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Let things through
EDL	01:04:38,143	01:04:39,935	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	But she did say
EDL	01:04:39,935	01:04:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Based on my
EDL	01:04:41,471	01:04:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Ghost background
EDL	01:04:44,543	01:04:47,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	That I can look objectively at
EDL	01:04:49,151	01:04:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So I reject many of the things that I
EDL	01:04:52,735	01:04:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Think are not
EDL	01:04:54,271	01:04:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Acceptable
EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:56,319	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Really
EDL	01:04:56,831	01:04:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Of course
EDL	01:04:57,855	01:05:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She said whether something with outside the rules or not
EDL	01:05:00,927	01:05:02,463	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If forgot told her to
EDL	01:05:02,975	01:05:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	She just took it down
EDL	01:05:04,511	01:05:06,559	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Whenever it affects me a lot
EDL	01:05:06,559	01:05:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I would click the button.
EDL	01:05:08,863	01:05:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's a violation
EDL	01:05:10,143	01:05:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Because if it's going to disturb the young or
EDL	01:05:14,495	01:05:16,031	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And he should not be there
EDL	01:05:16,031	01:05:17,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So
EDL	01:05:17,567	01:05:19,615	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	If there's a nude person
EDL	01:05:19,615	01:05:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Whether it was a breastfeeding photo or an anatomy video or a piece of art
EDL	01:05:24,479	01:05:27,039	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	I would consider it that's pornography
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:28,831	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	And then
EDL	01:05:29,343	01:05:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Right away
EDL	01:05:31,391	01:05:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	It's a violation
EDL	01:05:33,183	01:05:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	You took the law into your own hands you went vigilante
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Say something
EDL	01:05:41,375	01:05:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	So yeah I have to
EDL	01:05:43,423	01:05:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Protect kids
EDL	01:05:45,983	01:05:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	From
EDL	01:05:48,031	01:05:49,055	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Evil
EDL	01:05:50,335	01:05:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Site of humankind
EDL	01:06:33,343	01:06:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Where does that leave you feeling good leave you feeling at this is just at the end this is
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:39,487	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	System
EDL	01:06:39,999	01:06:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	Undoable
EDL	01:06:42,815	01:06:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18postnoevil |	II
