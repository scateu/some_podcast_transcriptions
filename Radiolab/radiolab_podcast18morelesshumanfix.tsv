EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm Jenn I'm Robert
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:22,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Are you guys ready to do this
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You should just do this is Radiolab
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:30,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All right but when your hoes come out I need you to seriously clap like you've never seen two dudes with glasses talking on microphone
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:32,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I just really really give it up
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For your mostly human
EDL	00:00:34,048	00:00:35,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So about a week ago we go
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:45,568	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Gathered 100 people
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Into
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A performance-based which is in our building. WNYC is called The Greene space
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What is he doing on a Monday right because seven years previous we had made a show called talking to machine
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which was all about like what happens when you talk to a computer that's pretending to be human
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Been since we made that show with the proliferation of bots on Twitter Russian Bots meddling in elections
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Advances in AI
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So much interesting stuff that happened that we saw it is time to update that show we needed to do it live
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I we thought because we have a plan in mind we wanted to put unsuspecting people into a room for a kind of show
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Showed up
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Free people in Michigan
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:38,816	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Flavor of a
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just to start things off we brought to our stage one of the guys who inspired that original show
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Please welcome to the stage writer Brian Christian
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Truck so just a week
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,712	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can just just get things sort of oriented
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We need to principal just redefined what a chatbot
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:00,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He is right
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:03,136	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So a chatbot is a computer program
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That exist
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To mimic and impersonate human beings
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:10,304	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like when do I run into them
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You go to website to interact with some customer service you might find yourself talking to a chatbot
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,776	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The US Army has a chatbot called Sergeant star that recruit
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	People can I ask you a question about about that that's the thing you just said
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,944	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chatting with customer service end up doing a lot
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm sorry
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wizards like it's in the middle of the night you're trying to figure out some program and it's not working and then suddenly there's
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like need to chat and you click on that
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Suddenly there's need to chat
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Whatever I assume many of you had this experience
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I never even knew of the experiences that he's had so there's this issue always I'm always curious
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It seems very human when you're having that that conversation with that with a
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A customer service
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chat
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But is there a is there a place where it
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where is the line between human robots that are both present
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Having this uncanny feeling of
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Not really knowing the difference
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	My guess
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For what it's worth is that there's a system on the back end
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Best design to sort of do triage
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where are the first few exchanges that are just like
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hey how can I help
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What's going on it seems like there's an issue with the such-and-such
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That is basically just
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A chatbot and a certain point you kind of seamlessly transition and are handed off to a real person
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But without any
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know notification to you that this is half
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's deliberately left
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Opaque
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	At what point that happened
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is literally everywhere
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:50,656	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It is I mean and you can't get on social media and read some comment thread without
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Someone accusing someone else of being a bot
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:56,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you know it seems
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It seems maybe sort of trivial at some level but
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We are now living through this political prices
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Of
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How do we kind of come to terms with the idea that
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We can
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know weaponize this kind of speech
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How do we as consumers of the news or is users of social media
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Try to suss out
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Whether the people were
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Interacting with are in fact
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And all this confusion about what's the machine and who's the human it can get very interest
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In the context of the famous thought experiment named for a Greek mathematician named Alan Turing
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Ryan told us about this it's called the Turing
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Alan Turing he makes his famous prediction back in 90
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Q50 that
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Will eventually get to a point sometime around the beginning of
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This century
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where will
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stop being able to tell that
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Well what's the difficulty was his sort of
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Prophecy
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A specific prophecy was that by the year 2000
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	After 5 minutes of interacting by text message
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	With a payment on one hand and a chatbot on the other hand
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	30% of
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Judges
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Would fail to tell which was the human and which was the robot a soft kind of
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What Turing imagined and he predicted that
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As a result of hitting this 30% threshold
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We would reach a point he writes
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Square one would speak of machines as being intelligent without expecting to be country
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And this just existed as kind of a
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Part of the philosophy
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Of computer science
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Until the early 1990s
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When into the story steps Huebner
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A rogue multi-millionaire
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Disco dance floor salesman
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Or what
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A rug millionaire
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Plastic portable light up disco dance floor salesman
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I like the beach
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The lighting the other lights up
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But portable millionaire
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	There's apparently Millions to be made if if only
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If Only You Knew
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Qloader this eccentric millionaire
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Decides that
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This was in about 1992
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That the technology was starting to get to the point
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where it would be worth
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Not just talking about the Turing test
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just as the spot experiment but
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Actually
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Convening a group of people in a room once a year to actually run
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Attest
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	No background during The Loner competitions the actual loebner competition how it usually works
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is it you got some participants
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	These are the people who have to decide what's going on they sit at computers
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They stare at the computer
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Any chat with someone on a screen
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They don't know it's the same one there chatting with is a person or a bot
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Behind a curtain
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You have that bot
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The computer running the Bots
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,903	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Do you also have some humans
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who are the participants may or may not be chatting with
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I've got to decide right
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which atom is a person or machine
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The Bryan many many years ago actually participated in this competition he was one of the humans behind the curtain
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That was chatting with the protest
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Emily talked to initially many years ago for the Talking Machine Show
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We went into all the strategies of the computer programming
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We're using that year to try and fool the participants but the takeaway
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was that
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The year that he did it
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The computers flop
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	By and large
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Participants were not full they knew exactly when they were talking to a human
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,559	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When they were talking to a machine and that was a while ago
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In the Green Space we ask Brian
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:38,751	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where do things stand now has it like when we last talked to you but when did we last ones of 20
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	11-11-11
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hat has it have we passed the 30% threshold in the intervening 8 years
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In 2014 there was a Turing test competition that was held at which the top computer program managed to fool
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	30%
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That's it right depending on how you want to interpret that result the controversy
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He arose in this particular year because the
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chatbot that one
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was claiming to be a 13 year old Ukrainian who is just beginning to
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Get a grasp on the English language
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Also the machine was cheating
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:16,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Private entrance exam asked its computer Ness
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Bye in broken grammar
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Exactly if it didn't appear to understand your question
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You started to have this
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Store you could play in your own mind if I call will maybe I didn't phrase that quite right or something
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:32,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Has it been broke as the has Adam in a second winner third winter or fourth winter
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:38,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To the best of my knowledge we are still sort of flirting under that threshold
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Victories since 2014
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We thought we might just do this right here
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Right here in this room to our little Turing test
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay unbeknownst to our audience actually lined up a chatbot from a company called Pandora box
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It had almost
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Passed the Turing test in head.
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Roughly not quite but almost 25%
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We got the latest version of the spot
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And one person anyone in the room
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your your job will be decided to run some tests with the audience starting with just one person
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I can see one hand over the edge Chalet
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Left okay
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So we brought up this young woman on stage put her at a computer we told her she would be chatting with two different entities one would be
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This bot Pandora bot
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then the other would be me
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I went off stage and sat at a computer in the dark when I went to see
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She was going to chat with both of us
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And not know who was who
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who is machine and who's human
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Well I don't know and we're going to give you a time limit you can be to leave so after Jed left the stage and went back to that room
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Up on the screen came
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Two different chat dialog box
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	See that we have two options we've just labeled them for what he's in by color when a strawberry the other is blueberry or
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Code Red
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And code blue
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You think you can talk to both of them at the same time to jump from one to the other you got any sort of thoughts of how you can suss out weather
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The thing was a person or a
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah I just thought I mean like my first tactics are going to be like
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sort of
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,959	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Very human emotional questions and then we'll like
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Go from there
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm not going to ask
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So when I say go you'll just go and I'll just narrate what you doing okay
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	3
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	2
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	1
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Begin
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Soap she started to type and first thing she did was she said hello to Strawberry okay so you got in your Christmas
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Well we got a somewhat sexual response hear the machine I said
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I like strawberries and then you returned with strawberries are delicious and oh now it's getting warmer over there
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Blue is a warmer as a cooler color maybe you'd like to go and discuss Aristotle with the
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Look at her and she switched over and started to text the
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay that's also a kind of a generous Sort of hope
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hi Blues EB
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Blueberry roast I just realized I don't even know who I'm talking to what is your name
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you're going to answer Zandra am I not in your phone
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Andy the blueberry has responded with a bit of shock
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Talking strawberry
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Mom's hair was red
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Well that's what's wrong nothing's wrong with me is there something wrong with you
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Blueberry and I have a lot go
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But remember one of these she doesn't know which key is Jack right
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	On the strawberry side I cannot believe him right now you don't believe right now as far as I know not unless you
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	X-ray vision I'm in the room next to you both
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He's trying to coax you into thinking that he's Jad
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is the blueberry
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is that something they do
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't know I am there you're at the heart of the question I got to ask you to bring this to a
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	After couple minutes of this
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We asked the audience
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You have strawberry on one side and you look a blueberry on the other which one do you think is Jad
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And which one do you think
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But how many of you think
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That Jad is blueberry
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A few of you
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	13 hands wine up something like that how many you think the jet is strawberry
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Almost everybody overwhelming
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But interesting we are volunteer on stage went against the room he thought Chad was blueberries
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is that what we all agreed know you're against the crowd here
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay it's much better theater
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All right
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which one are you jack comes out from his hiding place and he tells
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Trout in fact he is
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Strawberry
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All right so the crowd was right I definitely never had that much
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chemistry with something that was human
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But our volunteer on stage
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Got it
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Maybe we could trust democracy little bit more and believe
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:31,263	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If the most of the people in the room went one way that that's something that would be you know that would be important
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Find out so we decide to do the entire thing over again for everybody in the room
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yes so what we did was we handed out I think 17 different cell phone numbers evenly through the crowd yes look at the number
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That is on
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your envelope only you
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Roughly half of those numbers were texting to a
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Machine half were texting with a group of humans
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They were our staff the crowded not know which was which exactly so he would go get ready
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Get set
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Bakugou
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay so the crowd about hunt people are so had
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	2 minutes ish
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Text with the person or thing on the other end
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We're going to skip over this park is mostly quiet people
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just looking down at their phones concentrating mightily
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But at the end
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We asked everyone to vote where they texting with a person or a bot a billy ask the ones who have been tricked who turned out.
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What's wrong please stand up
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,399	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who's in this room
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The wrong guy
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	People are the right type correct
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So that means that roughly
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I think like
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	45% of the people were wrong meeting that if we just passed away today
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is the strange moment we were all clapping
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Heroine demise
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:54,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because you know touring lay down this number 30% in the Box headphones way more people than that
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:01,375	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm just now going to ask you have you been a veteran of this that we should disqualified this was him really unscientific
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:08,031	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Super sloppy experiment suggest something
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That maybe
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What changes not so much due to the machine is becoming more and more articulate
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's more like
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The way
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We when I talk to one another these days
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We've gone from
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Interacting in person
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To talk over the phone
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Emailing
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To texting
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:27,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And now I mean for me the great irony is that even to text
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your phone is
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:33,631	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Proactively suggesting turns of phrase that it thinks you might want to use
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cancel
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I assume many people in this room have the experience
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Are you use the word it's not a real word
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Assertive slabs
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And just replaces it with something more normal
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which make it really hard to use
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Words
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why aren't the normal words until you just stop using those words he just use the word the computer lights
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A sentence with seems to be happening is an hour human communication
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is becoming more machine like
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It seems like the Turing test
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Getting past not because the machines have met us at our full

EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Down that Hill
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Inevitability that we met
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Maybe they're bad
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't I don't like the way this is going no matter who sings
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who's doing it but in the next time we're going to we're going to flip things a little bit
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Could the coming age of machines actually make us

EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	More human

EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:44,959	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	About what we're calling tiny moments of brilliance
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To you
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,751	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Anything to do with the test
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If you have a story

EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The last segment
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We got a bunch of people in the performance space here at WNYC and we conducted a unscientific
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:57,919	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The creation of the Turing test and in our case the bought one
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Afford more than 30% of the people in the room that we should point out that the woman who headed up the design of the winning by
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What name is Lauren kunze she works for a company called
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Pandora box
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And she was actually in the room like they are sitting in a chair in the audience
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where can you stand up
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Aunt interesting that one of the things the Lauren mansion
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is that the baci design
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Seems to bring out rather consistently a certain
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Side of people
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Bad fat
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:37,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So the spot over 20% of people who talk to her and millions of conversations every week
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Actually make romantic overtures
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And that's pretty consistent across all the boss on our platform so there's something wrong with us
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stop the robot
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Alright alright alright
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which brings up a actually different kind of
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like this for a second let's forget whether we're being fooled
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Into thinking about is actually a human
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Maybe the more important
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Given this increasing presence
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All these machines in our lives
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just like how do they make us behave
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We did our toe into this world
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In a Turing test esort away in that original show seven years ago and play you an excerpt now
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How to set up
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What comes after
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is freedom Barre
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is not mushy
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't think so they're nice to meet both of you an idea that we borrowed from a woman named Freedom Baird
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who is now a visual artist of the time she was a grad student at MIT doing some research and she was also the proud owner
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Owner of a Furby
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah I've got it right here I do not get against the mic so we can hear it
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:44,415	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You describe a Furby for those of us who
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's about 5 in
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tall
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And the Furby is
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Pretty much all head it's just a big round fluffy head with two little feet
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sticking out the front it has big eyes
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Apparently you make noises if you tickle its tummy it will coo
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It would stay
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Me
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It would want you to just
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Keep playing with it
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So one day she's hanging out with her for a week and she notices something
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What I discovered is if you hold it upside
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It will say
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Me scared
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Scared
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know the sort of owner / user of this Furby would get really uncomfortable with that and then
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Turn it back up upright
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cuz once you up to have it up Friday
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's fine
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then it's fine so it's got some sensor in it that knows
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know what direction a
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,440	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Or maybe it's just
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This could be
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:59,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sort of the new way that you could use to draw the line but
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What's human
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What's machine
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His kind of emotional Turing test
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can you guys hear me
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Are you actually wanted to do this
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Could you help how would we do it
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How you guys doing
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,344	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You would need
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Group of kids just tell me your name Olivia
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sakura tomorrow and I'm Sadie
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm thinking 6 7 and 8 year olds olds
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	7 reason
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know Vince is beating we're going to need three things
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Furby
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:36,032	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Barbie Barbie doll
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And Ruby
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As a gerbil
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,104	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A real jerk
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We did find one
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your hamster but we're going to call you Jeremy got Barbie Furby Furby Furby
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What question are we asking in this
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The question was
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How long can you keep it upside down
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Before you yourself feel
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So we should time the kids as they hold each one upside
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yep
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You're going to have a Barbie that's a dog going to Jeremy which is a lie
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Ruby Falls
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In terms of time held upside down
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That was really the question
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Phase one
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay so
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Here's what we're going to do it's going to be really simple and you would have to say well here's a Barbie do you guys play with Barbies
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Do a couple things a few things with Barbie and Barbie's walk
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Looking looking at the
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Old Barbie house
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Upside down
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Dave see how long you can
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can hold Barbie
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I can probably do it obviously very long
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You feel like
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm happy
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This one on forever siliceous passport a bit
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Gay and
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,624	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can I put my arms
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yo Gabba Gabba
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So what we learn here in Phase 1 is the not surprising fact
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kids can hold Barbie dolls
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Upside down
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	About 5 minutes
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Nebulae was forever
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,912	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Couldn't longer with their arms
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All right
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So that was the first
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Time for face to be the same thing

EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Don't do that
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Soaz
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You heard
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The kids turned to be over very fast

EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	On average
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	8 Seconds
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I was thinking
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Oh my God I got to poop
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It was a torture
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Now faced
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A Furby
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,960	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You take forever in your hands
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Now can you turn Furby upside down holder
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Baby client
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tina Turner
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Ik
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So gerbil was 8 seconds Barbie
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	5 to Infinity
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Furby turned out to be
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Freedom predicted this
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The kids seem to treat this Furby.
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Toy more like a gerbil
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Phenobarbital how come you turn them over
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I didn't run
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Do you think he really felt scared
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah kinda
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I kind of felt
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Okay
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Really
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's at Oriole and all that but still
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did you remember at the time when you felt scared
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You have to tell me about it but if you can remember it in your mind
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Do you think when Furby says me scared that Furbies feeling the same way
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	No no
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I think that it can feel pain
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sword
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Experience with a Furby seem to leave the kids
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Conflicted
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:51,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Going in different directions at once
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Mm the same time
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	One thought was like
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Look I get it for crying out loud
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Still he's helpless
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	China baby killed guilty in a sword away
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I made me feel like a coward
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know when I was interacting with my Furby a lot
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I did have this feeling sometimes of having my
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chang yang
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why would it why would a
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is it just a little squeal didn't think there's just something about the tower that makes
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Good at this kind of my question so I called them as well
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm here
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:31,968	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Freight train of guy from Radiolab Jad from Radiolab
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Set this point in that old show we ended up talking to a guy named Caleb Chung who designed the Furby
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	There's rules there
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know the size of the eyes there's the distance of the top lid to the pupil
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Right you don't want any of the top of the white of your eye showing that's that's
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That's freaky
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Surprised to talk to him for a long time about all the sort of trick to use to program the Furby to prompt
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kids to think of it
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As a living thing and he objected interesting Leah 1.2 thinking of it as a knot
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Exactly a living thing
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How is that
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Different than us wait a second toe are you really going to go all the way there
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:10,368	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Absolutely this is a toy with Servo Motors and things that move its eyelids
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	100 words
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So you're saying that life is a level of complexity
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,304	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If something is alive it's just more complex
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,120	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I think I'm saying that life is driven by the need to
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:21,632	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To be alive
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,168	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And by these base
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Animal feelings like pain and suffering I can code that
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I can code
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What do you mean you can code that anyone who write software and they do can say okay I need stay alive
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Therefore I'm going to come up with ways to
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To stay alive going to do it in a way that's very human I'm going to do it
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,600	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We can mimic these things by saying that he is my name
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This feeling of fear it's not the same thing as being
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Scared it's not feeling scared
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It is
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How is Zeus
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:55,936	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Began to a rather long back and forth would you say a cockroach is alive
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	About like what is the exact definition of life where is that Limekiln people machines but
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When we came back to Freedom food it got me started on this
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,688	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Spin Interac
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She says we're really stuck with her
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is that that little toy as simple as it is
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can have such a profound effect
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	On a human being one thing that was really fascinating to me was my husband and I gave
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A Furby as a gift
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	2
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Grandmother who had Alzheimer's
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,216	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Loved it
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Everyday for her was kind of knew and
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Somewhat disorienting but she had this cute little toy that
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kiss me
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,016	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I love you and she thought it was the most
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Delightful thing and its little beak with
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Covered with lipstick
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because she would
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Pick it up and kiss it everyday and
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She didn't actually have a long-term relationship with it
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For her it was always a short-term interaction
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:02,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So this is what I'm describing as a kind of thinness for her was was just right because that's what she was
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:02,752	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Capable of
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hello hello
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hey Caleb hey Caleb it's Dad hey Dad how are you I am fabulous
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feels Like Only Yesterday we were talking about
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:24,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Dissentients of the Furby
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:31,168	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So we brought Caleb back into the studio because in the years since we spoke with him he's worked on a lot of these
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Animatronic toys including a famous one called the pleo
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:38,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And in the process has been thinking a lot about how these toys can push our button
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As humans
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And how
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:43,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As a toy maker that means he's got to be
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Really thoughtful about how use that and worked when a baby doll
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Right now we done one
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And where and the baby doll and animatronic baby doll is this
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Probably the hardest thing to do
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because you know you do one thing wrong it's Chucky
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Link to slow if their eyes are too wide and also you're giving it the most
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Vulnerable of our species which is our young were
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Practicing being nurturing moms for their kids
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So let's say the baby just falls asleep right
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We're trying to write in this kind of code
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stop so you've just
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Give give the baby a bottle and you put it down to take a nap
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Turn down the quiet
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And so what I want to do as the baby falls asleep it goes into a deeper sleep but if you bump it right after it lays down
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then it wakes back up
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,584	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We're trying to write in this kind of code
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cuz that seems like a nice way
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To reinforce
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Best practices for Mommy right
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I know my responsibilities
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In this
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A large party says because he hasn't always gotten
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And it right here there's a great example
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His name is
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Leo
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,576	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That's him
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't know if you've ever seen the pleo dino we did
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Artificial intelligence
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cleo was a robotic dinosaur pretty small
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Barefoot from nose to tail look a lot like the dinosaur little foot from the movie Land Before Time
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:09,216	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Very cute very lifelike
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And we went hog-wild in and putting real emotions in it and
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Reactions
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The fear and everything right it is quite a step forward
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:22,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is it makes
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The Furby
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Looks like Child's Play
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Got the two microphones built in cameras to
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Track and recognize you
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Faceit can
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feel the beat of a song
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then with
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Dozens of Motors in it it condemned dance along to that song in total there are 40 sensors in this toy
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's so it it follows you around
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:47,872	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wanting you to pet it
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As you're petting it will fall asleep
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It is undeniably
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Adorable
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Caleb says his intent from the beginning was
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:04,000	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Very simple to create a toy that would encourage you
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To show love
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:06,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And caring
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,096	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In our belief is it
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Be more human than we think we can
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cut that out by having
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All creatures that you can love me
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That was Caleb demonstrating the pleo at a TED Talk
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And what's interesting is it in keeping with this idea wanting to encourage empathy
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Key programmed in some behaviors into the pleo
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:30,624	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That he hoped would nudge people in the right direction
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For example pleio will let you know if you do something that it doesn't like so if you actually moved his leg when his mother was moving a
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,608	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And he would interpret that has pain
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Or abuse
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:44,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And he would limp around and he would cry
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then he trembled and then he would take a while before he warmed up to you again
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,080	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And so what happened is
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:51,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We launched this thing
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And there's a website called device
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,968	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is sort of a tech product review website
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,248	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They got a hold of a pleo
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And they put up a video
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,904	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What you seen the videos pleo on a table
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Being beat
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:14,912	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You don't see who's doing it exactly you just see Hands coming in from out of the frame and knocking him over
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Again and again
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You see the toys legs in the air struggling to that
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:22,080	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Right itself
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They're like a turtle that's trying to get off
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,576	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And it started crying
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cuz that's what it does
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:40,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	These guys start holding upside down by its tail
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hail
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They smash its head into the table a few times
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you can see in the video that it responds
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like it's been stunned
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stumbling around
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	At one point they even start strangling
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It actually starts to choke
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Finally they pick it up by its tail one more time
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hellobyte sale
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And hit it and it was crying and then started screaming in a
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They beat it
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,688	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Until it died
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Write well
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Until it just did not work anymore
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This video was viewed about a hundred thousand times many more times than the
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Reviews
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The Cleo in Caleb says there's something about the city
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can't shake
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Whether it's alive or not that's
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That's exhibiting sociopathic Behavior
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He's not sure what brought out that sociopath
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Behavior whether there was some design in the toy
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:00,128	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Whether offering people
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Are there chance to see a toy in pain in this way somehow
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,480	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Brought out
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Curiosity
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I kind of cruel curiosity he's just not sure
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What happens when you turn ear and animatronic baby upside down will it cry
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm not sure yet I mean we're working on next versions right now right
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What would you do I mean it's a good question
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You have to have some kind of response otherwise it seems
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Broken right
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But you know if you make him react at all
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Going to get that repetitive abuse because it's
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:34,944	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Cool to watch
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Extreme
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:40,064	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It sounds like you have maybe an inner conflict about this shirt that you might even be pulling back
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:40,832	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Jamaica
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:44,672	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Extra life like yeah I'm I'm for my little company I have
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I've adopted kind of a hypocrite
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,000	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hippocratic Oath like
EDL	00:36:48,000	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Don't teach something that's wrong
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:53,376	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Or don't reinforce something is wrong
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And so I've been working on this problem for years
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:37:00,032	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm struggling with what's this what's the right thing to do
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Since you have the
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Power
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Since you have the ability
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To turn on and off chemicals at some level in another human
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:14,368	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Which ones do you choose
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And so this gets the bigger question of AI
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Write this is the question in AI
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm going to jump to this cuz it's really the same question is
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know how do we
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Create things that can help us
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know I'm dealing that on a microscopic
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:32,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Scale but this is the question
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:33,824	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And so
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The first thing that I would try to teach our new AI
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If I had the ability is
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Try to understand the concept of empathy
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We need to introduce the idea of empathy
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Both in an AI and us
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For these things
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That's
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:52,000	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where we're at
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:03,264	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Caleb says in the specific case of the of the animatronic babies designing
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:07,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	At least we talked to his thinking was that he might have it
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:11,200	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He holds it upside down cry once or twice but then stop
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:13,504	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So that you don't get that
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Repeat thrill
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I was wondering whether
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Back in the grid space with Brian Christian and Beck on the subject
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chatbot
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:34,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We found ourselves asking the very question that
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:34,752	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Calebasse
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is it possible that
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is getting kind of grim
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,360	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That maybe
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then some
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In some ways tripods are good for humans yeah means there any situation where you can throw in a couple of pots and things get better
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:49,600	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What can chatbots actually be helpful
EDL	00:38:49,600	00:38:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	For us and if so
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,160	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah there have been some academic studies on trying to use
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chatbots for these
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is Humane
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:58,560	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Benevolent
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,352	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That I think
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:01,376	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Type this in
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:01,888	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Interesting
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Other narrative
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,704	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I am so for example
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:06,240	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Researchers have
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tried injecting chatbots into
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Twitter
EDL	00:39:11,104	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And the spot will just show up and be like
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And does it just like that
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know it'll say something like they're real people behind the keyboard and you're really hurting someone's
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you know it's sort of preliminary work but there are some studies that appear to see
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Suggest yunnan
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,008	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sharp decline in that users use
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hate speech
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,224	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	FCI of 50 trillion followers
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Oh yeah it actually does depends that isn't
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It does depend on the follower count
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Of the bot that makes the intervention
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So if you perceive this bought
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To be
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It also requires that you think are person so this
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is it started flirting with it with dark magic
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But if you perceive them to be
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Higher status on the platform
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then yourself
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:12,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then you will
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tntap sheepishly fall in line
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,128	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But if the bottom
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Has fewer followers than the user is trying to
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:18,944	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Correct
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That will just instigate the
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,528	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The bully to believe them
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,296	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Now in addition
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wow
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Human Nature
EDL	00:40:29,696	00:40:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Very cool thing I ever going to finish but this is like this is the
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All right so I'm going to tell you one more story because as we were thinking about all this and trying to find a more optimistic place to live
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	We bumped into a story
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:43,776	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	From this guy
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who are you
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I'm I'm a Josh Rothman I'm a writer for the New Yorker
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,272	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Run into the studio couple weeks back
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who's this
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:59,392	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Story of yours large it takes
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Place in a laboratory
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In Barcelona at the lab it's in Barcelona and it's run by a couple minutes later and mavi son
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Chess Vives Vives neuroscientist
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:13,728	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They have these two VR Labs together
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	VR as in virtual reality
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,080	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And Josh took a trip
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The Barcelona
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:21,920	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To experience some of the simulations that Navien melt
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,712	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wet
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,992	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Campusship
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,552	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Their lab you feel sort of like you're going to a Black Box Theatre
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's sort of like a lot of big rooms
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	All covered in black with curtains
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:37,792	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	There's a lot of dark spaces and explain the what's going to happen is going to put on a headset
EDL	00:41:37,792	00:41:44,192	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is there a big helmet and eventually
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:44,960	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Peterson
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The visual start
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,544	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Fade in
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,336	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This room
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Appears you're standing in a sort of generic room the graphics look straight out of like a Windows 95
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Computer game is like the loading screen of the VR
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then
EDL	00:42:03,135	00:42:03,903	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That dissolves
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then it's replaced with the simulation
EDL	00:42:08,767	00:42:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And when the simulation started
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:14,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I was standing in front of a mirror a digital mirror in this digital world
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Reflecting back at him his digital self
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is Avatar
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So basically you move and your beautiful body moves with you I could see in the mirror
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A reflection of myself but the person who's who
EDL	00:42:28,991	00:42:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The self thought I saw a reflected
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She had a body through the woman
EDL	00:42:33,087	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I think when people think of virtual reality they often imagine
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wanted to have like realistic experiences
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	NVR
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But that's not what melon mommy do
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They are interested in VR precisely cuz it lets you experience things you could never experience in your real body in the
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Real world that body that can be completely transformed and Campbell fan contains coloring
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Change shape
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So it's can give you a very very
EDL	00:43:02,271	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Unique
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tool to wax
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:09,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Explorer in their work they'll often in Industry our world turn men and women as they did for Josh for his
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His first timeout
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They will
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How to take a tall person and then make them a short person
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In the VR
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So that they can experience the world as a short person
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Crane their neck up a bunch
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They'll change the color of your skin NPR end
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Run you through scenarios where you are having to experience the world as another race
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And what's remarkable is it in all of these manipulations
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Apparently you adjust to the new body
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,087	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Very quickly
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They've done physiological tests
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Measure this
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It takes almost no time at all to
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feel as if this alien body is actually yours they call this the illusion of presence
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Ingleside water body
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I-70
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stable entity however
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	By running
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Experiments in virtual reality
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You see that's actually it in
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:00,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In one minute
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Elvis stimulation
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How are brain except a different body
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Even if this body is
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's quite different from your own
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And this flexibility that our brains seem to have
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,719	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Can lead to some very
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:15,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Surreal
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Situations
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is really a story that brought us to ja she told us
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	About another VR Adventure where again he put on the headset
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This world fade it up
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I was sitting in a chair
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In front of a desk
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:29,311	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In a
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Really cool looking modernist house
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wooden floor sanding there is
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:38,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Some glass walls and through glass walls
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Field with wildflowers
EDL	00:44:42,623	00:44:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Again he noticed a mirror and this time the reflection the mirror
EDL	00:44:45,951	00:44:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was of him
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It was a realistic-looking Avatar of him
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	After checking out his digital self for a while
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:53,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He turned his head back
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To the room and realized it across the room
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	There was another desk
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And behind this other desk with there was Freud
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who Freud
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:08,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Middle-aged man with a big brown beard and a beard
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He had glasses
EDL	00:45:10,527	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He was just sitting there with his hands folded in his lap
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Digicert taking this all and he's looking at
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Voice looking
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:18,207	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Back at him
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then okay now and now I use the voice of a researcher in his ear coming through his VR helmet
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,775	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She explained what you're going to do is
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:37,151	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You're going to explain a problem that you're having a personal problem that you're having to Freud
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Something that's bothering you in your life
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And she said
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:44,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Take a minute think about what you'd like to discuss
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Do something immediately jump to mind ya so
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know my my mom
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Had a stroke a few years ago
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And she's in a nursing home
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I'm her guardian
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	She's
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	65
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But because of the stroke she
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like needs 24-hour care and you can't talk
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Shouldn't have any words any
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's a very tough
EDL	00:46:07,359	00:46:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sing for me
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I thought really hard about where she
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You should live at why I live here in New York
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	My mom
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Lives in Virginia
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:20,671	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just as he really debated for a long time should he put her in a nursing home in New York
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Where he can be closer to her or
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:29,119	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Should he put her in a nursing home in Virginia or he would be far away she has all these friends and family members down there
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:30,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So in the end I decided
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:35,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know find a place for her there where there's lots of people who can visit
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I go down
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:37,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Maybe once every
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Month or six weeks
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Ecstasy my mom but then every weekend
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Someone from this
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Super Friends Are Family relatives visit
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Turn down there where the fuhrer. On video on the first
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,831	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Decision I made
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But you don't feel really happy then yeah you know I feel guilty about it
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like he was a terrible son
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:58,815	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And he said he would especially have that feeling each week after
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:03,935	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Her friends would visit her in the nursing home and then send him an email update saying hey this is how your mom is doing
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Every time he would read one of those emails
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Even if she was doing well his stomach which is
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:10,335	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Drop this problem this emotion
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feeling guilty
EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is 1
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,431	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Felt for a while
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:16,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So I said to Freud
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I said
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	My mom is in a nursing home in another state
EDL	00:47:23,647	00:47:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Friends and family visit her and they send me reports
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:30,815	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And how she's doing and I always feel really bad
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,351	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When I get these reports
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And this is said in your voice if you'd blakey's that the mirror while you were talking would you be saying it
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So after he said this
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:42,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To Freud the world sort of
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Beat It Out
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:45,151	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Two black
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then it faded back in
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:48,735	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And suddenly the world has shifted
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	NewsNow across the room
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Behind the desk that you just been opposite in
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:57,439	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He was inside the body of Freud you look down himself he's wearing white
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	White shirt grey suit
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	There's a mirror next to that desk me looks himself
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I have a little beard and everything looks just like Freud but the main thing that was really surprising was that a cross I could see myself
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So this is the Avatar of me now
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,055	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Washed myself
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Say what I just said so
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Oh well so it plays it back
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Exactly
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Dell recording is now replate
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Movements and also the voice
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And they see themselves
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As they talked about their problem
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The first I can see my I'm sitting in the chair and sort of uncomfortable
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm moving around
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:37,375	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I take my hands and
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,959	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Put them in my lap and fold them together and I take
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Come apart
EDL	00:48:42,239	00:48:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I can watch myself be nervous
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:47,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then I saw
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Then I saw myself say what I just said my mom is in a nursing
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Another state
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Friends and family visit
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Send me reports
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,343	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In my voice
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm going to moving the way I move in
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It was just like me watching myself
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I guess the best way
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I can describe that
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It was moving
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:15,775	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What movie
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Emotionally emotionally
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,151	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I felt
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:26,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But I don't know if this is going to make any sense but
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:30,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You know how there's a point in your life where you realize that your parents are just people
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,927	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah it was kind of like that
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is upset with me
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did you feel closer to that guy or or I felt bad
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:41,887	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He felt bad for him
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Sorry
EDL	00:49:43,167	00:49:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yeah I did I fry my my feelings went out
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:47,007	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Up to this other person
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:47,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who is me
EDL	00:49:48,287	00:49:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	As he's having this empathetic reaction as Freud
EDL	00:49:51,359	00:49:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Looking back at himself
EDL	00:49:52,383	00:49:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The researchers voice again appears in his ear
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:56,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If advice
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	From the perspective of Sigmund Freud
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Advice of Hardee's
EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Problem could be solved how you could deal with it essentially respond to your patient
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't know what to say so I said
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why do you think you feel bad
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What's a good pretty
EDL	00:50:16,959	00:50:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why do you think you feel bad
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Soon as he ask that
EDL	00:50:20,031	00:50:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He's back
EDL	00:50:20,799	00:50:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In his body is virtual body staring back at virtual Freud and he sees a playback of Freud asking him that question I watched
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Freud stages
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This to me why do you think you feel bad
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:31,807	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Except that when Freud talks they had some
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Thing in the program that made
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His voice
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Extra deep
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Mikasa
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Voice distortion
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:44,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	How deep are boys his voice didn't sound like my voice how did you respond as he has now you
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I said I feel bad
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because
EDL	00:50:47,167	00:50:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It doesn't seem right that I'm
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Looking for a way
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Once again
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He switches bodies now he's in Freud again staring back
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:50:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm self and I watched myself say this
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:50:59,199	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I feel bad
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:02,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then is Freud I said well why
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:04,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why are you far away then
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Shoot back into his own body
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,927	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Protecting from across the room why are you far away though
EDL	00:51:08,927	00:51:09,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I said well because
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If my mom lived in New York I'd be the only person here but
EDL	00:51:14,815	00:51:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If she's down
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And where she lives that there's other people to visit her
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:21,215	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That confronts potty
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I said so it sounds like there's there's a reason
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why I'm
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Why you live where you live
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:31,199	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I'm so if you know that won't hit why do you why do you still feel bad
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:34,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Switch is back to himself if you know they're white
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I said something like
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:43,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You're right
EDL	00:51:45,791	00:51:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Back at the front
EDL	00:51:47,583	00:51:50,399	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And then it's Friday I said you know it sounds like the
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	The thing that's making you unhappy which is
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Making you feel bad we're just getting used
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Reports from these people is actually the whole reason why you
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:00,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Decided
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To live and he's going to have to keep your mom where she is
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like there's a a loop
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Right it's like these these reports I get for my mom's
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Friends make me feel bad but the whole reason why
EDL	00:52:13,183	00:52:13,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Decided to leave her in this place in Virginia is specifically so that there are friends
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who can visit her
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is classic idea in psychology called the refrain which is where
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Giant take a problem and reframe that problem into its solution
EDL	00:52:28,031	00:52:29,823	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He says in that moment he kind of did that
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It is very simple Epiphany that
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	His guilt
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was actually connected to something good
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I never had that thought before
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He chose to keep his mom in Virginia so that her friends would visit her more in
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Each time her friends visited he felt bad
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That meant they were visiting
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:48,255	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To the bad feeling ineffective
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was feeling it so much
EDL	00:52:49,791	00:52:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was itself kind of evidence for the fact that he had made
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	If not the right decision
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	At least a decision that made sense
EDL	00:52:57,471	00:53:02,591	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Experience I had talking to myself as Freud was was nothing like the experience I had
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	In my own head
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Turning this issue over and over
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Buy sweet tea
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Back and forth
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Hey by swapping bodies
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Somehow you can give advice
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I am
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	American Best
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:17,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When I was back in my own body and Freud set it to me either
EDL	00:53:17,951	00:53:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Just like
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I just felt like gum
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Wow
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	It's so good point
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When your next 30 what the hell is going on here why am I able in this
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:32,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Utterly fictive situation
EDL	00:53:32,799	00:53:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Split myself in two and heal myself while I put the headset off
EDL	00:53:37,407	00:53:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I sat there for a little while while the
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:40,735	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Researchers
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Look at me
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Trying to make sense of it and I think what
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What I keep coming back to is the
EDL	00:53:50,207	00:53:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Seeing yourself just as a person
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:54,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Not as you
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Not with all the complexities and
EDL	00:53:58,399	00:53:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Stuff
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:54:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That is in you
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Yourself
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:02,495	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Experience of being yourself
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And this might be the real key thing like when you are in your body
EDL	00:54:06,847	00:54:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Would you pretty much always are
EDL	00:54:08,895	00:54:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You have all of these thoughts and feelings which are at
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Attached
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	To that body
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When you go home for Thanksgiving and you walk into your parents kitchen and suddenly you just
EDL	00:54:18,879	00:54:19,647	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kind of feel
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:21,951	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Like you're a teenager again
EDL	00:54:22,719	00:54:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I call those same thought patterns from your youth
EDL	00:54:25,279	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kind of kick back into gear
EDL	00:54:26,815	00:54:28,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Because the context
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	That kitchen
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is power
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And you your body
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is that writ large but if you can jump out of it go into a new one
EDL	00:54:37,311	00:54:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Suddenly all those constraints
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Penelec contact
EDL	00:54:40,895	00:54:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Is gone
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:42,943	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When I'm in body does
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:43,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Freud
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:44,991	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Not only do I look different
EDL	00:54:46,015	00:54:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	This is my body
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	But I feel different
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I have different types of thoughts
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And I see
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:53,695	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	People differently
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Josh says what he saw
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:58,047	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	What he was Freud looking back at himself
EDL	00:54:59,327	00:55:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Was just a guy who needed help
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	When someone comes to you and ask for help
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:04,703	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your feelings are not
EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	They're just
EDL	00:55:06,751	00:55:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tenderness
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Kindness
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Your instinct is to
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Help them
EDL	00:55:13,151	00:55:15,711	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	He says he's able to bring that very simple way of being
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Back to himself
EDL	00:55:18,015	00:55:19,039	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did it did it make a difference
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did you walk out of that with with a different
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feeling about yourself
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:24,671	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Did I think
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:27,487	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I've had a feeling of
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I think it revised my
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:30,815	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Feeling about
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:32,095	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Who I was
EDL	00:55:33,119	00:55:34,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I think it made me feel a little more
EDL	00:55:36,959	00:55:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	I don't even have a word for it
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	A little more human
EDL	00:55:54,879	00:55:58,463	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Joshua writer the New Yorker his story first appeared there
EDL	00:55:58,975	00:56:02,303	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	And we told it to that live audience at the Greene space
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	So Brian this is
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	You can get the last word
EDL	00:56:08,191	00:56:11,263	| radiolab_podcast18morelesshumanfix |	Tell me this is really interesting because the history of
