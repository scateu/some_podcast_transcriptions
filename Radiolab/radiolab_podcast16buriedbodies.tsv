EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So Saturday night July 28th 1973
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	For young people
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:52,128	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Go camping in the Adirondacks
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:55,968	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Pulled off the road beside Road off Route 30
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,528	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They made up a makeshift campsite
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Grass clearing they set up two times and went to sleep for the night
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And on Sunday that you know I woke up
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	About 9 a.m. campers

EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I'll suddenly heard the zipper
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the time go up and what they saw was as middle-aged man. Into the tent
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Look like a conservation officer he had a fedora with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle he had a buck knife
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Binoculars around his neck
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And very calmly he told them
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Almost politely to step out of their time which they did the other two campers
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You're all four of them rounded up together
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And they're kind of standing in a semicircle
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then the man cock the gun and said listen to I've killed before and I'll kill again
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm going to take your gas by don't want to get caught so I'm going to tell you the trees
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They started marching the kids off into the woods
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Took him into the woods near a brook in pairs a 2 with him behind them
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:03:01,760	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The kids of course were scared out of their wits by themselves
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You nosey pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So after we had the four people tied
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He went back to
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The first boy 18 year old fell down blue ski and the forest
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They couldn't really see what was happening because you're clearly
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I'm
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They heard vomiting sounds when they heard Phillips voice get really high and
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They knew something was happening something bad was happening to him what was happening with his buck knife
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Stop in 5 times in the chest and when this happened three of them and their Panic were able to break
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Loose and start running Nick fiorello ran to his car Carol and malinowski ran through the woods
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But the man caught one of them
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And he had them lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Supreme Inn in
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The killer laying in the ditch an hour
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The man command at the other two campers the ones we gotten away had managed to alert
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	All sudden they spotted them killer
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And Freeman
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:16,768	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the man screaming for help saying he
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He's got a gun he's going to shoot
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And a man with a gun
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Just kind of stood up
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Calmly and coolly walked into the forest
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And thus began
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What was at the time the largest man on State history state police cars parked almost
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Does far up the road as you can see when the Manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the State Police standing by
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It was a scene like a never been seen before up there
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Roving patrols man armed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Helicopters game right now like Monday or Tuesday they had 200 men on the case
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Out of the Woods eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	837 year old Robert Garrow Robert Francis Garrow Sr of Syracuse New York
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Looking forward today he was an ex-convict in prison for rape of 7 years
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Alpine with a 30-30 rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:30,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So by Tuesday people got panicked
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	People loaded the rifles they block the doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	People left the area so fast
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They left behind coolers on what happened with Carol was able to use those camps and
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:55,583	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That food in those drinks to survive about 400 men now
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The police
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Follow a lead that he had stolen the car and he had been sighted and they
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They're kind of closing in on him
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then the 12th Thursday August 9th 1973
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer officer named Hillary LeBlanc
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sparta Gyro
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He said freeze or drop your gun something to that effect
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And Carol started running
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	LeBlanc fire four times
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Got him in the back
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The arm in the foot
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Darrell went down once got back up and kept running chasing through the forest
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Distant very short time they saw Daryl and he was laying down in the mud
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Cuz he was just laying there
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But that you know I took his pulse and everything and he was certainly alive
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Put him in an ambulance and they rushed him to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and According to Jim a couple of
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Cops go with him
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They're going in the whole time because they think that you might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's Gone Missing
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But he wouldn't talk
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	At this point
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Did the story that I'm interested in really get started
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's known as the buried bodies case and I think one of the things
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So fascinating about the
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Case this is my professor Lisa Lerman use the conflict
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Between what a good lawyer should do

EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In the situation
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Required to the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani

EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And a lot of things are going to happen
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This is a year before the Manhunt
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	1972 Frank remembers he represented in
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	At first onto pretty small things
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A school teacher has a salted his child he was under the suit of school and I
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I talked him out of it
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:23,199	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then he had an automobile accident I represented my back
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But then
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Pretty quickly
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Dark Gyarados charged with trying to kidnap two college kids
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,927	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That case got dismissed but then
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Melissa see some young girl kids very young girls age 10 and 11 Guerra was released on bail
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He skipped his court date
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And just disappeared
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then we pick up where we left off
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The murder The Manhunt
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	An August 9th
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The night girl got captured
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Frank gets a call
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	From girls wife
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Telling me that you wanted to talk to me Armani to represent my impression is that Armani
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Didn't want to do it in my mind I'm saying what the hell do I want to get involved in this
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Go for it never handled a murder charge from murder case you didn't know
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How the problem was Gary wouldn't talk
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Any lawyer except for Armani attorney
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:22,591	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Eventually decides to go and talk to the judge you've been assigned to the case
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the judges basically like
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We have an obligation to provide the council
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That this guy wants
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So I mean unless you have a good reason why you can't do it
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I want to appoint you his public defender
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Anna Ronnie agrees
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And so at that point
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He has to defend Carol
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So this is reporter Jim Tracy again
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Together as friends or families picnic together to help them with this case
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	As co-counsel because I felt I needed support LG was the top criminal defense lawyers
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In central New York I need someone with brains and guts
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So our money goes to talk to belge
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I just need backup that's it has no money in it
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The prosecution had three eyeball Witnesses they had his car at the scene of the crime and they had his two-week flight he was
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Guilty and I said come on I'm not going to try to prove you didn't do it send
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Maybe girl murdered this kid maybe it was because he had temporarily gone insane
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm telling you about my Siri and have that Armani tells him
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We pulled this off a while but eventually
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm in
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Frank
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Now we're into late August 1973
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I got there they want a big girls room on the fifth floor of the hospital
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Police are standing guard
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They walked into the room
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I haven't seen them in a while
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We greeted each other and we talked
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And just a picture this
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Jim told me that the room they put garro in was what he described as a training observation room which meant that it had
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Does big window that ran alongside girls bed
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So they could keep an eye on it and the cops are stationed right outside
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,167	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Just
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Watching
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And According to Jim and I should save her different accounts about this but apparently the cops had brought in a lip read
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To try to see what year was saying I don't think you can do that
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That's not legal I think that's
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Probably not okay but from the cops perspective they think that he's involved in recent merch
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Murder and missing girl
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And they think that girl could still be alive
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,815	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So they want to know
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	2 solving that murder and finding that girl
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But at the same time the defendant has to be able to share absolutely everything with the lawyers and know that there
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In that safe space of that relationship because we have
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Not to incriminate oneself
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Free meet speakers attorney
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Then we have no real Justice sister Army and LG
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They need as much information about what Gareth has done as they possibly can get so they can start to build
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Their defense
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I don't like surprises
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm the kind that wants to know everything
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Wow so so what that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He needed to get from Garrow his story and it needed to be just that me didn't want the cops in on it yet
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:48,927	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Don't know if there is TAPS in the room or what so they're turn up the TV turn up the fans but
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:53,279	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He was playing games so he talked basically about anything but
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But the cases
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Kept saying he couldn't remember you couldn't remember and they're they're trying to convince him like
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot Lynch Mob out there
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:07,103	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	There's Witnesses in Cairo new
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe 25 to life and pedophile in prison
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Careful things and get rough
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,343	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But they tell him if you talk to us
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Only defense to help get Garrow into a mental hospital instead of a prison that was the Galt
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	If you have anything to say
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Took several conversations to get Garrett at this point
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But finally
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Portosol out
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	At this point it was just belge in the room
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I told him
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yes he had killed them booski
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And it also killed other people too and the episodes
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When Garrow kills people seem to have
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I followed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And you know become psychotic and do horrible things
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When it came to the details keep tended to not remember but then
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,567	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Girl mentions two particular girls who were then missing
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And his parents had no idea where they were twenty-one-year-old Susan pads and another girl 16 year old Alicia Hawk
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan pets
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Bus from Chicago she's a girl I mentioned earlier cops were already looking for her hoping that girl might have some information
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Earlier that summer
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them have been camping and Susan have been gone ever since
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Alicia Hauck
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She's a high school girl from Syracuse
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She gone missing just a couple of days before Susan
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Everybody thought
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She might have just run away
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But Garrett told the lawyers
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,735	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That he had killed them and where he had left their body
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	One odd thing about the arrows
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,623	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Description of the incidence
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He doesn't say I killed her
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He says
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She got stabbed with my knife
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She got stabbed with my knife
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Like it wasn't even him doing the stabbing right
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Like this is
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is this
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:17,407	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	True you know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A dream he had it could be a delusion if you're going to go and
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know craft an argument and in
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,903	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Preventive strategy you need to know
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What actually happened
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Don't you walk out the door
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He grabs Frank and he says let's go
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So they they sleep outside
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,351	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I get in the car
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We take off to go look for the bodies
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:48,383	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Caro told lawyers that Susan pets was in an air vent of a
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Close-up Mineshaft
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The mine is up in Mineville an hour south of the hospital
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Are you scared are you excited like
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:09,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You scared you're concerned yet fear you're a fool if you don't
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In the rearview mirror they got a little spooked State Police
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So eventually they pull over get out of the car
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Went into one bar where one of Francis belge
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Lady friends
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What's hanging out
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We're about 30 minutes build you talk to her then asked if he could borrow her car
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Door
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Took off driving the lady friends cartoon
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Until they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Here as far as we're going to go
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,311	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Okay we can walk
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Up to this old abandoned mine
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:02,367	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Went out there last February with reporter Laura mckinstry and
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The town supervisor of Mariah TomSka the father
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So this is a road that goes to the mines or what is
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Jamberry I see that day
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This hair
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This used to be in Allroad 1
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We're walking up a very wooded
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Hill
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Fairly steep ever no leaves
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And all the trees were
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Black and Clarice Calico
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The only way they could have came in here
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Here we are in
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Our Sunday suits
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And here we go trudging through the
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Forest
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Looking for the key
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Respect
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Notable Works looking around
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We found this
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What are vent
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You see the airshaft here they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Couple feet across
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That shoots up from
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Down in the depths of the Mind be careful that this is giving me such
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yeah you don't want to slide down in there
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And so they couldn't see anything
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Down the hole
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So Frank Armani lay down on the ground at the
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The edge of The Mineshaft got a flashlight that he takes out my feet
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,903	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And let me down in there
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And as Frank got lower down into the hole
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I could see her snake
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The blue shoe
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A blue
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sneaker
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Bandana leg
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,823	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I said to myself this son of a b**** did it
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And yells back up to bail to get out of here
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Put me back up
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Eventually belge found the other body
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,903	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Alicia house party
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Choosing a cemetery where Garrow had said he'd left her
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But Armani wasn't there when told you found
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So what ensued
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Was a very long struggle
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Where the Warriors
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Try to figure out what to do with the information about
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The bodies of these girls
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,175	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So what's the other play that out what
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,199	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What are your options
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sure so option1 we've got to call the police
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We've got to tell the prosecutor
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	These are missing kids
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We're the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No you can't
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You just can't
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We took her know to keep the confidences of a client under the current rules
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Which app developed quite a bit since
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The time is 7
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Anything that is related to the representation of a client
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is under the confidentiality umbrella
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You're not supposed to
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Tell anybody
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Step to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That will be
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That is it can be or will be
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Right so
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:25,120	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So in this situation the two girls are dead
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Then there's no future crime it's over
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's done
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,520	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And even if
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The parents of the missing girls in question
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:39,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But there's no ifs IFS
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	People are already dead then you do the lawyers
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That's right
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Have a very particular part to play you you have a roll
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,984	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And that roll
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Isn't what you think as a person is
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member that situation what your role is
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is today
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Play the part of a system in which you're the one
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,064	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Who stands up for the guy that everybody else
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Hates
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Even if
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Everybody hates you even if
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To do your job and that job is to be in the role of the person
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,888	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That fights as hard as they can for their client
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The lawyer is
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The agent of his client
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Only only the agent or Contour also a citizen and a member of the part of the justice system in

EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Okay hey I'm Jared I'm Rod I'm Robert krulwich
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This is Radiolab
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:11,520	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And no
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Get back to our story from producer Brenna Farrell
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When we left it there where they were stock right
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Need it with a new this thing believe the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Two girls
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Now
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What's their next move
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Well
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So they decide to
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:28,928	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Plea bargain
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The take this information to the prosecutor and
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Say I have information that will help you solve some cases
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Some cases yes
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:40,448	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And in exchange I want you to give me
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A better day
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Get Garrow into a mental off
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Instead of a prism
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Oh so right away they're going to use this as Leverage
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That was
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The idea
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:57,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You going to give a little and you're going to take a little while that's kind of gross no yeah he's trying to get a better deal
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	For this
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Murderer but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He's got this information
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:09,888	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	As a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea Bargains then that's a way for him to get some clothes
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Lawyer for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So crazy again
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I called a meeting with Henry McCabe from the state police
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the district attorney at armories office
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When they met
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Army Belgian search the briefcases of the VA in the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Because they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:38,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then bailed you presents
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off to prison
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the prosecutor apparently very quickly puts two and two together and then immediately thought
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Holy s*** are you talking about Susan and Alicia like these are the two girls that we are
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:59,552	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Most concerned about we think they're alive
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And belge said I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Both the VA in the investigator. That the lawyers were absolutely ludicrous
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They thought they lost her mind get a better sentence for a murderer by offer
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:18,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is murder victims Are you seriously bargaining with people's lives
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yeah but also I'm sure that the prosecutor do
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That this was doubtless
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The highest-profile case
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That would ever come to him and so as the prosecutor you're not going to look so good if you give a deal to this
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Reprehensible man
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Know well what the hell's the difference is you gonna get life
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,024	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No matter what
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:47,424	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How many times you want to give him life but the meeting only lasted like 5 minutes
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Collapses completely to back up a little ways
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That was particularly devastating for Armani because just the day before
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan Pat's father flown in from Chicago
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:02,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To Syracuse I remember mr. pets
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Coming to my office
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Any side can I meet with you and talk to yuan
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	An Armani agreed to it so he comes in
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Takes a seat from father to father is there anything you can tell me about my daughter I mean
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:15,840	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The papers
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Think that that Daryl probably has something to do with her disappearance is there anything at all
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,008	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That he's told you that that can help me
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I couldn't tell him anything they can't tell you there's nothing I can tell you
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Remember trying to
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Assure him that
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I've got a meeting set up
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	All I can say is it's what state investigators
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The prosecutor on the case
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,672	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They could have some information
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Trying to
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Give them hope
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We will bring it to a conclusion
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I thought we would
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But we did
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So then when Mr pets leaves Mr Armani
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Elisabeth
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He threw a bunch of books
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We got through the phone basically just you know destroyed his office
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Just trying to relieve
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That I couldn't help the man because he's looking right at this man knowing exactly
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Imagine what he's going through like Armani had lost
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A brother
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Was much younger
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is 4 years younger than
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is an Airforce pilot
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,376	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And in 1962
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,912	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Plane went down and he was lost at sea
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So after that Armani said his mother
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:32,896	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Cheerleading
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know she couldn't
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Ever recover from it
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Because you can't you know you just
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,136	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You don't really know but you know
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I can understand that
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And that's
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know that's partly why this was so hard for her money because
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When that plea deal fell apart that
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Was his
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Chance to try to get this information to
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The family
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:04,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When's The Plea fell through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he was stuck
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What's up
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that Armani and Dolce have to knuckle down
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I tried to present an insanity defense
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Armani he said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,072	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Running down your back
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:26,912	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Go sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee and is waiting for the morning paper to come
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Because he was just alone with that he was
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Alone with the secret
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And he knew
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That moment the police are
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Trying to find these
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You're questioning yourself
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Very young
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,160	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You're hurting people
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Tell you begin to wonder am I in the right profession
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:54,048	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know you're looking for a
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,120	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You're looking for a way to give
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The information on
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:02,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know Monica synonymous call
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sure

EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	If I'm going to do it I want to do it openly yeah
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I don't know
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Did he ever
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Fever break
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But according to him know my mind
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I was doing what I thought was the proper
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Ethical legal moral
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Moral
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Thing
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Tutu
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:33,984	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In December of 1973
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	5 months after the girls disappear
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Their bodies happened to be discovered
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Within two weeks of each other
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:48,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan's body is discovered by two kids were playing up in the mines Alicia I guess I think a student from
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Syracuse University which is right next door to the
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Cemetery is walking through an instant balls upon her until she's discovered then to
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then six months later summer of 1974
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Even though
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:10,080	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Robert quiroz trial for the murder of the blue ski begins
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Apparently beaten Not Guilty by reason of insanity
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Turn order to make that case what they decide to do is is to put Guerra on the stand
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And Carol would tell his whole life story to shock the jury's mind including all these murders and
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:29,792	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Police rapes to see that he was at the time he was not

EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,400	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The trial opens
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The courtroom is jam-packed
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:45,152	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Prosecution starts they have really good case that got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton

EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:46,944	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then it's
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,224	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The time for the defense
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To start their case
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Te Velde stands up and he calls his first Witness

EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Girl gets on stand and he
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Starts telling his life story and it's
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Horrible
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Severe beatings and abuse by parents
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Girl education you basically gets

EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then

EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A series of rapes

EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And what happens next
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Nobody's quite sure if it was a slip-up or maybe it was on purpose but when garrow's talking about Sue

EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:55,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Paris
EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:57,504	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That was the worst moment of my life
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Awesome horrible thought
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I had some more
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	June 27th
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Robert Garrow is convicted for the murder of philip domblewski
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He's given the maximum sentence he's given 25 years to life
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In a maximum-security prison
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How did how did that feel
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:19,008	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Free relief
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yeah you know
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:22,080	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's over what
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But then it is up to the grand jury at self in their investigation to determine which charges
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Green against the
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:33,344	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Pretty soon after the verdict Armani and bailed you learn that they could be facing criminal charges
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tempering with evidence
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,000	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Obstruction of justice or
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:41,792	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	State public health law
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:44,352	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the provision that says that the body must be given
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,888	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Quick and decent burial
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And on top of that
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Greatest amount of controversy is the one over the attorney-client privilege
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:58,432	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	There was an ethical complaint filed against Armani and belge so basically they were then facing disbarment
EDL	00:34:58,944	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	An investigation into the ethical complaint
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That would drag on several years
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:07,904	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	LG started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Armani talked it out but he suffered no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What else can I do
EDL	00:35:16,608	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To make a living
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	He was just
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:24,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Barely getting by for a little while I think of all the stress and pressure
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Takes its toll
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:28,896	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In fact he has a heart attack
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Well this is all going on
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,480	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But eventually
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:36,064	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:36,832	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is the Smith
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And the reason in a
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Opinion of the court and the the State Bar is it Belgian or money did
EDL	00:35:44,000	00:35:44,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Was right
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What they did was good
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,072	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Exactly
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:52,704	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	According to the law and my view is Frank Armani
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You know real life
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Shiro
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,312	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I would say you know people
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So admire Atticus Finch in the difference between
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Atticus Finch and Frank Armani
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is that Armani is real person
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Eliza told me about this panel she organized back in 2007
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:14,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What is for the American Bar Association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about 400 people in the
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:16,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The room most of them lawyers
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They were there to watch
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,560	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	On stage
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The featured speaker Frank Armani
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,144	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And it was love
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What is this what is that feel like in did you ever think you'd
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:27,264	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Get to that point
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When you were in the midst of the hardest parts
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Never dreamed
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:39,040	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I don't think I was a hero I just was a lawyer that did his job
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I mean
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I was a good lawyer
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,000	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	At least I thought so I everybody
EDL	00:36:48,512	00:36:51,584	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And now it over 40 years later
EDL	00:36:51,584	00:36:55,936	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This case let's talk about and what Armani and belge did
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,960	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Dead bodies case
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Staton law schools across the country everybody
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:04,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Teaches the case it's like a touchstone
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What it what is
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:12,064	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	People say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Dance class here in New York that was being taught at 4.
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I agree his duties to his client he represents
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	His clients
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Interest
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Stiff and then sitting in on his classes and in talking to law professors
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I think one of the reasons that
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:30,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That this case is hot so widely is because
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Professors can point that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And say in this situation
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:40,992	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This is what a lawyer should do
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:45,088	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This is what a lawyer should
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Should be
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	From the moment I started thinking about this story
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I always wanted to talk to the
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Families involved which
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:01,728	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Proved really difficult
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,288	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Wrote letters
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:06,848	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To both families and I made a bunch of phone calls
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And understandably no one wanted to talk to me
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,712	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But eventually
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I did Tsar corresponding
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	With a family member of one of the
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:15,808	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Victims
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:21,184	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And after Fue
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:22,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Phone calls
EDL	00:38:22,976	00:38:29,120	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	With me on the phone call
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,192	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Would you mind
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Telling us who you are
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,520	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Your name in
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Occasion
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,104	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Okay I'm I'm Roberta pets
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:40,896	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Mother
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,968	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan was the girl from Chicago
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She's a college student who died
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,088	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	End
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:51,648	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Shih Tzu Armani and algae found in the mine
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	As I've explained before my interest really
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:38:59,072	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In the story of has to do with the fact that it seems that
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,864	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That it's become
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:05,728	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Classes talk about the concept of confidentiality
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And so I sort of wanted to just
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Start
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:14,944	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	With that idea to ask if that's something that you knew that law schools are teaching and and
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:16,736	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	If you had any feelings or thoughts of
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:20,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I had no idea that this was being taught in law school
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:23,904	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I'm pretty horrified to think that
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	This is what
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Is considered to be
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Correct
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Cuz I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught at the right way
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:34,400	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To do things
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In an ethical classes
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Totally incomprehensible
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And was the first that you'd heard that it wasn't out when I have reached out to you it was
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	In talking to you that I know that yet
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Maybe they Odyssey
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,392	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But what about the victim
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I think that that should at least be
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,768	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	An equal thought nevermind
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	If not
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	A greater consideration
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:05,888	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Did it did you have a feeling
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Did that you really weren't taking into consideration as as all of this was happening
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,288	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Yes
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,056	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Only
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	My husband and I when we first heard that she was missing
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,920	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We flew
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:19,456	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Immediately in
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,040	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Went to the police station and
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	When we were there
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:25,344	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sitting
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:26,112	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	With the police
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,304	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	My daughter's boyfriend
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:36,352	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What his body was found
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:38,144	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And that's that
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	All we knew and we never really had any updates
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:47,104	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Nobody told us what was going on and
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,408	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Obviously there was no closure and it was just
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,200	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Getting worse and worse
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And then the only other time we were contacted by the police
EDL	00:40:56,320	00:40:58,880	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Read some Authority I can't even remember who
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:03,744	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Was when her body my daughter's body was found like 5 months later
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:08,096	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And in the meantime of course we were all going crazy Mike
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,144	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	My father is a matter of fact
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:13,216	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Even went so far as to contact the cycle
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,496	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That's how
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:19,872	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How important it was and how it was our entire life during that period
EDL	00:41:20,384	00:41:21,920	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And as far as
EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:24,224	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Visiting the lawyer which my husband did
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It was a total lie lie
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:27,552	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	The lawyer
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And causing us more months
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:36,768	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Abhor
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:41,376	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And this is what is being taught in law school
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So anyway
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Just to try to be third ever involved
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	As far as I've
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:51,360	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Encountered anyone
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:57,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	By law professors law students there when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:00,575	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	They are struggling with the pain that I think the
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:05,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How could
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:09,023	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:10,303	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And so I guess that's
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:12,863	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That's why I was hoping to talk to you too kind of
EDL	00:42:12,863	00:42:14,655	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Let you have a chance to
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,447	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Communicate some of that
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Experience
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,567	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How to really communicate in words
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:25,407	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I mean 40 years later I'm still
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I like it and it's soda struggle to
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Disgusting
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Because
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	You'll never go away as long as I live
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,903	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I don't know I guess
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:38,975	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Wondering
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:42,047	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We've been talking a lot of
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:45,887	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Bad stuff and wondering if there's anything you would like to say about
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Susan that the doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,031	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That you want to share I don't
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:52,799	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Nothing you don't have to
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,103	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Well
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:57,919	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What can I say she was
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,503	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	She did receive her degree posthumously
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	We we didn't go and pick it up at
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Boston University
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,183	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Difficult for us
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And Danny who is her boyfriend had been just that summer
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And he had a full scholarship
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:23,263	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Andrea graduated just a year before and
EDL	00:43:24,031	00:43:25,055	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	So true life
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	And I'm sure the other two children him
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,175	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Great futures
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,199	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I haven't been true
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:34,527	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's just a horrible tragedy
EDL	00:43:48,095	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	It's so
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:51,679	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Horrible
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:54,495	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To be in their position
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:58,591	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Do I have to live through that
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I mean
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,663	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	How do you relate Lucina tartar
EDL	00:44:02,943	00:44:05,247	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm worried what excuse is there for
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	To protecting the person to kill her
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:13,951	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	No justification you can justify it in my mind
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:18,303	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I don't expect them to accept it
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:20,095	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	But
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,399	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	That's the way it is
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,215	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I'm going to get just a minute of
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:58,751	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Silence up here if it's okay
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:19,743	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I can hear this
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:23,839	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Echoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up to
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,399	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	What the hell is going to bounce around
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Water I think it's
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	From deeper down in there dripping I can't tell
EDL	00:45:32,031	00:45:33,567	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Where is ripping everything up here is
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:34,847	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Frozen solid
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,359	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	Sure what that is
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:38,175	| radiolab_podcast16buriedbodies |	I think I'm going to turn back around
