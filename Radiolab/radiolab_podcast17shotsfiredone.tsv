EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:05,280	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	American Teenager was shot and killed when that became a national story
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	There was a lot of bellyaching in the Press
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Each year I know one keeps accurate statistics statistics on
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,504	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And it struck me at the time that liked what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in awhile one of these things will catch fire
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,440	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Fire
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Sam Dubose in the story and I personally was having
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Processing that like
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Number one
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,680	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is there
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is it trending
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	One way or the other
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Are police shooting more black people than white people
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Just very simple
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,128	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The problem is
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,152	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	We don't know
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:56,992	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	We have no idea because nobody traxys FBI doesn't state agency
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	For the most part I said that. That doesn't exist somewhere within the police find itself in the police department does
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	On the local level
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	However
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It doesn't exist in any Accurate Way
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'll buy a broader agency
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I can tell you how many
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:18,240	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Purse snatchings there were in Florida 2011 using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for Department of Law Enforcement
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I can't tell you how many times please
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Shots
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:29,248	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Incomplete
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Yeah cuz most of those
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:32,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Yell at the guardian has an online database
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Most of them rely on media reports they're only really keeping track of the ones that serve hit the public consciousness
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That's right
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So Ben and his editors
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	. let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	First study guide
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:55,104	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Florida is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public record
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Legally it's easier to get information Florida then and a lot of other places that sell
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Events at down insert emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	88 emails
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	5 years
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Or killed as a result of that shooting.
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	This involves a year of work County Police Department's getting lawyers involved this is a massive thing that evolved
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Probably no less than a hundred people but
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Eventually
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,224	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Been put together
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,296	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The most comprehensive police shooting database
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That we know of
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Richard Matt
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Barbecue Center producer Matt kielty down to the Tampa Bay Times
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,256	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I was just in right here
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	To check it out how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stairs and it's probably 5,000 pages
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Add a stack of paper that
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	About as tall as me
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	6 we talked we got a broken down by County but you can see
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So a b Bay County
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Boca Raton
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Boynton Beach
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Do the alphabet manila folders with tons of papers and then spread
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Craftsman Tire desk
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The combination of
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Use-of-force reports civil court records
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And media clippings the represents

EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Shootings
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I hope every shooting in the State of Florida pain in 6 years time
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	2009 to 2014
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Toys R Us
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Go through all of this material
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Scrapy each of those reports for every
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Bit of information that we could
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Yet that we thought was useful
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Circumstantial stuff did involving SWAT team
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Didn't involve an armed suspect was there Chase
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:50,559	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	All the demographic information for the firing officer or officers and the
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	People are hit by those bullets
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,607	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Then we thought
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Let's like learn from these let's see how
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	How we can compile the data and build a database and
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Hopefully Draw Something
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Conclusions lessons some
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Solutions
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	This is all going to go into it server giant online database
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Tampa Bay Times website
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Hopefully other
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	In the meantime
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Do some of the things have been founded initially some of it you know country priceless
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Well the biggest sword
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Counterintuitive
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Line in this the numbers are flat
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	He says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	After year the numbers of states that a
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	About a hundred thirty people shot by police
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:44,319	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Every year which seems odd cuz you know the past couple years B's videos that go viral
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Makes it seem like this is a
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I knew an intense
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Problem
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	We also broke these down into categories
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Because you know what you see like on the most basic level are there
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	About a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Quote mentally unstable this is a case we're not taking to guess
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	There's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill maybe off their meds time of the shooting
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Allegory Ben says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Hot
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Which is which somebody who's usually
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Mentally ill
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Apparently trying to
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Standing on the porch standing behind the screen door
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And raises a weapon tour
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,775	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It's either weapon or or what they
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I want the police to
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Think his weapon
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	To me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	If you will cover police apparently know quite well you know there the news briefs
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That you see
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Once or twice a week
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But it was
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	News to us
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I mean clearly
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Police are now like the de-facto Frontline and dealing with mental illness in this country
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But when it got to bend Central Quest
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	What do the numbers say about race
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I think I'm start with the fact
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Stat
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'm not sure it was so surprising
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,479	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	40% of people shot by police
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Are black
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And that is that is out of whack with
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The Florida
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Demographic
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Text me what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not 40%
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It's more like 17
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:34,911	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	We shot by police
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Then if you're white

EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I guess what I thought is you know probably they have these long drawn-out legal battles and then
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	They go back to their lives
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Whatever

EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	In theory
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Approach the law
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And so what are they doing differently
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	First of all when all these the incidents were occurring in
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:17,920	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Around the country with Fergus and everything else we did it racing policing mandatory training for the entire PD and basically
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	What we wanted
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Our officers to do with number one learn the history of the country
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Good history of the country is that we are a racist Nation no matter how you look at it
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,904	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Started with moving the Indians
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Off of their land
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	For manifest destiny
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	When you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the Civil War youku
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,632	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Slavery when you look in the fitt bull connor for example
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'm turning the dog in fire hose is loose
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,472	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	On civil rights Marchers
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	George important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And you may think and I can't walk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:56,320	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	In in policing Vice we all have bias in it
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And a trick is at and I don't know what the trick I don't know of any of us know how to contain that
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,560	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	How do we stop at bias
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'm coming through when you make a decision
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:11,168	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And I think a lot about him
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Seems like
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:15,520	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I feel like a Kinder way to say

EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	How do you how do you train that out of an officer
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So that we make a traffic stop they're not already operating with a
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,072	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	This level of height
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Iran
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:48,192	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is perceived threat in my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You have to train using a real life scenarios
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That take that extra split-second
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:56,384	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Before you fire your weapon
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And I'll give you that it go to rubbery quickly when I first went to Philadelphia Police Department we were shooting people
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Had a crazy rate
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	On an accidental discharge
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:11,744	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The officer had your finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved you would get your back in
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:20,192	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Go back up to the police academy and we all had to be retrained on how to keep your finger on the side plate of the weapon
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:24,544	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:28,896	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And you went to photo is Armageddon oh my God going to get us killed one reality
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:33,248	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	What it did was it slow down your field division
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It's load everything on that split-second it make a difference that blink-of-an-eye didn't make a difference it made a difference in you not shooting
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	People that Split Second let you see what you thought may have been
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Did the color of my glass coming at my cell phone was it cell phone
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that you would come back to again and again is this idea of time
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	In certain situations
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Slow down
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,800	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	When you're dealing with a mentally ill person
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Slow down cover just crates in space to buy yourself another 30 seconds that extra 30
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	3 seconds maybe the difference between saving your life and somebody else's life
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Another interesting thing was
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Ben 10 Tennyson also threw some herbs reporting with other police chief
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:16,768	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is the idea that somebody's cheese don't like to hire kids at a high school like 19 20 year olds
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	In part because this
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Text a lot to communicate is like this
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Anyway when they look up and go to talk to somebody I'm and I'm serious about going through the drive-through McDonald's
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:27,520	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And I could piss off the person ordering cheeseburger
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,312	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Halle how did you do it
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Just her demeanor just the way they act
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And back then told me that he thought it in police chief who told him the young people were coming into the
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Academy
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Past years
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I've never been in a physical fight
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The problem because when they get into a fight their heart starts to race in the muscles tense up and I don't really know what to do so they
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,816	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Freak out and they're way more likely to draw weapon and use the weapons
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,144	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Tutu in the confrontation
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So how do you do that you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beating up on your messenger
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,336	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Says that that's why I at least you told me he looks

EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Freak out
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Dirty competition

EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:08,704	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Let multitude of videos that we show officers on the correct way to do things
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You know when and that's the point we get home or the officers used time and distance
EDL	00:40:14,336	00:40:15,360	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	To their advantage
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Didn't pull right up
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:20,736	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And right away
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	They use verbal command first
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Warren and let him know what's going on
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Trigger control with another thing
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You know what that Taser Taser Taser
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Heard a pop and fired his gun
EDL	00:40:38,400	00:40:44,800	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So you know he's appointment Kaiser and communication is this key communication with the person you're trying to arresting communication with you
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Your fellow officers
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:47,360	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Those are the things that we drive home
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,920	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And again there was no doubt in my mind
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:54,016	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That they won officer in particular knew that individual from prior contact
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:56,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Read minutes interesting to hear me say
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,600	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The name Derek
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,136	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Lake Derrick
EDL	00:40:59,136	00:41:00,416	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is Derek and Erika Sanchez

EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:02,976	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Shirtless with a knife in his hand
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	When there's no connection error
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It's a lot easier to see somebody is nameless and faceless and I got scared and I shot him
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:11,680	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But because of that knowing that officer
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:13,984	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Because of that and establish some kind of rapport
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That made the officer
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Think
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:28,576	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Lexi after we finish watching a video and I was packing up chat with told me that just a couple months after that incident

EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And the number one principle rather than being something Law and Order Law and Order is
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The sanctity of human life
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'm just a month after proof put out those principles to the biggest

EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:58,431	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Baby saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:42:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	More dangerous
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And then just like eight months later so the ICP and the Fraternal Order of Police
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Started to adopt
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Some of these
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Principles publicly
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:15,839	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Despite that there still is a bit of a divide between but according to Ben for the very first time I think you're seeing these masks
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Conversation
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The police weren't talking about this two or three years ago
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:23,775	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I don't know man just thinking about this like you've got these women
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Cool how I become kind of a political
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Force
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:31,711	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You have also this growing movement of cops who are
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:36,319	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Possibly changing way policing is done in America at least maybe slowly
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But cumulatively does
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,951	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I hesitate to use this word but it does make
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Just feel like
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Reason for Hope
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Ray and I thought the same
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Wait to bite
EDL	00:43:50,399	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It wasn't anything I had registered realized
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	How far
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Hope Has
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You go we are here to see Natasha Clements
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,407	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Natasha Clements the mother of Rodney

EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:12,415	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That's actually when I first met her
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And have been reporting on Natasha for like a couple years by this point
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Are they because Ben was going to hand a ton of documents over to Natasha on her son Ronnie's case
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Have any
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And I'm sad because we set up a short interview with Natasha but when we got to the door
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	She just started
EDL	00:44:36,991	00:44:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Sobbing
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Can I just had no
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Idea what happened
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:19,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Appendicitis
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:20,255	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Tape recorder off
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,303	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So what was
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	What was happening in that moment
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The backup
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	So meeting somebody like
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Chip wood
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,215	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You know
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,543	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I sort of hoping that I've believed
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:35,103	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The thing about a Chitwood
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Sheriff police chief is it
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The only have
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The power to fire
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:41,503	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Police officer
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And that's
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:44,063	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Good about it after that
EDL	00:45:44,063	00:45:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It goes into the court system
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:46,879	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And so
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Natasha
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:52,511	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Her son Ronnie 23 years old unarmed was shot and killed by
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:54,303	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Two police officers during a traffic stop
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:58,399	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	After the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong they attacked
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:00,191	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Accordance with the law
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It just so happened at 45 minutes before
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,055	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Bentonite
EDL	00:46:05,567	00:46:07,103	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Showed up at her door

EDL	00:46:10,687	00:46:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Filed
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:12,735	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Against that decision
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,271	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I had just been rejected
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	We sat there and Natasha's apartment for a while we actually

EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:15,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Not fair
EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:20,991	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Now as to what happened to Rodney that night then his look
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:24,063	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	A testimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Different court records
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	The piece together the events documents that night Rodney and his car
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:37,631	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Did Saturday gas station they left the gas station and we're driving down this highway windy in his little cousin

EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Doctor said he saw him without a seatbelt
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:50,431	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches vehicle one is kind of standing in front of the car about several feet away
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:53,759	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Towards like the driver side and also approaches his window

EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:01,183	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And and then orders Rodney to put the car in park
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:03,743	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Ronnie's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:06,303	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And he reaches down to put the car in park
EDL	00:49:06,303	00:49:08,607	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Invisible things in the story started to purge

EDL	00:50:00,831	00:50:01,599	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Question
EDL	00:50:01,599	00:50:02,623	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Why were the guns.

EDL	00:50:11,583	00:50:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And that's just it
EDL	00:50:13,887	00:50:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Deborah moment where you try and put yourself in the mind of those two officers
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Absolutely not because I would never do
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:20,799	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Buy skate like that
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:22,335	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But never
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Cross now
EDL	00:50:24,127	00:50:25,151	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I would never do that
EDL	00:50:25,663	00:50:26,431	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	You feel like it's like
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:30,015	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Do you feel like the cop in that moment
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Ronnie's black is what
EDL	00:50:32,319	00:50:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Frightens the cop
EDL	00:50:33,599	00:50:35,647	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That's why he pulls his gun out
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Pizza Boli's
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Hell if he if somebody gets hurt or somebody gets injured or killed
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	He's going to get off
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	He's behind the blue bad she's a bully
EDL	00:50:45,375	00:50:47,679	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is that what you think of cops like writ large
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	If I what is
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	That's exactly how it is Nokia Femmes and buts about it
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:55,615	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is it hard for me cuz I think like
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:59,967	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Like it's clear that there's discrimination with that exist within the police force
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:02,271	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And the people who they are
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Sworn to protect and serve
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:05,599	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But like at the end of the day
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	There's probably
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:10,463	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Ain't like no I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage of the number of officers
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Which lake
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,791	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Yes they're probably
EDL	00:51:13,791	00:51:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Violent individuals
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Don't belong in a place for us
EDL	00:51:17,119	00:51:17,887	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But I would
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Assume that like a majority of the cops
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:21,983	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Meanwell
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:24,799	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Have probably probably have
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Some sort of bias
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:26,847	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Where
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	They don't think I see
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	A black person
EDL	00:51:29,407	00:51:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And I'm going to Lake
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I'm going to get that boy
EDL	00:51:32,479	00:51:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	But that there's like it like there's some sort of triggered response
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And that the police
EDL	00:51:39,135	00:51:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Are currently being put into different situations where they
EDL	00:51:41,695	00:51:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	I feel under threat
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:44,255	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And concerned
EDL	00:51:45,023	00:51:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	And that like
EDL	00:51:46,303	00:51:47,071	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It looks like a
EDL	00:51:47,071	00:51:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Whole host of factors leading to this moment for somebody
EDL	00:51:50,399	00:51:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Is shot and killed
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	It's not just that they're out here
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,751	| radiolab_podcast17shotsfiredone |	Bullying people
