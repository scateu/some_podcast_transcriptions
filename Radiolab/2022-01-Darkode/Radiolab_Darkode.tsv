EDL	00:00:01,020	00:00:01,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Oh, wait. 
EDL	00:00:01,500	00:00:03,740	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:00:03,740	00:00:03,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Alright. 
EDL	00:00:03,790	00:00:06,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:06,360	00:00:09,560	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Alright, you're listening to radiolab. 
EDL	00:00:09,560	00:00:10,440	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:00:10,440	00:00:12,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Radio from W N Y .... 
EDL	00:00:12,960	00:00:16,618	| Radiolab_Darkode |	C
EDL	00:00:16,618	00:00:21,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 8.4 secs ]

EDL	00:00:21,360	00:00:26,923	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Hey, this is radiolab last year, a cyber attack disrupted the colonial pipeline ...
EDL	00:00:26,923	00:00:28,606	| Radiolab_Darkode |	was a big year for cyber crime. 
EDL	00:00:28,606	00:00:33,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The FBI confirms it's investigating 100 different types of ransomware attacks. 

EDL	00:00:33,780	00:00:50,560	| Radiolab_Darkode |	According to the FBI, the amount of money taken by ransomware has gone up by more than 1000 percent over the past five years, and this got us t thinking about this episode we did on this new kind of crime way back in its relatively quaint early days (古朴的早期) in 2015 called Darkode.
EDL	00:00:50,560	00:00:52,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]

EDL	00:00:52,950	00:00:55,140	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Hey, I'm Jad Abrumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. 
EDL	00:00:55,140	00:00:55,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:00:55,460	00:00:57,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This is radiolab and today. well. 
EDL	00:00:57,200	00:01:03,170	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Today, we're going to tell you a story which we hope does not become your future, but it raises a simple question. 
EDL	00:01:03,170	00:01:04,570	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We all have computers. 
EDL	00:01:04,570	00:01:05,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We love computers. 
EDL	00:01:05,470	00:01:17,590	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We depend upon computers, but what if the cost of using your computer becomes more than you're willing to pay two stories today, which suggests that we might be at the very beginning of a nightmare. 
EDL	00:01:17,590	00:01:18,400	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

* The first story
EDL	00:01:18,400	00:01:22,560	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The first comes from a journalist, Inna Simone, and her mother Alina. 
EDL	00:01:22,560	00:01:23,970	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I mean, do you want to start with my mom? 
EDL	00:01:23,970	00:01:30,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Cause it really happened to her, you know, she only got in touch with me, maybe on day six. ..
EDL	00:01:30,200	00:01:31,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Okay, so ...
EDL	00:01:31,210	00:01:34,370	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, day 1 what happened was the first first thing that happened. 
EDL	00:01:34,370	00:01:35,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	On day 1. 
EDL	00:01:35,200	00:01:35,980	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:35,980	00:01:50,640	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What happened that I called Tufts University IT services because my husband complaining that my computer is unbearably unbearably slow. 
EDL	00:01:50,640	00:01:51,180	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:51,180	00:01:54,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She tells IT I don't know what's going on every time I try and open a window, it's like click. 
EDL	00:01:54,360	00:01:55,130	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:55,130	00:02:05,770	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Pop click. practically stop to work in what do I do, they checked whatever, I said and probably nothing rebooted, so did nothing. 
EDL	00:02:05,770	00:02:27,840	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Basically, then, she went away for the weekend, and when I came back, I turned the computer on and like it was doing something, and I saw many, many windows covering a screen, and those windows multiplied. 
EDL	00:02:27,840	00:02:28,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:02:28,780	00:02:32,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I cannot open any of them, and I could not figure ...
EDL	00:02:32,910	00:02:37,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But it was very late at night, so she went bed. 
EDL	00:02:37,470	00:02:38,080	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:38,080	00:02:42,340	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Got up the next day called Tufts again, asking for help
EDL	00:02:42,340	00:02:43,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They had no idea what was going on.  - No
EDL	00:02:43,320	00:02:43,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:43,760	00:02:49,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She says at this point, whatever the computer had been doing, it was done. All windows disappeared
EDL	00:02:49,360	00:02:51,620	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Except now, anytime she tried to click. 
EDL	00:02:51,620	00:02:52,520	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Any of her files. 
EDL	00:02:52,520	00:03:00,120	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Pictures, videos I cannot open any of them. Instead, every time this message would pop up.
EDL	00:03:00,120	00:03:03,920	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And the message says, what happened to your files. 
EDL	00:03:03,920	00:03:05,230	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:03:05,230	00:03:11,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	All of your files have been protected with a strong encryption, encrypted using crypto wall. 
EDL	00:03:11,000	00:03:15,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This means that the structure and data within your file have been irrevocably (不可撤回地) changed. 
EDL	00:03:15,960	00:03:16,430	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:16,430	00:03:18,230	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And in order to
EDL	00:03:18,230	00:03:25,030	| Radiolab_Darkode |	get them back to unlock files, you must pay five hundred US dollars if you really value your data,
EDL	00:03:25,030	00:03:25,560	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:25,560	00:03:31,840	| Radiolab_Darkode |	then we suggest that you do not waste valuable time searching for the solutions because they do not exist. 
EDL	00:03:31,840	00:03:32,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:32,360	00:03:33,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You're saying that somebody. 
EDL	00:03:33,790	00:03:34,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:03:34,110	00:03:37,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Went into your computer and locked up all of your things, yeah. 
EDL	00:03:37,910	00:03:40,530	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They gave me the exact count. 
EDL	00:03:40,530	00:03:44,420	| Radiolab_Darkode |	5726 files encrypted. 
EDL	00:03:44,420	00:03:48,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Wait, when you say they, did you have any image in your head of who's. 
EDL	00:03:48,110	00:04:02,670	| Radiolab_Darkode |	My first thought was Russia or Ukraine, which is even better. - Why? - Because you know everybody talks about excellent fantastic education there, especially math.
EDL	00:04:02,670	00:04:05,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'm from there, I know.  - You know, she's right. 
EDL	00:04:05,200	00:04:14,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They surpassed (胜过) the US and educating their kids when it comes to math and science, and they've got a severe underemployment (未就业) problem. 
EDL	00:04:14,020	00:04:21,205	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Especially outside of the major cities, which is where these viruses often trace down to not Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but we're talking about, you know, backwater. 
EDL	00:04:21,205	00:04:31,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I was so positive that it comes from that part of the world that I wrote them in Russian. 
EDL	00:04:31,320	00:04:31,660	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:31,660	00:04:36,264	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[..] the criminal said, provided a link to a website where she could send them a message, you know. Customer support. 
EDL	00:04:36,264	00:04:40,270	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I wrote them До все сдохли 
EDL	00:04:40,270	00:04:40,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:40,580	00:04:44,270	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I don't know how to translate it in English more accurately. 
EDL	00:04:44,270	00:04:58,265	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Something like I wish you all die, but in Russian language, the word to die for humans or another word for animals.
EDL	00:04:58,265	00:05:03,010	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Use the animal one, of course, but you know they got the message. 
EDL	00:05:03,010	00:05:03,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:05:03,320	00:05:13,620	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Now Inna sais, she thought about just wiping the computer clean so that she wouldn't have to pay, but then it occurred to her that her husband had all these files on there, you know, like. 
EDL	00:05:13,620	00:05:16,940	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Business receipts that he hadn't filed yet, but he's lazy to do so. 
EDL	00:05:16,940	00:05:23,510	| Radiolab_Darkode |	He has [..] and and she's right that like, you know, she has this tax information, and this reimbursement information, and ultimately. 
EDL	00:05:23,510	00:05:25,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's worth more than 500 dollars. 
EDL	00:05:25,470	00:05:28,340	| Radiolab_Darkode |	My husband did not want to pay, I overruled him.
EDL	00:05:28,340	00:05:31,700	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 3.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:31,700	00:05:35,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So Inna decides to follow the instructions basically. 
EDL	00:05:35,760	00:05:36,300	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:36,300	00:05:38,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	1. download and installed Tor browser, so. 
EDL	00:05:38,930	00:05:41,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She goes and installs this browser called Tor, which apparently. 
EDL	00:05:41,760	00:05:51,797	| Radiolab_Darkode |	is not traceable 2. Run the browser and wait for initialization, she does that. 3. type in the address bar k pi 7YCR7jX Q 
EDL	00:05:51,797	00:05:55,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	then she's directed to a site where basically tells her, look, if you don't trust us.
EDL	00:05:55,320	00:06:04,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We can decrypt one of your files for free as a sample that when you pay us. 
EDL	00:06:04,280	00:06:12,570	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You would know that you could really get all your files back, and I was curious. 
EDL	00:06:12,570	00:06:15,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I decided that I will try. 
EDL	00:06:15,470	00:06:15,810	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:06:15,810	00:06:18,310	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So she clicked the button that said yes, and. 
EDL	00:06:18,310	00:06:18,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:18,680	00:06:30,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I got one file back, but as soon as I did the clocks that taken, literally, she says, a little clock appeared at the top of the browser. 
EDL	00:06:30,930	00:06:39,270	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They gave me exactly 7 days. 167 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds. 
EDL	00:06:39,270	00:06:39,800	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:06:39,800	00:06:42,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So you decrypt the thing and then suddenly it's a countdown. 
EDL	00:06:42,200	00:06:42,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:06:42,500	00:06:43,870	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yes, they say. 
EDL	00:06:43,870	00:06:46,510	| Radiolab_Darkode |	If you won't pay by this day. 
EDL	00:06:46,510	00:07:01,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Then, the fine, will be doubled, and if you won't pay in one [..], then you will lose your files forever, and you'll never get it back. 
EDL	00:07:01,000	00:07:01,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:01,500	00:07:07,840	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Now in the message, it had told you that she had to pay that 500 dollar fine, not in dollars, but in bitcoin. 
EDL	00:07:07,840	00:07:28,380	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, this was the first time in my life ever I heard the term bitcoins, so I uh found this website called coin cafe, where you can buy bitcoins and to buy this bitcoins is a nightmare. 
EDL	00:07:28,380	00:07:44,810	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's a torture. What she needed to do was exchange 500 bucks for the requisite (必要的) amount of bitcoins, and at the time 500 bucks equal 1.37 bitcoins, but before she could make that exchange, she had to fill out all these forms of these questions. 
EDL	00:07:44,810	00:07:46,070	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What happened? 
EDL	00:07:46,070	00:07:54,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What is the reason to buy bitcoin, and reasons were listed that one of them was ransom, so they knew that was. 
EDL	00:07:54,790	00:07:55,260	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:55,260	00:08:02,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yes, it was the first reason to pay ransom to the criminals. Next, she says. 
EDL	00:08:02,790	00:08:16,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	after you fill out all the forms, you have to make a picture and send them a photograph through the internet, OK? I did not have a camera. Because, she says her camera happened to be in the shop. 
EDL	00:08:16,950	00:08:30,540	| Radiolab_Darkode |	More than that, I have to make a picture of my husband holding a driver's license, send them this picture back. 
EDL	00:08:30,540	00:08:31,670	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:08:31,670	00:08:40,420	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It is the bank with the criminals? No, this is the people who sell you bitcoins in exchange for your money. 
EDL	00:08:40,420	00:08:43,970	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I told you that it's a torture is unbelievable. 
EDL	00:08:43,970	00:08:47,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But eventually she was able to find a neighbor, borrow the camera, take the picture she needs to take. 
EDL	00:08:47,960	00:08:57,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Then she had to get the money she wanted to exchange to coin cafe, and it turns out the preferred way to do it the most secure way to do it is not online, but through a money order. 
EDL	00:08:57,780	00:09:05,590	| Radiolab_Darkode |	At least for the day right before the Thanksgiving, Wednesday. She still had about six days before the deadline, so she thought, all right. 
EDL	00:09:05,590	00:09:08,730	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'll just pop down to the post office, get a money order. But, 
EDL	00:09:08,730	00:09:09,480	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:09:09,480	00:09:10,440	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Live from Boston. 
EDL	00:09:10,440	00:09:11,870	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:11,870	00:09:18,300	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Lexington and the whole Massachusetts had a terrible, terrible snowstorm.  For a lot of us. 
EDL	00:09:18,300	00:09:26,787	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This could be the biggest storm so far this winter. undrivable road. but I had to go to the post office.
EDL	00:09:26,787	00:09:33,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So she ploughs (犁,奋力穿过) through the snow almost kills herself, but gets there, gets everything together, sends it off. 
EDL	00:09:33,580	00:09:34,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:09:34,460	00:09:39,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	so finally, I send everything out. 
EDL	00:09:39,000	00:09:49,650	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The post office assured me that they will get it on Friday, which is the first working day after that Thanksgiving. Okay. 
EDL	00:09:49,650	00:09:52,710	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So on Friday, she called coin cafe,
EDL	00:09:52,710	00:09:56,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	they did not get it. On Saturday. 
EDL	00:09:56,110	00:10:01,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They did not get it. On Monday morning, nothing was delivered. 
EDL	00:10:01,110	00:10:01,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:10:01,500	00:10:07,070	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And I was desperate because my deadline was Tuesday, something
EDL	00:10:07,070	00:10:17,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	like 12 o'clock, and I started calling the post office whatever nobody knows anything, they said yes two days, but there is no guarantee finally. 
EDL	00:10:17,950	00:10:21,520	| Radiolab_Darkode |	4 o'clock in the afternoon on Monday, but. 
EDL	00:10:21,520	00:10:23,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	24 hours before the deadline, they've got it.
EDL	00:10:23,020	00:10:24,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:10:24,160	00:10:32,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, and they send me bitcoins in exchange because they got my money, but. 
EDL	00:10:32,850	00:10:35,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She says when she went online to check her bitcoin account. 
EDL	00:10:35,850	00:10:44,880	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'm 13 dollars short. 
EDL	00:10:44,880	00:10:46,440	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:46,440	00:10:48,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Then basically, the exchange rate has changed on her. 
EDL	00:10:48,680	00:10:50,550	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She bought it at 500, now it's 487
EDL	00:10:50,550	00:10:52,650	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:10:52,650	00:11:01,040	| Radiolab_Darkode |	How often do you change the exchange rate and they said every minute, but it's not a joke. 
EDL	00:11:01,040	00:11:16,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, every minute, I said, are you crazy, I was a double victim, I was victim square or victim cube, you see, because driving was terrible, I have to stand on my head to get a camera. 
EDL	00:11:16,790	00:11:20,660	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And then I was struggling to send them. 
EDL	00:11:20,660	00:11:22,620	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's the problem with this crime. 
EDL	00:11:22,620	00:11:25,990	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The criminals need a better way to get money from the victim. 
EDL	00:11:25,990	00:11:28,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But everything else is traceable. 
EDL	00:11:28,020	00:11:28,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:11:28,360	00:11:29,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'm on the edge of my seat here. 
EDL	00:11:29,680	00:11:32,220	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So the you're 13 dollars short. 
EDL	00:11:32,220	00:11:34,260	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:11:34,260	00:11:41,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I am calling a day, they said, there is one more way, one more way, and what is it. 
EDL	00:11:41,760	00:11:43,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We have an ATM machine. 
EDL	00:11:43,950	00:11:45,120	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:11:45,120	00:11:51,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I said what, yeah, we have an ATM machine, only one and I said
EDL	00:11:51,500	00:11:54,750	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Where is it, it's in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, New York? 
EDL	00:11:54,750	00:11:55,060	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:11:55,060	00:11:56,150	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, oh. 
EDL	00:11:56,150	00:11:57,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Well, 200 miles away. 
EDL	00:11:57,200	00:11:58,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Wait a second, I don't understand this. 
EDL	00:11:58,780	00:12:03,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There was one ATM that is in the borough (区) of Brooklyn where you do not live. Exactly. 
EDL	00:12:03,910	00:12:04,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:12:04,500	00:12:12,040	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But luckily, her daughter Alina lives in Brooklyn, you ask me how my daughter got involved, that's how. So she calls Alina, yeah. 
EDL	00:12:12,040	00:12:14,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	My mom called me the night before the ransom was due.
EDL	00:12:14,850	00:12:16,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Are you aware of any of this at that point?
EDL	00:12:16,460	00:12:16,980	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:16,980	00:12:17,890	| Radiolab_Darkode |	no, no. 
EDL	00:12:17,890	00:12:19,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I remember, you know, I was at night. 
EDL	00:12:19,210	00:12:21,340	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I had the TV on and I have a toddler. 
EDL	00:12:21,340	00:12:23,370	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, I always all these things going on. 
EDL	00:12:23,370	00:12:24,890	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I was probably on my laptop too. 
EDL	00:12:24,890	00:12:29,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I was doing like 12 things, and my mom called, and she was like, upset with a capital U. 
EDL	00:12:29,580	00:12:32,370	| Radiolab_Darkode |	She started ranting (咆哮) about criminals and ransom. 
EDL	00:12:32,370	00:12:32,750	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:32,750	00:12:35,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And I literally thought she was like talking in air quotes. 
EDL	00:12:35,460	00:12:42,870	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'm like, oh, yeah, I know when I go to Texas and like, yeah, they're extortion (敲诈), and my mom was like, no, like, no, really a ransom. 
EDL	00:12:42,870	00:12:43,240	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:43,240	00:12:53,814	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They're really criminals, her mom told her Google crytowall, and I was like, holy shit this is really a thing, plus I started googling as she suggested I do 
EDL	00:12:53,814	00:13:05,619	| Radiolab_Darkode |	and found out the police departments had paid this, that sheriff's department in Dickson, Tennessee, has just paid it to unlock like you know, 70 plus thousand case files, and I was like, yeah. 
EDL	00:13:05,619	00:13:20,370	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Hold, so these crooks go after police department.  They've got after governments, universities, corporations, police departments and did a question ever why my mom. - no, not at all, because like a million people in the US have been infected with this very thing. 
EDL	00:13:20,370	00:13:25,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yes, anyhow, next day, less than six hours left. Inna says to Alina
EDL	00:13:25,320	00:13:28,180	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Please go to this ATM so we can just be done with this whole thing. 
EDL	00:13:28,180	00:13:44,300	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You can got it later, but I can tell you that in the morning, she said, I have a date for my granddaughter date to play that I won't be able to do it until 12 o'clock, and they called again, I said. 
EDL	00:13:44,300	00:13:45,080	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I am crazy. 
EDL	00:13:45,080	00:13:45,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:13:45,460	00:13:50,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I don't have time, so I go out to green point, this ATM, and you know. 
EDL	00:13:50,930	00:14:00,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I just want to add that what do you had your play date. you didn't I called you. 
EDL	00:14:00,000	00:14:07,255	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Fortunately, you make it right, okay, so I cut my play date short. sorry, forget that crucial detail. 
EDL	00:14:07,255	00:14:11,007	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And I go out to green point, and they have an ATM and,

EDL	00:14:11,007	00:14:17,480	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I'm just worried that there's going to be 57 people, all lined up at the single ATM, but you're there were. 
EDL	00:14:17,480	00:14:18,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Totally not 57 people. 
EDL	00:14:18,910	00:14:24,180	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I mean, most people do take care of this um remotely like there was no one at this ATM. 
EDL	00:14:24,180	00:14:26,430	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But what's funny about the ATM is like i'm expecting, like. 
EDL	00:14:26,430	00:14:29,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, i've been to an ATM a capital one account. 
EDL	00:14:29,160	00:14:35,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I know what an ATM is, you know, but this is on the second floor of a workshare space in Brooklyn. 
EDL	00:14:35,000	00:14:39,540	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It was like, in the hallway, there was like a bike hanging from a wall kind of blocking in. 
EDL	00:14:39,540	00:14:49,720	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There was like a paper sign taped to the wall that just had a print out from a computer that just said Bitcoin ATM, all lower case letters in an arrow to this phone booth. 
EDL	00:14:49,720	00:14:50,360	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:50,360	00:14:54,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It looked very Soviet like if you've seen photos of those phones with no botnets. 
EDL	00:14:54,780	00:14:55,370	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:55,370	00:14:58,136	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The receiver and it's totally scary, it's like red line?
EDL	00:14:58,136	00:14:58,827	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
EDL	00:14:58,827	00:15:02,510	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You just pick it up and like somebody's always on the other line or something. 
EDL	00:15:02,510	00:15:08,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It was like that it was just this box with a screen and no botnets and a camera eye. 
EDL	00:15:08,020	00:15:08,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:08,460	00:15:13,140	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And what you do is you hold up your QVC code, is that what they're called QVC?
EDL	00:15:13,140	00:15:18,230	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What are they QRC, the barcode? Yeah, yeah, it's like a barcode. 
EDL	00:15:18,230	00:15:19,810	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:15:19,810	00:15:21,980	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And my mom had emailed it to me and was like. 
EDL	00:15:21,980	00:15:35,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You need to print this out, and this is essentially gives you access to my account to top it off, you know, and so I put this QRC code up to the camera eye, and it kind of, [blup], and then it was like we are accessing your account. 
EDL	00:15:35,930	00:15:37,710	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:15:37,710	00:15:39,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I got a spinny wheel. 
EDL	00:15:39,350	00:15:46,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You've got the wheel of death, no... spinning wheel, Alina starts frantically (发狂似的) dialing her mom, the guys at Coin Cafe. 
EDL	00:15:46,780	00:15:55,090	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I called, you know, I left like three phone messages and I left far, so finally, they called me back like 20 minutes later. 
EDL	00:15:55,090	00:15:58,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Said, okay, we're sending a technician over to fix the machine. 
EDL	00:15:58,350	00:15:59,390	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Which was very cool. 
EDL	00:15:59,390	00:16:03,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I didn't think that would happen, and so you know, the technician was there, and he. 
EDL	00:16:03,930	00:16:04,840	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Fixed the machine. 
EDL	00:16:04,840	00:16:08,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And he helped me deposit these 25 dollars. 
EDL	00:16:08,160	00:16:17,290	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And then he was talking and he was he was like, yeah, you know, he knew my mom, because you know, he'd been talking to her on the phone. He's like, I feel so bad for your mom. 
EDL	00:16:17,290	00:16:21,610	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We've been getting so many of these cases, and i'm like, why are you why are. - a lot of these cases? 
EDL	00:16:21,610	00:16:23,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, I was like, why are you guys getting so? 
EDL	00:16:23,960	00:16:26,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Why is everyone coming to you, and he's like, oh, I know why. 
EDL	00:16:26,580	00:16:33,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Because in the ransom note that they give a list of preferred vendors and we are number one, or two.

EDL	00:16:33,210	00:16:45,170	| Radiolab_Darkode |	introduction what a bad introduction to bitcoin like we're going to hold you ransom for all your information until you, you know, use this new currency to pay us off, I mean, that's so terrible. 
EDL	00:16:45,170	00:16:46,870	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This is Mike and John . 
EDL	00:16:46,870	00:16:48,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They are the co-owners of coin cafe. 
EDL	00:16:48,960	00:16:57,248	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I had a few weeks back, a grandmother who was in tears. She was going to lose all of her family photos, and because the deadline was coming up, you know. 
EDL	00:16:57,248	00:17:00,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Crying on the phone to me and god it, it felt horrible
EDL	00:17:00,500	00:17:14,810	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Now clearly, people who sell bitcoin just believe that there should be a digital currency that is decentralized, that doesn't rely on the banks, but unfortunately, it has become the currency of choice for ransom, and so, they're in this weird position. so,
EDL	00:17:14,810	00:17:18,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's a tricky thing, because like I can't sell bitcoin to someone who,
EDL	00:17:18,580	00:17:20,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I know is going to do something illegal with it, right?
EDL	00:17:20,580	00:17:34,290	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's Will Wheeler, who runs a bitcoin exchange called express coin, and he says he and other exchanges are really worried right now that if they keep helping the little guys pay the ransom in order to get their files back, they are, in effect, making themselves accessories to a crime. 
EDL	00:17:34,290	00:17:36,740	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I finally got a call back from Vincent,
EDL	00:17:36,740	00:17:37,220	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:37,220	00:17:41,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	which is the federal authority for a financial crime enforcement network. 
EDL	00:17:41,680	00:17:48,430	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They said that we could perceive paying a ransom, unlawful activity. 
EDL	00:17:48,430	00:17:52,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And so they might choose to use that against the company. 
EDL	00:17:52,470	00:18:02,820	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Who helps out right and likely until we get a straight answer from Vincent, we'll take the overly cautious approach and start declining these transactions, even though in your heart, you want to help. 
EDL	00:18:02,820	00:18:08,860	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I mean, do I want to risk being indicted for helping you get your travel receipts reimbursed from your company. 
EDL	00:18:08,860	00:18:11,130	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And I mean, to me, the answer is no. 
EDL	00:18:11,130	00:18:12,120	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:18:12,120	00:18:12,900	| Radiolab_Darkode |	In any case. 
EDL	00:18:12,900	00:18:16,130	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 3.2 secs ]
EDL	00:18:16,130	00:18:23,810	| Radiolab_Darkode |	After Alina deposits the extra 25 bucks in her mom's bitcoin account, Inna the mom goes online. 
EDL	00:18:23,810	00:18:26,420	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Then I clicked and it was gone. 
EDL	00:18:26,420	00:18:28,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:18:28,020	00:18:38,800	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But then about an hour later, I went to my computer and there was another message that "you are late".
EDL	00:18:38,800	00:18:40,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:18:40,280	00:18:44,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It turns out that I was two and a half hours late. 
EDL	00:18:44,280	00:18:45,040	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:18:45,040	00:18:53,640	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You have to pay 1300 dollars roughly, I did not have anybody to turn to. 
EDL	00:18:53,640	00:18:56,560	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So she went to that same website where you can write them a message. 
EDL	00:18:56,560	00:19:09,217	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I wrote them that I was late, but I mentioned the snowstorm, the things given, which they probably will not bear off. 
EDL	00:19:09,217	00:19:34,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And of course, the the wonderful US mail service, I said that I tried and I was only two hours late. And then all of a sudden, I am getting a message you paid in full without any explanation, nothing. You paid. 
EDL	00:19:34,350	00:19:34,890	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:19:34,890	00:19:38,220	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's it, and I got all my files back. 
EDL	00:19:38,220	00:19:40,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:19:40,350	00:19:42,670	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Do you think that they took pity on her?
EDL	00:19:42,670	00:19:47,100	| Radiolab_Darkode |	maybe. I felt that it's over. 
EDL	00:19:47,100	00:19:50,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Finally, it's really over. 
EDL	00:19:50,210	00:19:57,570	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 7.4 secs ]
EDL	00:19:57,570	00:20:01,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It does make you wonder who these people are there?
EDL	00:20:01,020	00:20:01,590	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:01,590	00:20:03,070	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We've a story about that up next. 
EDL	00:20:03,070	00:20:18,480	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 15.4 secs ]
EDL	00:20:18,480	00:20:20,890	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Hey, I'm Jad Abrumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
EDL	00:20:20,890	00:20:25,820	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This is radiolab, so here's the next obvious question, who did this to Inna? Do we know anything about them?
EDL	00:20:25,820	00:20:37,710	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But we put that question to Joseph Menn, investigate reporter for Reuters, done ton of work in this area, and his hunch (直觉) was that Inna is right. We're talking people Russian speaking folks by and large. 
EDL	00:20:37,710	00:20:44,100	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Do you have a book called fatal system error, which is sort of a deep dive into the Russian hacking scene and much of it as you would expect. 
EDL	00:20:44,100	00:20:46,550	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, young guys, early 20s
EDL	00:20:46,550	00:20:49,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Of grubby, by and large, they do not live a lavish (大方的) lifestyle. 
EDL	00:20:49,760	00:21:12,258	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There are guys at the top of these criminal organizations that are very flashy. And they're sort of pop icon, some of them in the same way that rap stars are in the US there's a hacker magazine, which you know as guys with their sports cars and the supermodels and whatever, you know, buying bottle service at you know. 
EDL	00:21:12,258	00:21:14,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Discos between the morning. 
EDL	00:21:14,020	00:21:15,770	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Those are the guys who hire the twenty year olds. 
EDL	00:21:15,770	00:21:22,070	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They hire the twenty year old or their franchises, and he says the twenty year old grants work at office Parks yeah. 
EDL	00:21:22,070	00:21:26,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And it's like a call center type of atmosphere. so is there like, you know. 
EDL	00:21:26,210	00:21:35,750	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's producer Kelsey Patrick. I went in a cubicle, at his computer board, he has a meeting later with Judy in HR, and he's mad about it. 
EDL	00:21:35,750	00:21:40,060	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Is that the kind of like environment that these people are in? For the most part,
EDL	00:21:40,060	00:21:45,970	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So yes. the larger point is that it's not just like your lone wolf, pimply faced hacker anymore. 
EDL	00:21:45,970	00:21:49,050	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Cybercrime is now super organized.

EDL	00:22:01,650	00:22:05,820	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There are these underground web forums, and there's a variety, some are available.

EDL	00:22:39,690	00:22:50,400	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So let's say someone is looking for a bunch of credit card numbers that have been stolen, you can get it there. There's one price if they're mastercard gold and another price for you know, a higher level credit, whatever. Let's say.

EDL	00:22:50,860	00:22:56,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You wanted to know about a boss or an employee or a girlfriend. You can get this piece of software that allows you to turn on their phone
EDL	00:22:56,960	00:23:00,793	| Radiolab_Darkode |	at any time. You could basically eavesdrop (窃听) on them because you're in the pocket. 
EDL	00:23:00,793	00:23:06,650	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And for 300 dollars a month, you would actually get customer service. And the prices actually keep coming down. 
EDL	00:23:06,650	00:23:10,300	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's a very, very evolved fluid marketplace. 
EDL	00:23:10,300	00:23:12,530	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There's feedback and there's escrow (第三方保管). 
EDL	00:23:12,530	00:23:14,080	| Radiolab_Darkode |	There are feedback forums.

EDL	00:23:18,270	00:23:32,144	| Radiolab_Darkode |	The robbery right? Absolutely. Particularly for something you'll see it a lot for freshness of credit cards because you know it's easy to say, you know, here are 10000 credit card numbers, but if they're credit card numbers, they've been out for a while and get declined, everybody, you've just wasted your money. 
EDL	00:23:32,144	00:23:40,100	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And these people are called as rippers, and they're ripping you off. And they will get banned from the forum. Wow, so it's reputational, just like everywhere else. 
EDL	00:23:40,100	00:23:41,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, and it's it's as good as Ebay. 
EDL	00:23:41,930	00:23:47,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	If you feel safe doing business on Ebay, there's no reason you shouldn't feel safe doing business with the criminals. 
EDL	00:23:47,680	00:23:53,620	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Now all of this to me frankly felt like just sexy hacker talk until a couple of months ago. 
EDL	00:23:53,620	00:23:59,060	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Dina started telling us about this one particular site, actually the biggest of these kinds of sites that's out there. 
EDL	00:23:59,060	00:23:59,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's called Darkode.

EDL	00:24:00,260	00:24:05,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, the way it has been described by law enforcement is sort of an Amazon.com 
EDL	00:24:05,000	00:24:10,490	| Radiolab_Darkode |	for hackers. Actually here, specifically how US attorney David Higgson described to her in an interview, Darkode 
EDL	00:24:10,490	00:24:15,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	is the largest English speaking criminal cyber crime forum in the world.

EDL	00:24:16,150	00:24:28,540	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And, I think most people know silk road, and they know, for example, you could get a contract hit from silk road and drugs and guns and everything else, so would it be right for me to say that this was sort of a silk road for hackers?
EDL	00:24:28,540	00:24:30,420	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, I wouldn't want to draw that direct comparison. 
EDL	00:24:30,420	00:24:32,030	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I think it's probably accurate. 
EDL	00:24:32,030	00:24:39,090	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I would say that all measure of cybercrime you see and watch around the world was in some form of fashion connected to it.

EDL	00:24:40,600	00:24:42,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So we got really interested in this world of this site. 
EDL	00:24:42,910	00:24:46,050	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Darkode and the people in it, and so with Dina,
EDL	00:24:46,050	00:24:49,450	| Radiolab_Darkode |	We started calling around trying to find anyone that would talk. 
EDL	00:24:49,450	00:24:56,480	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And after weeks of searching and calling and lawyering, we found a guy who agreed to go in the record. My name is Daniel Placik. 
EDL	00:24:56,480	00:24:58,910	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And I am a reformed hacker.

EDL	00:25:00,170	00:25:06,000	| Radiolab_Darkode |	As far as we know, Dan has never talked about this, publicly. So how did you get involved with Darkode? Well,
EDL	00:25:06,000	00:25:11,410	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I was one of the people who created it, a very long time ago.

EDL	00:25:15,360	00:25:16,690	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Well, let me let me start with a little bit of a ...
EDL	00:25:16,690	00:25:17,030	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:25:17,030	00:25:19,990	| Radiolab_Darkode |	small middle class suburb right outside Milwaukee. 
EDL	00:25:19,990	00:25:23,330	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You have brothers and sisters? Two younger brothers and two younger sisters,
EDL	00:25:23,330	00:25:31,060	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Big family. Did you have to share rooms with them or in your own little Kingdom. I shared a room with both my brothers for a lot of years. 
EDL	00:25:31,060	00:25:38,050	| Radiolab_Darkode |	In fact, that sort of plays into the story because he says what he would do to sort of escape, he's go to the basement and play video games. 
EDL	00:25:38,050	00:25:41,420	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So, yes, the stereotypical hacker in his parents' basement.

EDL	00:25:45,700	00:25:50,760	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Dan says his hacking began innocently enough when he would monkey with games like Age of Empires. 
EDL	00:25:50,760	00:25:54,230	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I changed the graphics, changed the artificial intelligence in the game,
EDL	00:25:54,230	00:26:09,557	| Radiolab_Darkode |	the way it plays, rework it, create new maps, that type of thing um, something I enjoyed. And slowly throughout my teenage years that developed into something more, 
EDL	00:26:09,557	00:26:15,250	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I did not get along well with a lot of my peers in in great middle schools. 
EDL	00:26:15,250	00:26:26,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So I spent um a lot more time on the computer and on myself than I did socially, at least at that age. And he says one day he was in,
EDL	00:26:26,320	00:26:35,180	| Radiolab_Darkode |	A chat room and an Internet chat room was called game search, talking with a bunch of other people loved video games. And at some point along the way, he meets this guy. 
EDL	00:26:35,180	00:26:39,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, this particular guy was into, you know, botnets. 
EDL	00:26:39,020	00:26:39,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:26:39,950	00:26:49,260	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Oh, yes, botnets, we all cry, just remind us, what's what's going on there? Botnets are you know, malware viruses installed on computers. 
EDL	00:26:49,260	00:27:02,739	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And, botnets are the way to centrally control a whole lot of affected computers. Just to put this in context for saying, I think this is totally fascinating, Joseph Menn says this whole botnet situation started with spam. 
EDL	00:27:02,739	00:27:12,700	| Radiolab_Darkode |	One of the easiest ways to make money on the internet back to 2000 was spam. Spam is, in an opinion extensions, and i'm in Nairobi.

EDL	00:27:14,020	00:27:20,100	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What happened was that in the olden days, most servers, mail servers, acted as open relays. 
EDL	00:27:20,100	00:27:25,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Meaning the mail people wouldn't really pay attention to who was sending, so the spammers with. 
EDL	00:27:25,160	00:27:31,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Spam with abandon. And then spammers got to be enough of a problem that the techies of the world decided that's it.

EDL	00:27:31,930	00:27:41,330	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They started to block people like if they found a guy who they thought was sending too many product emails or whatever, they would block his IP address so that he couldn't send any more mail. 
EDL	00:27:41,330	00:27:50,010	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So what the spammers and their contractors then needed to do was to have a bunch of clean IP addresses and send spam. 
EDL	00:27:50,010	00:27:59,400	| Radiolab_Darkode |	From that, so what they did, which is totally genius, totally evil, is they hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of viruses, disseminated (传播) those viruses across the internet.

EDL	00:28:04,750	00:28:16,902	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And then suddenly the spammers could now remote control our computers at a distance, whatever they wanted for maybe just an hour or two a night to send out their spam because these were clean IP addresses. 
EDL	00:28:16,902	00:28:26,390	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Of course, what happened is that once the spammers had these botnets, they started thinking, hey, I could do something else with this, and the next thing that came along was denial of service attacks. 
EDL	00:28:26,390	00:28:39,340	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You can have all of them try to contact Ebay.com at the same time, and knock over Ebay. This first gentleman that I ran into, so he had a botnet of well over 1000 computers, which you know at the time was amazing to me. 
EDL	00:28:39,340	00:28:42,590	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, by today's standards of thousands for a botnet, that is, is nothing. 
EDL	00:28:42,590	00:28:44,020	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Now they can get up into the millions. 
EDL	00:28:44,020	00:28:55,580	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But um, you know, back then, it was quite incredible to me. And because he says he was in this chat room, this guy was there and this guy would get into fights with people. And any time he did, he'd point his 1000 computer drone army at that enemy. 
EDL	00:28:55,580	00:28:57,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And the few men, I'm going to knock your internet offline. 
EDL	00:28:57,850	00:28:59,630	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And there's nothing you can do about it. 
EDL	00:28:59,630	00:29:04,070	| Radiolab_Darkode |	For what was something in a game, he could knock the game server that they were playing on offline,
EDL	00:29:04,070	00:29:05,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, stop their game.

EDL	00:29:48,840	00:29:49,680	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's the internet.

EDL	00:31:10,870	00:31:14,510	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It's kind of a place where hackers swap tips, brag like, hey, look what I did. 
EDL	00:31:14,510	00:31:20,006	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I deface this website, take a look, and he says one day he was talking with a coder friend of his guy named Izelda.
EDL	00:31:20,006	00:31:30,411	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Why don't we set up a community where we can really filter who gets to join and don't let all these script kiddies and idiots in, I actually chose the name.

EDL	00:31:54,460	00:31:57,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And at some point, I'm not too long after was created. 
EDL	00:31:57,320	00:32:01,410	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It was decided for one reason or another that, you know, we got all these programmers on here. 
EDL	00:32:01,410	00:32:05,960	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's great, but you know, they also want to be able to sell some of the stuff they're making. 
EDL	00:32:05,960	00:32:11,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So let's invite some people who would be willing to buy some of this stuff. 
EDL	00:32:11,790	00:32:13,330	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This now begins to sound like a fair. 
EDL	00:32:13,330	00:32:16,210	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You say I have a burglars tool. 
EDL	00:32:16,210	00:32:20,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Do you have a door, you want a burgle and then you have I'll rent you, my tool. 
EDL	00:32:20,110	00:32:21,340	| Radiolab_Darkode |	That's a simplification. 
EDL	00:32:21,340	00:32:29,930	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But yeah, people would post and say, I'm looking to buy X or here's this piece of software I created, here's all the things it does. 
EDL	00:32:29,930	00:32:35,620	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Here's some screenshots of it in action, and here's the price could be a certain type of botnet software. 
EDL	00:32:35,620	00:32:38,200	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It could be buying a botnet that itself. 
EDL	00:32:38,200	00:32:42,720	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know if you don't want to build one yourself, you want to buy one that somebody else already created and has going. 
EDL	00:32:42,720	00:32:47,650	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I mean, I can get you onto 200 or 20000 computers. 
EDL	00:32:47,650	00:32:49,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Just give me a check. 
EDL	00:32:49,160	00:32:51,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Yeah, what they called them were installs. 
EDL	00:32:51,470	00:33:00,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Installs, you know. Hey guys, I've got installs and they're 10 dollars per 1000, something like that. 
EDL	00:33:00,110	00:33:08,520	| Radiolab_Darkode |	This is something that is sort of surprising to us that when it comes to botnets that there's this whole rental market that's frighteningly affordable, it's bargain basement. 
EDL	00:33:08,520	00:33:11,460	| Radiolab_Darkode |	In fact, we were talking with one reporter, Kelly Jackson Higgins. 
EDL	00:33:11,460	00:33:16,240	| Radiolab_Darkode |	who's the executive editor of darkreading.com, which is a cyber security news site. 
EDL	00:33:16,240	00:33:16,590	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:33:16,590	00:33:23,820	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And she told us, you know, you can actually rent a botnet if you really wanted to, you could rent a botnet for one hour for about 38 dollars a month. 
EDL	00:33:23,820	00:33:26,780	| Radiolab_Darkode |	In some cases, as low as 20 dollars a month 
EDL	00:33:26,780	00:33:31,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I could rent a botnet for 20 bucks a month? You could. It's like renting space. 
EDL	00:33:31,110	00:33:38,880	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You wanna use this to go do damage somewhere or you want to make a statement or you have some plan for it or you want to send some spam here you go, you could go online right now. 
EDL	00:33:38,880	00:33:39,230	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:33:39,230	00:33:45,920	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And probably find somewhere out there on the net, somebody who will sell you access to computers for cents a piece. 
EDL	00:33:45,920	00:33:57,320	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And these are like people's computers like your computer, my computer and Dan says as Darkode got bigger and bigger, he began to see more of this kind of activity on the site, like some guy would have a botnet out of 5000 computers. 
EDL	00:33:57,320	00:34:04,325	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Another guy would have some software like the ransomware. Software guy would then rent the botnet from guy one, install his ransomware 
EDL	00:34:04,325	00:34:10,570	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Ransom these poor people then move on. You know, some of the people were, you know, doing some pretty unpleasant things, you know. 
EDL	00:34:10,570	00:34:20,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Moving more into the kind of financial crimes territory, which is something that I really never had a desire to be involved in, and it was largely because of that. 
EDL	00:34:20,280	00:34:23,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	He says that in 2009 he decided to get out. 
EDL	00:34:23,850	00:34:24,790	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:34:24,790	00:34:29,350	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But unfortunately, the next year, I got a lovely visit from the FBI. 
EDL	00:34:29,350	00:34:30,660	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:34:30,660	00:34:37,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	They promptly... Was it like kicked-down-in-your-door type situation? They knocked, they knocked. 
EDL	00:34:37,470	00:34:41,100	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So it what was that like, pretty terrifying. 
EDL	00:34:41,100	00:34:45,940	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, what's what's gonna happen to me, what's going to happen next? And what did happen next? 
EDL	00:34:45,940	00:34:48,400	| Radiolab_Darkode |	I don't know how much of that I can talk about. 
EDL	00:34:48,400	00:34:56,750	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But I did cooperate with the government, and I have cooperated with them for the last, you know, 5 plus years now. It was a kick in the butt. 
EDL	00:34:56,750	00:35:09,730	| Radiolab_Darkode |	You know, my parents kinda kicked me out, not that kicked me out, assisted me with a rapid move out. And I've been living on my own since then. 
EDL	00:35:09,730	00:35:20,950	| Radiolab_Darkode |	And ah, became gainfully employed, had a few jobs, um became a little bit more more serious with my then girlfriend, who was now my wife. 
EDL	00:35:20,950	00:35:27,570	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So, you know, it's given me an opportunity over the last five years to really make some serious changes to my life. 
EDL	00:35:27,570	00:35:29,740	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:35:29,740	00:35:45,840	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Meanwhile, over the same five years, Darkode grew into this massive cyber criminals swappy where tens of thousands of stolen social security numbers were bought and sold huge databases of personal information and emails were bought and sold malware and software,
EDL	00:35:45,840	00:35:54,757	| Radiolab_Darkode |	various kinds of botnets are sold. And this continued according to Dina Temple-Raston and right up until July 15th of this year, July 15th 2015. 
EDL	00:35:54,757	00:36:01,110	| Radiolab_Darkode |	Today marks a milestone in our efforts to bring to justice some of the most significant cyber criminals in the world. 
EDL	00:36:01,110	00:36:14,160	| Radiolab_Darkode |	What ended up happening on July 15th is that the FBI had actually gotten into Darkode with a number of intelligent services from around the world, and they had an 18 month investigation in which they took down in the end,
EDL	00:36:14,160	00:36:19,470	| Radiolab_Darkode |	28 people. The FBI has effectively smashed the hornet's nest
EDL	00:36:19,470	00:36:23,850	| Radiolab_Darkode |	and we are in the process of rounding up and charging the hornets. 
EDL	00:36:23,850	00:36:25,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	But here's here's what's amazing, right? 
EDL	00:36:25,500	00:36:32,280	| Radiolab_Darkode |	So they take down more than two dozen people two weeks later, Darkode is up again. 
EDL	00:36:32,280	00:36:33,690	| Radiolab_Darkode |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:36:33,690	00:36:35,500	| Radiolab_Darkode |	It just pop back up? Just pop back up.

Darkode
2022-1-14 | 38:34 |

It would seem that hackers today can do just about anything they want - from
turning on the cellphone in your pocket to holding your life's work hostage.
Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work
collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep
undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those
shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and
perpetrators.

First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about
being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a
world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting
accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.

Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative
professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union.
Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to
ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how
a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.
