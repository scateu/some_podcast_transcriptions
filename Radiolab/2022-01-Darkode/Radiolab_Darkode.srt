Particularly for something you'll see it a lot for freshness of credit cards because you know it's easy to say, you know, here are 10000 credit card numbers, but if they're credit card numbers, they've been out for a while and get declined, everybody, you've just wasted your money. 
抢劫吧？绝对的。特别是对于一些你会看到它很多的信用卡的新鲜度, 因为你知道这很容易说, 你知道, 这里有10000个信用卡号码, 但如果他们的信用卡号码, 他们已经出了一段时间, 得到拒绝, 大家, 你只是浪费了你的钱。

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:28,540
And, I think most people know silk road, and they know, for example, you could get a contract hit from silk road and drugs and guns and everything else, so would it be right for me to say that this was sort of a silk road for hackers?
而且, 我想大多数人都知道丝绸之路, 他们知道, 例如, 你可以从丝绸之路上获得合同的打击, 毒品和枪支和其他一切, 所以我说这是一种黑客的丝绸之路, 这是否正确？

Yeah, I wouldn't want to draw that direct comparison.

I think it's probably accurate. 
我认为这可能是准确的。

I would say that all measure of cybercrime you see and watch around the world was in some form of fashion connected to it. 
我想说的是, 你在世界各地看到的所有网络犯罪的措施都是以某种形式与之相关的。

据我们所知, 丹从未公开谈论过此事。那么, 你是如何参与Darkode的？嗯。

small middle class suburb right outside Milwaukee.

270
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:38,050
In fact, that sort of plays into the story because he says what he would do to sort of escape, he's go to the basement and play video games. 
事实上, 这也是故事的一部分, 因为他说他会做什么来逃避, 他会去地下室玩电子游戏。

So, yes, the stereotypical hacker in his parents' basement.

It's quite hilarious.

Dan says his hacking began innocently enough when he would monkey with games like Age of Empires. 
丹说, 他的黑客行为开始时是很无辜的, 他对《帝国时代》等游戏进行捣乱。

I changed the graphics, changed the artificial intelligence in the game,
我改变了图形, 改变了游戏中的人工智能。

275
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:09,557
the way it plays, rework it, create new maps, that type of thing um, something I enjoyed. And slowly throughout my teenage years that developed into something more, 
我改变了图形, 改变了游戏中的人工智能, 改变了它的玩法, 重新设计它, 创造新的地图, 这些都是我喜欢的东西。在我十几岁的时候, 慢慢地发展成更多的东西。

00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:15,250
I did not get along well with a lot of my peers in in great middle schools. 
在伟大的中学里, 我和很多同龄人相处得并不融洽。

277
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:26,320
So I spent um a lot more time on the computer and on myself than I did socially, at least at that age. And he says one day he was in,
所以我花了很多时间在电脑和自己身上, 而不是在社会上, 至少在那个年龄段。他说有一天他在。

278
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:35,180
A chat room and an Internet chat room was called game search, talking with a bunch of other people loved video games. And at some point along the way, he meets this guy. 
一个聊天室, 一个互联网聊天室被称为游戏搜索, 与其他一堆人交谈, 喜欢视频游戏。而在这一过程中的某个时刻, 他遇到了这个家伙。

279
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,020
You know, this particular guy was into, you know, botnets. 
你知道, 这个特别的家伙是成, 你知道, 僵尸网络。

280
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:49,260
Oh, yes, botnets, we all cry, just remind us, what's what's going on there? Botnets are you know, malware viruses installed on computers. 
哦, 是的, 僵尸网络, 我们都哭了, 只是提醒我们, 什么是怎么回事呢？僵尸网络是你知道的, 安装在电脑上的恶意软件病毒。

281
00:26:49,260 --> 00:27:02,739
And, botnets are the way to centrally control a whole lot of affected computers. Just to put this in context for saying, I think this is totally fascinating, Joseph Menn says this whole botnet situation started with spam. 
而且, 僵尸网络是集中控制一大批受影响的计算机的方式。只是为了把这个背景说出来, 我认为这是完全迷人的, 约瑟夫-门恩说这整个僵尸网络的情况始于垃圾邮件。

282
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:12,700
One of the easiest ways to make money on the internet back to 2000 was spam. Spam is, in an opinion extensions, and i'm in Nairobi. 
早在2000年, 互联网上最容易赚钱的方法之一就是垃圾邮件。垃圾邮件是, 在一个意见扩展, 我在内罗毕。

283
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,100
What happened was that in the olden days, most servers, mail servers, acted as open relays. 
发生的事情是, 在过去的日子里, 大多数服务器, 邮件服务器, 作为开放的继电器。

284
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,160
Meaning the mail people wouldn't really pay attention to who was sending, so the spammers with. 
意思是说, 人们不会真正注意到谁在发送, 所以垃圾邮件发送者。

285
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Spam with abandon. And then spammers got to be enough of a problem that the techies of the world decided that's it. 
垃圾邮件被抛弃了。然后, 垃圾邮件发送者成为一个足够的问题, 世界上的技术人员决定, 这是它。

286
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:41,330
They started to block people like if they found a guy who they thought was sending too many product emails or whatever, they would block his IP address so that he couldn't send any more mail. 
他们开始阻止人们, 比如他们发现一个人, 他们认为他发送了太多的产品邮件或其他东西, 他们会阻止他的IP地址, 这样他就不能再发送任何邮件。

287
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:50,010
So what the spammers and their contractors then needed to do was to have a bunch of clean IP addresses and send spam. 
因此, 垃圾邮件发送者和他们的承包商需要做的是拥有一堆干净的IP地址并发送垃圾邮件。

288
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:59,400
From that, so what they did, which is totally genius, totally evil, is they hired a bunch of programmers to create a bunch of viruses, disseminated (传播) those viruses across the internet. 
因此, 他们所做的, 完全是天才的, 完全是邪恶的, 是他们雇用了一群程序员来创造一堆病毒, 在互联网上传播这些病毒。

289
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,750
Accidentally click or open something to get them onto their computer. 
不小心点击或打开一些东西, 让他们进入自己的电脑。

290
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:16,902
And then suddenly the spammers could now remote control our computers at a distance, whatever they wanted for maybe just an hour or two a night to send out their spam because these were clean IP addresses. 
然后突然间, 垃圾邮件发送者现在可以远程控制我们的电脑, 不管他们想做什么, 也许只是每晚一两个小时来发送他们的垃圾邮件, 因为这些是干净的IP地址。

291
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:26,390
Of course, what happened is that once the spammers had these botnets, they started thinking, hey, I could do something else with this, and the next thing that came along was denial of service attacks. 
当然, 发生的事情是, 一旦垃圾邮件发送者拥有这些僵尸网络, 他们开始思考, 嘿, 我可以用这个做别的事情, 接下来出现的事情是拒绝服务攻击。

292
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:39,340
You can have all of them try to contact Ebay.com at the same time, and knock over Ebay. This first gentleman that I ran into, so he had a botnet of well over 1000 computers, which you know at the time was amazing to me. 
你可以让所有的人同时尝试联系Ebay.com, 并打翻Ebay。我遇到的第一位先生, 所以他有一个超过1000台电脑的僵尸网络, 你知道在当时对我来说是惊人的。

293
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,590
You know, by today's standards of thousands for a botnet, that is, is nothing. 
你知道, 以今天的标准, 一个僵尸网络有几千台, 那是, 什么都不是。

294
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,020
Now they can get up into the millions. 
现在他们可以达到数百万台。

295
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:55,580
But um, you know, back then, it was quite incredible to me. And because he says he was in this chat room, this guy was there and this guy would get into fights with people. And any time he did, he'd point his 1000 computer drone army at that enemy. 
但是, 嗯, 你知道, 在当时, 这对我来说是相当不可思议的。因为他说他在这个聊天室里, 这个家伙在那里, 这个家伙会和人打架。而任何时候, 他都会把他的1000台电脑无人机军队对准那个敌人。

296
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,850
And the few men, I'm going to knock your internet offline. 
而那几个人, 我要把你的网络打掉。

297
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,630
And there's nothing you can do about it. 
而你对此无能为力。

298
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,070
For what was something in a game, he could knock the game server that they were playing on offline,
对于游戏中的东西, 他可以把他们正在玩的游戏服务器打掉。

299
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,350
You know, stop their game. 
你知道, 停止他们的游戏。

300
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,500
Things like that. 
像这样的事情。

301
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:16,070
It's like you can take away his ball back in, 1935. That is exactly it, taking away someone else's ball over the Internet, this for some reason, intrigued you. 
这就像你可以拿走他的球回来, 1935年。这正是它, 在互联网上夺走别人的球, 这出于某种原因, 让你很感兴趣。

302
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,760
Yes, was amazing to me. 
是的, 对我来说很神奇。

303
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm like you have control of 1000 computers. 
我就像你控制了1000台电脑。

304
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,110
Wow, you know how how did you do this. At the time, I had never heard of botnets. 
哇, 你知道你是如何做到这一点的。当时, 我从未听说过僵尸网络。

305
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:37,990
I didn't know about any of this stuff, like how did you, how did you get the software to do this? how did you get it onto all these computers. And he was quite happy to tell you all that? Oh, he certainly was particular gentleman, had a very large ego. 
我不知道这些东西, 比如你是怎么做到的, 你是怎么得到这个软件的, 你是怎么把它放到所有这些电脑上的。他很乐意告诉你这一切？哦, 他肯定是特别的绅士, 有一个非常大的自我。

306
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,760
And did you see him as a bad guy?
你认为他是个坏人吗？

Yeah, to be honest, I think at that age, I didn't really think about it that deeply. 
是的, 说实话, 我认为在那个年龄段, 我并没有真正深入思考这个问题。

308
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,680
It's the internet.

309
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,960
It's it's a lot harder to do.

310
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,920
Um kind of quantify right and wrong there. 
嗯一种量化的权利和错误。

311
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,370
I mean, now, it's easy to look back at that and say, yeah. 
我的意思是, 现在, 这很容易回头看, 说, 是的。

312
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,830
This is wrong, but it's not like going up to someone and punching them in the face. 
这是不对的, 但它不像走到别人面前, 打他们的脸。

313
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,360
There's no human connection there.

You don't see these people or feel these people.

315
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:15,510
He says at the time, it was just sheer (十足) curiosity. So he says he asked this pied piper guy to send him some of the bot software that made the botnet go. And, 
他说, 当时, 这只是纯粹的（十足）好奇。所以他说, 他要求这个吹笛人给他发送一些僵尸软件, 使僵尸网络的发展。而且。

316
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,910
that really intrigued me, you know, digging through the source code,
这真的让我很感兴趣, 你知道, 通过源代码的挖掘。

317
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:25,060
trying to understand what is this thing doing, how does it work, how does it tick? This guy, was he a good coder? Like, was he good at it?
试图了解这个东西在做什么, 它是如何工作的, 它是如何运作的？这个人, 他是一个好的编码员吗？比如, 他擅长这个吗？

318
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:39,920
No, no, I would, you know, in hindsight (事后聪明) now he's what I would classify as a script kiddie, you know someone script kiddie. 
不, 不, 我会, 你知道, 在事后聪明）现在他是什么, 我会归类为一个脚本的孩子, 你知道有人脚本的孩子。

So a script kiddie is is someone who has just enough technical ability to uh. 
因此, 一个脚本kiddie是一个人谁拥有足够的技术能力, 呃。

嗯, 那种采取一些工具和软件, 其他人已经创建, 只是使用它们。

321
00:30:50,900 --> 00:31:05,370
Now to fast forward. As Dan went the opposite direction of the script kiddies and got better and better and started making these botnets that could literally spy on people as they were using their computers. Interesting to see all the porn that people were watching, that type of thing. 
现在要快进了。由于丹走的是与脚本小子相反的方向, 并且变得越来越好, 开始制作这些僵尸网络, 可以从字面上监视人们使用他们的计算机。有意思的是, 看到人们正在观看的所有色情内容, 这种类型的东西。

322
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,870
He says he found himself in another chat room, that was called bot talk. 
他说, 他发现自己在另一个聊天室, 这被称为机器人谈话。

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,510
It's kind of a place where hackers swap tips, brag like, hey, look what I did. 
这是一种地方, 黑客交换技巧, 吹嘘像, 嘿, 看我做了什么。

324
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,006

他说, 有一天, 他和他的一个名叫Izelda的编码员朋友聊天。

325
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:30,411
Why don't we set up a community where we can really filter who gets to join and don't let all these script kiddies and idiots in, I actually chose the name. 
我们为什么不建立一个社区, 在那里我们可以真正过滤谁可以加入, 不要让所有这些脚本儿童和白痴加入, 实际上是我选择了这个名字。

00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:32,540
I came up with that nice, lame name.

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,500
So we chose the name and started getting the site set up. 
所以我们选择了这个名字并开始建立网站。

The rules where it would be invited only so you had to, and each new person would be required to demonstrate their skill. 
它的规则是只接受邀请, 所以你必须, 而且每个新来的人都需要展示他们的技能。

由于这样或那样的原因决定, 你知道, 我们在这里得到了所有这些程序员。

这是伟大的, 但你知道, 他们也希望能够出售一些他们所做的东西。

这是一个简化的说法。

342
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:29,930

但是, 是的, 人们会发帖说, 我想买X, 或者这是我创造的这块软件, 这是它的所有功能。

350
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:08,520
This is something that is sort of surprising to us that when it comes to botnets that there's this whole rental market that's frighteningly affordable, it's bargain basement. 
这是一种让我们感到惊讶的东西, 当涉及到僵尸网络时, 有这样一个完整的租赁市场, 它是可怕的实惠, 它是便宜的。

351

In fact, we were talking with one reporter, Kelly Jackson Higgins. 
事实上, 我们正在与一位记者凯利-杰克逊-希金斯交谈。

我可以用20块钱一个月租一个僵尸网络？你可以。这就像租借空间。

356
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:38,880
You wanna use this to go do damage somewhere or you want to make a statement or you have some plan for it or you want to send some spam here you go, you could go online right now. 
你想用这个去破坏某个地方, 或者你想发表一个声明, 或者你有一些计划, 或者你想发送一些垃圾邮件, 在这里你去, 你可以现在就上网。

And probably find somewhere out there on the net, somebody who will sell you access to computers for cents a piece. 
可能会发现在网络上的某个地方, 有人会以几分钱一台的价格向你出售电脑的使用权。

358
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:57,320

这些都是人们的电脑, 如你的电脑, 我的电脑和丹说, 随着Darkode变得越来越大, 他开始看到更多的这种活动的网站上, 像一些家伙会有一个僵尸网络的5000台电脑。

Another guy would have some software like the ransomware. Software guy would then rent the botnet from guy one, install his ransomware 
另一个人将有一些软件, 如赎金软件。然后, 软件的家伙会从一个家伙那里租用僵尸网络, 安装他的勒索软件。

360

Ransom these poor people then move on. You know, some of the people were, you know, doing some pretty unpleasant things, you know. 
赎金这些可怜的人, 然后继续前进。你知道, 有些人, 你知道, 做一些相当不愉快的事情, 你知道。

361

Moving more into the kind of financial crimes territory, which is something that I really never had a desire to be involved in, and it was largely because of that. 
更多的是进入金融犯罪领域, 这是我真的从来没有想过要参与的事情, 主要是因为这个原因。

他说, 在2009年, 他决定退出。

但不幸的是, 第二年, 我得到了联邦调查局的一个可爱的访问。

他们迅速... 是像踢倒在你的门的类型的情况？他们敲门了, 他们敲门了。

So it what was that like, pretty terrifying. 
因此, 它是什么样子的, 相当可怕的。

366

You know, what's what's gonna happen to me, what's going to happen next? And what did happen next? 
你知道, 什么是什么会发生在我身上, 接下来会发生什么？接下来确实发生了什么？

I don't know how much of that I can talk about. 
我不知道我可以谈多少这方面的事情。

368
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:56,750
But I did cooperate with the government, and I have cooperated with them for the last, you know, 5 plus years now. It was a kick in the butt. 
但我确实与政府合作了, 而且在过去的五年多时间里, 我一直与他们合作。这是在屁股上踢了一脚。

369
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:09,730
You know, my parents kinda kicked me out, not that kicked me out, assisted me with a rapid move out. And I've been living on my own since then. 
你知道, 我的父母有点把我踢出去, 不是说把我踢出去, 而是协助我迅速搬出去。从那时起, 我一直自己生活。

370

而且啊, 变得有收益的就业, 有几份工作, 嗯, 和我当时的女朋友, 也就是现在的妻子, 变得有点更认真了。

So, you know, it's given me an opportunity over the last five years to really make some serious changes to my life. 
所以, 你知道, 在过去五年里, 它给了我一个机会, 使我的生活真正有了一些严重的变化。

372
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:45,840
Meanwhile, over the same five years, Darkode grew into this massive cyber criminals swappy where tens of thousands of stolen social security numbers were bought and sold huge databases of personal information and emails were bought and sold malware and software,
同时, 在同样的五年里, Darkode成长为这个巨大的网络犯罪分子的交换点, 成千上万的被盗社会安全号码被购买和出售巨大的个人信息和电子邮件数据库被购买和出售恶意软件和软件。

373
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:54,757

各种各样的僵尸网络被出售。而根据迪娜-坦普尔-拉斯顿的说法, 这种情况一直持续到今年的7月15日, 即2015年7月15日。

Today marks a milestone in our efforts to bring to justice some of the most significant cyber criminals in the world. 
今天是我们将世界上最重要的一些网络罪犯绳之以法的努力的一个里程碑。

375
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:14,160
What ended up happening on July 15th is that the FBI had actually gotten into Darkode with a number of intelligent services from around the world, and they had an 18 month investigation in which they took down in the end,
7月15日最终发生的事情是, 联邦调查局实际上已经与来自世界各地的一些智能服务机构进入了Darkode, 他们进行了18个月的调查, 最后他们拿下了。

28人。联邦调查局已经有效地捣毁了大黄蜂的巢穴

而我们正在围捕和指控大黄蜂的过程中。

But here's here's what's amazing, right? 
但这里是这里是惊人的, 对吗？
