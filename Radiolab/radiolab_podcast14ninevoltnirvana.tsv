EDL	00:00:06,400	00:00:10,240	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:12,288	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Radiolab
EDL	00:00:13,312	00:00:17,152	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	From WNYC
EDL	00:00:17,920	00:00:19,200	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And NPR
EDL	00:00:20,480	00:00:24,576	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Is Radiolab a I'm Jedi from rod iron Robert krulwich I'm Soren wheeler
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:25,600	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And this
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:34,816	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Do you want to say that okay
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:40,960	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I didn't hear anyone can I hear anyone oh my God
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,288	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	She's a
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:50,432	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Old friend of mine went to school together long time ago but these days she's an editor at New Scientist
EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	In London because of
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:56,320	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What happened to her when she was working on
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:01:02,720	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Story for them this was a story that I've been chasing for years and years for her in 2007
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:04,000	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	At DARPA Tech
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:10,400	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Which is a big Gathering of like weapons developers and researchers it's like 5000
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's from The Matrix you know looking at the
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The latest war toys drones Bazookas anyway at some point she starts talking to this woman and she was telling me about
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Her program which was that they had figured out how to apply for electrical current
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,016	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To the brain in order to
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,040	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Accelerate the learning process
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:34,464	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I was like no sweat Sally it stumbled into a something called PDC
EDL	00:01:34,464	00:01:36,768	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	DS games for transcranial Direct
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Current stimulation
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Daddy is
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You take a couple little
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:46,752	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Electrodes are placed on your scalp connected with wires to a battery you send a little bit of electricity into your brain and
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Then
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	All kinds of things happen
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	If you believe the claims
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,872	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:55,712	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Porcelli started with a casual afternoon of
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Sniper training
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So after that
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:02,624	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Conversation with a conference she tracked down a group in Carlsbad California
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	About an hour and a half south of La using this brain zapping stuff to train snipers
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I actually got new scientist agreed send me to LA from London which is not an insignificant
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Expense after a late night international flight in some LA traffic
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Stuff at a place called Advanced Brain Monitoring
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,360	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Where they have
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Little room little room where they set up a little sort of
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	360 degree training simulation to kind of like a video game
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But it's like the full
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,696	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Kind of like the full room in front of you
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And so wall is a screen
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Yes. She says but all around you in this room are these
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,656	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Props your behind real sandbags
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know in proper position they teach you how to hold the rifle properly and rifled except for the fact that it shoots blanks is basically the
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,104	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Real deal yeah and then Scott a laser
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Laser sight they told you know
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:00,224	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Okay before we do this brain stimulation thing we're actually going to have you
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You do some training without it so they
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:06,368	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Get her all set up they put her behind the sandbags and they hit cup
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It starts out with really easy stuff like you're shooting virtual Target that aren't
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Kickback from the CO2 cartridge and then you get this like sound from when you hit you know the virtual metal Target and then it starts getting hot
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:27,360	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Carter so there's people instead of targets and and more and more people until the highest level is you are at at
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:33,760	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Point Rocky checkpoint and everything's fine and then all sudden
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Humvee in front of you blows up and then from all over the place up dozens of people in suicide
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:46,560	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Start running at you with air rifle shooting you and I'm just
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Being blown
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Stop I can't
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:57,056	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I can't make the decisions fast enough or just too many of them she couldn't figure out who to shoot first it was so
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I'm so tired and I'm so jet-lagged and I was so bad at it and it's funny because you think like or whatever
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What's the video game
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's amazing how
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,320	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Stress ball that gets in a certain point
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Stress
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Started getting
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:13,696	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Stop let's just end this start thinking like
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:19,583	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	How am I doing here anyway like oh my God this is going to be a story and really you just flew out to California for the
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	She was not very good at in that kind of stressed her out and then this guy walked in the room
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Yes likewise
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Mike weisend neuroscience
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It looks like Gregg Allman
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Super long hair and fairly clean cut at the moment but I had hair down to my belt buckle
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Mike weisend has put together this
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Contraption what is the big boxes sitting in your lap
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	There's a big red
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Tool box that we got literally from Sears Mike was actually passing through New York city so we invited him into the studio
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,743	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	We have electrodes
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That allows to deliver current you legit wires a song and a whole bunch of batter
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So we take
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	A set of electrodes one electrode is attached
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	2 mi
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Right
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Temple
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,895	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And the other electrode is attached by different wire to my
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Left
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Darned we turn on the juice
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Did it hurt it wasn't so much that I suddenly tasted metal in my mouth tasted tasted like I'd like to
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The inside of an aluminum can and then he's like
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,303	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I'm not exactly expecting different results
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,327	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Today's date
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Start me out again right at the really hard checkpoint 1 the thing blows up
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And then people start coming from all over the place
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I feel like they must have put it on an easy setting
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Everything is just a little more straightforward it's more obvious who I should pick off first
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I'm thinking to myself a little bit like
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know when it's going to get really hard again
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And then
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know intern or whoever comes in and turns on the lights
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,887	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	She's like okay you're done Michael wait
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's not that's not
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I've only been here for like 3 minutes
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That was 20 minutes
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:07,103	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Like no that's not true and I look up in the clocks of all shifted by 20 minutes
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I swear to God it was 3 minutes almost every person that would put this on so they get into what they call us
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	State of
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Hello
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Where they don't recognize of the time is going by there just boom boom boom boom
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I was like did you guys make it easier Stellino same
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Same level
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I think you guys made it easier when Sally did it with
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Brain stimulation
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	She performed at 100%
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	100%
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I didn't leave anyone alive
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	How what was she before
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:43,455	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I don't know but she wasn't very good at roughly 3 out of 20 of the first time in
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,735	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	20th 20th
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So you're saying with just a little electricity she went from being like totally an app to
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Train killer
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Mountain end of one so we can't go too far but I mean this was just Sally's experience during this one.
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Sound like a controlled study
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But Mike has now use this device in a bunch of studies
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Military had one city with people looking at those black and white
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,311	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Radar in
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Trying to pick out you know
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:17,503	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What's an enemy vehicle and what isn't and if he puts this device on their head while they're trying to learn how to
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To do that we can double the rate of learning
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Really
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Wow what is it doing
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Okay so what I think is that early on when you are learning Something Mike says that when you're trying to learn how to do something is kind of
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What's happening is that your
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Trying a bunch of different things
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You try all kinds of different ways to solve the problem
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	He usually your brain is stumbling across
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:40,543	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Ideal
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Sequence of neurons every so often as you're practicing all sent your brain is like
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Okay that's it
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:54,879	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But then it struggles to find that again it keeps messing up and whatever and if you look at an expert brain you actually see
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	See that preferred circuit dialed in
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Like they just do that over and over and over again no more stumbling around until what mic does he figured out
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Where that circuit is and he gives it a little extra
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Juice to an innocent
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,567	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Prime the pump
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So that that expert circuit
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Is more likely to fire
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And you're more likely to stumble into it and when you do stumble into it you're more likely to stick with it that's right
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's how
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	We think it works
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Where are you are you sure what you're hitting I mean like you're putting electricity on the outs
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Side of
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	People's heads
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Are you able to Target
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,327	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Just a small cluster of brain cells or
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Is it a region that you're hitting or like
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Thousand cell phone number
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's out that's a lot
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Is that precise enough
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	2
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To Target
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The place where a task is being done in a brain If it's a million
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	An artwork yes
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Am I claims that even though it's a blunt tool this is not a scalpel this is a sledgehammer
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	If you know the right
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Group of neurons are region of the brain to Target
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This can work with almost any task
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	If you want to Target
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Visual-spatial learning for example searching an image
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You put this on the right
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Decide
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Of your head roughly near the temple
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But if you wanted to learn text you on material you can put this on the left
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Side of your head and it will have a similar effect
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Do you want to learn text from here Beach
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	If I'm if I want to learn irregular verbs in French
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I keep getting your things I stick another part of my hair but as good of a grammar we haven't tested it with learning for inline
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Languages for native English speakers learning a long English Center
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	They can recall it with greater fidelity
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	If they have this on their head while they
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Study listen
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And if you go right parietal

EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	We are all kind of like
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I don't know
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But since my cat has a vice there with him should we try it

EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:04,575	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:08,927	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To you
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	No matter what it just seems like
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The next
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Flavor of new age
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Think so
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Started calling around my name is Peter Reiner and I'm professor at the University of British Columbia
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So Peter actually
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Studies this whole field
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Keep WhatsApp public perception in the quality of research and I just
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Basically asked aminos
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	For real like if you have a healthy brain you put a little
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Electricity into a has it been proven that that will enhance learning or whatever else they claim
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Well
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe the best way to answer that it is that
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,375	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Part of the reason that there is all this interests
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Set tdcs
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Christy Ralph
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Effective
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Because this is based on a lot of different studies in a lot of different areas such a key to what I just said is relative
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So the caveat that I have to add is that
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Much all of the studies
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,551	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That have been done today.
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Relatively small
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	He says it's
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Early days in the studies have been done have only been done with a few such a
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe 20 people
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Larger study
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,535	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	40 or 50
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Now these days to find a positive effect but if you're a hard-nosed scientist
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know those small sample sizes Aren't Enough
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To make a very big claim
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Even so
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Cats
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Kind of already out of the bag cuz if you go on YouTube
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Really brief
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,735	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Really quick
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's cool you can find a surprisingly large number of videos of
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	People experimenting with these devices
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I instantly feel very
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Good
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Very
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Converse
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Saying it's not really worried about anyting videos show you how to make your own

EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's going to be your 9 volt
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Alligator clips since I don't have any starter with me although I have a switch in the circuit YouTube Jessie
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Be filled with people who are trying to hotwire their own brain
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Howard Zinn
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I have probably below average rainfall compared to normal people
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I want
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Starting your Sciences but as many of you I don't have the resources to go to school right now
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	To do is I like to use tdcs
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	While I'm learning my
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Vocabulary list I want to give you an update on
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	How to learn a foreign language
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Which people are using this
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Thanksgiving how flexible
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's Nick fits he works with Peter Runner the guy we talked to her earlier and he says not only can you do a lot of different kinds of things
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This device on top of that
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Dirt cheap
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The time that it takes me to listen to one of your episodes
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I can probably go to the store
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Come back and build a tdcs device around $20
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	$20
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I said something that makes you nervous
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I'll say first I think the DIY Community is quite
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But it does make me nervous that some people react report loss of consciousness after using it
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Healing Burns
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	There's actually one report of somebody going temporarily blind
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This guy on YouTube young Asian kid wear
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Where which places are my head would improve memory about how he spent a year Canada
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Experimenting with it he put it in one place and after about 5 minutes
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I started to really like really angry and depressed
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Put in another place
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,151	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Tellagami a really high score on Lumosity
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I've only been stimulating my brain
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's like he's playing Russian roulette with
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Which brings up a larger point you know that
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Lit devices
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Possibly hard to regulate
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The kid like this can put it anywhere he wants in his head and if he moves it just a couple of inches
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It could have a
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:44,607	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Drastically different effect and that's really what
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Is a
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Because according to Peter Reiner
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Well we might like to think of the brain as
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Was being a bunch of separate
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Circus
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Except
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Tasks
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Really
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's a Neko
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Every part affects every other part
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	In some way and when you put your electrodes on head
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You affecting serious small area of the brain right under the electrodes but it's already been shown that
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's perfect can bed multiply and spread throughout the nervous system even down to your spinal
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	There's a theory out there is called the zero-sum theory of the brain that some people use
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Framework for thinking about all this which is like
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	No one part goes up another part goes like there's only so much juice in the brain so if you
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Send juice One Direction there's less juice somewhere else and a su then if you were enhancing one part year by definition
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Diminishing another
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe be honest it was definitely in After Effects
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Kind of why
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I ended up talking to Sally about
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This why I got so interested in this
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	He's in the first place
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This is because
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What happened to her
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	After the snap
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	For training so
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Driving down from LA to Carlsbad
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Citgo
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Do this
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Was an absolute nightmare I hadn't driven in like a year cuz I've been living in London where I just do public transportation
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,783	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But on the way up
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's kind of like
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Negative compared to Mario Kart but it's
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Extremely pleasant experience
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I feel like I drove better that day than I ever drove before
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I think it was very obvious where I
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Capaz people without
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Irritating them and I don't know it's a weird
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The weird memory but I think I had more fun driving
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That day than I ever did
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Since
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And some point she realized it wasn't just about her driving a bit
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I would say that
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I mean I don't know how much I want to get into sort of in public on the radio
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	About
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know being a bit anxious
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,303	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I guess that's not particularly controversial
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Probably all writers
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,655	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Liquor should have riddled with anxiety but you know I have
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	This
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Constant
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Struggle with all the little
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Angry gnomes in my head
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know populating my head and telling me I like all the things that I don't do right
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know all the things that I've done wrong that day they
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Keep this incredibly like
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Comprehensive Taliesin
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And then you know if they want to worry about the future than you know the ones who tell me I'm going to be living in a cardboard box
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I mean it's just like an amazing
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Cacophony
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	But she says
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Sitting in that car they were they were just completely turned off I think
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	For a couple of days
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And it was a really
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,080	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	For a couple days or couple of days and to tell you the truth
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,104	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's kind of like everything just
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:36,896	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	I was just this
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:39,200	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Person that I hadn't
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Experience before and I thought
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Actual start of core person who I am
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	When all my baggage isn't just
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It was like somebody had died
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What's a really steamy window
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Able to look at the world for what it was
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Curious weather like
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,312	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	There's a connection there that like
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:07,872	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Good
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Former
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:14,016	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Goes along with shutting down
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The parts of yourself that say I don't know I don't think maybe I can't
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe I shouldn't
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:22,464	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And that's like there's actually a real connection between
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,536	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Amping up one and tamping down the other
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Makes sense if you take giving one circuit more power you might be taken away from other place
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's funny I mean it does I find this like you know since you and I are just been on stage
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	One of the things I struggle with most
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	During the performances has been sitting there with busting there we've got our Scripts
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And I have the
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Box of buttons and afternoon which buttons
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What things and there's like the musician.
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Restaurant where they come in and out
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And all of these things
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	They become competing voices
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	They become visible
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:55,232	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Shattering
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Gnomes the Sally pussy
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	State of my head
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:00,608	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What is a Hellcat Network when does that come in where are we
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Come on
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Why you keep doing and I get like kind of crazy
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:10,080	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	So I can't actually even focus
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	What you're saying
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's not a good feeling and then there are other times where something happens almost like a mode
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And suddenly it's like
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Right there I know I'm right with you
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It's the easiest thing in the world to listen to what you're saying and respond instinctively and in the moment
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	And it literally feel like different
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Chemical mode
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe electrical mode
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:32,352	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's really that's
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	That's very
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Maybe cuz I'm going back to the performance stuff
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	You can't really
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	Make it

EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It doesn't feel that way it feels like
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	It somehow feels like it's a gift

EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast14ninevoltnirvana |	The world where you think you deserve things are you think you've earned them or you think other people have an agree with that completely.
