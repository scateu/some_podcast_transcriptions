EDL	00:00:03,328	00:00:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Quick heads up
EDL	00:00:04,608	00:00:07,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	This episode contains some graphic language and descriptions of
EDL	00:00:07,936	00:00:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Very sensitive sexual
EDL	00:00:09,984	00:00:10,752	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Situations
EDL	00:00:10,752	00:00:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Including discussions of sex
EDL	00:00:12,288	00:00:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Consent and accountability
EDL	00:00:14,080	00:00:14,848	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You might be married if
EDL	00:00:16,896	00:00:17,920	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Are you awake

EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab today we have parked
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:38,144	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	2
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Of a three-part series that we're calling in the know
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:42,496	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	No as in an o
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	We were inspired to do this
EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	After hearing a set of stories
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,664	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	On the show called The Heart produced by Kaitlin Prest
EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Last week we played excerpts
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Of that series
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And if you haven't heard of last week's episode I would encourage you to go back and listen
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:00,416	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is the stories that Caitlin told
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	We got some very intense reactions
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For my license online all over the map
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Have you feeling those stories that you made are a very
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Striking
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:12,960	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Personal view of
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Consent from the inside
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Now it just so happens that Caitlin
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Produce those stories
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In the spring of 2017
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Spring just before
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	All the accusations started hitting the news
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	First against Harvey Weinstein and then
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Congressman like
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Al Franken
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Actors like Kevin Spacey
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Medians
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And then in many cases the very people very men who are reporting about those stories
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And much of what made it into the news with pretty clear-cut
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Criminal cases
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:45,728	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Or accusations of
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Clear breaches
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Consent but then we started to hear about
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The cases that were harder
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Not explicitly
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Criminal
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	More nuanced
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,272	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That Gray Zone
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Which Caitlin was
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Exploring herpes
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It occurred to us like a dick this is a conversation we're all trying to have right now
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:13,120	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So what we started doing the wave listening to her stories was doing a series of interviews of our own with people
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	All over the map
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Who are thinking and rethinking consent in interesting ways will play a couple of the next two weeks but we ran into one
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Particular
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Interview
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	See if it's working Kaitlyn you there yes I'm here
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That we could not
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Stop thinking about
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Santa created a lot of really difficult conversations internally
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And so we just kind of decided why don't we play this thing relatively
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Raw
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	We don't do very often but let's just put it out
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	More or less how it happened in all of its flaws
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Kaitlyn Kaylee can you hurry Hannah
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yes it's out it's Hannah
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Hannah okay sorry Caitlin could you here hun I'm speaking can you hear me yes I can hear you

EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Both of you guys
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Thank you really glad to be here okay so since I'm already pronounce her name incorrectly can you tell me who you are
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How to say your name what you do
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sure my name is Hannah stotland
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm an independent consultant I work on
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sorry I'm an independent educational consultant
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:20,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I specialize in
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Educational crisis management
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Particular vantage point
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	On this whole set of questions
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When I see a
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Unfamiliar number from a distant area code on my phone
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And if I can I pick that up
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And it happens quite regularly. I pick it up and I just here sobbing
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's a mom whose kid just got expelled
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So that happens
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Regularly
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	More like
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Once or twice a month
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Often the calls are coming from moms whose sons have been accused of some kind of sexual misconduct
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I got my first two calls on that topic
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In January of 2014
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And since then it's grown and grown and grown about a third of my work now
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm is students who are involved with
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Title Nine in one way or another
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Title Nine is a federal law that deals with
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Among other things
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,232	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sexual harassment sexual violence on college campuses
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What Hannah will do when she gets these calls it she'll work with these young men
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Havana Cuba
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To get them back into school
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	By the school they were in
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,007	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But more often it means transferring to a different School
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So families hire me to help their
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Kids get into a college or grad school usually
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I think it is a good thing
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When people in general
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Even people who may have done something very bad
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Who want education can continue to get education
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	As long as they're seeking it honest
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What if you but what if you're then just deferring the problem is some of the campus I mean let's say there's a guy who
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Victimize somebody
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And then you help him get to another College where maybe they do it again
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Well that they be in the community one way or another and I think this is an area where I
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	See a lot of problems with
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Classism
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And probably racism to
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	We're we're so concerned about that accused person being on another college campus
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	If he isn't on a college campus where do you think he's going to be
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Cuz he's not going to jail
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The student said we're talkin about typically the police don't even get called but if they do they come and see
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The evidence to say this evidence is so thin
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know we're not we're not even going to impose charges
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Saiino okay well he's not going to college anymore he's going to work at McDonald's and so if there's a risk to that fellow people at McDonald's and weed
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You just don't care
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Because they're not the upper middle-class white women who were actually worried about
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	On the college campus
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I have misgivings about the ideas at
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Did the
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	College students are special needs
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Community needs special attention that other young adults don't need
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So you're interested so that I know that I have your point of view that I understand it
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is that you don't
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's not that you
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Don't sink
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But some people should be
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Spelled sometimes
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Oh sure they sure that yeah okay
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I feel very comfortable
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	With the idea that
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	People who want to continue their education
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Audi be able to make their case
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,335	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Friday
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Want to continue it
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What I do
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is help them talk about what happened
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So if you're interested in covering it up or hiding it
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There's no reason to hire me
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I hope you have that hard conversation or write that difficult essay
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	About what went wrong
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Even if
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You feel you were wrongly accused
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You were railroaded by the school
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You better find
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Unwise choices that you made
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Selfish choices that you made
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:12,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There are not a lot of these cases where I think well you handled everything perfectly you didn't make any
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Risk preferring choices
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There's nothing you could change
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To keep this from happening to you in the future
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You still have to tell a story
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	About mistakes that you made
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,951	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And how you're working to fix
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How does that go I mean do you find that
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	People will maintain that like will they sort of hold on to the idea that they did have consent even if the other person says
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But they didn't
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And imma try my Facebook
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm not necessarily trying to change their mind about whether they had consent
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That means they were there and I was not
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	At the City Museum
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It in a scenario where you have both sides of the story
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What's the usual difference
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It depends there's a few cases where the stories just are incompatible
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But there are
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Most of my cases
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The dispute is narrow
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Everybody agrees that the encounter was
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Generally consensual
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Either the consent to all of it was withdrawn
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	According to the Accuser
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Or there was consensus to access A and B but not C
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And see just happened before they knew it and
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There wasn't a conversation about it and
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	One party feels that c was
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Arepa
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Or that snow I agree I acted like I wanted this the whole time and maybe even I said yes
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But in retrospect I was too drunk or high
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And that. Consent was no good and nullifies Atkins
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	At this point in the conversation we talked a little bit about like
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,087	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The different kinds of cancer
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What works like affirmative consent
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Marissa Bell
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Clear
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Permission often verbal permission that can be withdrawn at any time which Hannah says she is all 4000%
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Question is if you don't do it is it rape
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's the dichotomy that I object to
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Or I'm a skeptic about I should say I mean if if
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Again if people can show me that this works and I'm interested but when you say I guess that's a thing like when you say if
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	People can show me if this work
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Can you cut sirloin pack what you mean by that like
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Let me get it seems so clear to me that it does work
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Let me tell you a few stories there's a couple that I can give more identifying information about because
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That this
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The case is in litigation now and so that's on the public record and the fact that I'm involved in the case is on the public record so I
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I can say a few more things
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,151	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Facetune
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	He had a girl wearing his room
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	After party they didn't know each other well
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	He touched her private parts
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And there was vaginal penetration
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	With his fingers
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Both parties agree
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That he asked for and got affirmative verbal consent
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	He said do you like this and she said yes
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And she faked an orgasm
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Both parties are telling the exact same story
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And he was found responsible for sexual assault cuz she says I didn't mean it I said yes I was enjoying it
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In order to get it over with faster
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:36,159	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I wanted a graceful way to leave his room and I saw it
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Making him think I was having an orgasm
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Would would help me get out of there more gracefully without being rude
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And he will have to see that Monday for two and a half years I'll let you finish I'll let you finish and then I'll say what I think
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Close my my
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I mean this
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's that's when singing practice
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know it's it's
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Other other cases that I've seen
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is someone who basically my my student
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is big black guy
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know well over six feet tall a lot of muscles he's an athlete
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's Undisputed that
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,351	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	He and the accuser were in her dorm room together
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To hook up
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They took off all their clothes
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Chi
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Touched his genitals and
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Performed oral sex on him
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	She said
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	She did that because
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	She was fearful once they were both naked
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm and she felt that
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The situation was so overwhelming that she had to
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Reach Out And Touch him
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And then reach out and use her mouth on it
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And the school decided in that situation
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is that the only thing that had gone wrong
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Was that there wasn't a verbal confirmation
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,111	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And so
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	If if you go in somebody's dorm room you take and both of you take off your clothes
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And she
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Touches you in places your penis in her mouth when you're not speaking
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	She has not conveyed consent
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Which I think something is yeah
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah I guess from my from my point of view like the rules rsr setup
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Up and Away
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That the kind of protect
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The person who feels violated like it
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like I guess to me
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There's a man who feels violated
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sorry but we're not supposed to be concerned about who feels violated we're supposed to be concerned about who was
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Violated
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah but I mean I guess
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The person who was violation
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I mean if they feel violated then I would argue that they are they bad were violated
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What I'm saying is that like I think that having affirmative consent be
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	A rule that's that's that's followed and taken seriously when it comes to like
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Legal stuff it just protects that ambiguity you know it if it's favors
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For not getting the verbal yes
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,567	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What message about definitely complications
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What I think it's complicated but I think that it it it makes it so that the person who
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Was violated feels violated is the one
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:47,903	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Who's always protected and who's the one who's always in the right and I think that that's a good thing
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah I don't agree with you about that I don't know they're always in the rain
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I don't think they're always in the right
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They're always in the right but I think that it's
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Safer to assume that they're always in the right is going to be a very small margin of people who are not
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I feel like
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's important
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But how do I access my that's just my point of view how do we know how small that margin is
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I don't know how small it is
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I mean
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm thinking to
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Various
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Various encounters that my students have had for example where
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They both agree that they were having consensual intercourse
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And they both agree that the consent was withdrawn
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	During the Intercourse and the theater.
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The dispute is about how rapidly
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Stopped
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And so and and their
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Isn't
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know in that case I I just
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I just hesitate to say it in again in it it's it seems
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Clear on paper it at the absolutes of that what you control your body II you convey
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For example
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Start to cry during sex
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:07,007	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Alright well then okay I would assume non-verbally that
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	This should stop or you know we should make sure
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And it didn't stop but
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know did that take
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	2 seconds 5 Seconds 30 seconds
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And that
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	From from the the moment of
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:31,071	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know what should you reasonably
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Be aware of and I am very uncomfortable with the idea that
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Person has feelings
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Determine whether person B's Behavior was rape or not
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Because I always calling it rape I mean sometimes it would also if it's called sexual assault
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know sexual assault I feel like that's a really
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Important distinction
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But like the terms even sexual assault is not it is not adequate you know because there are so many different grade
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Gradations but I don't think I don't I don't think like I don't think
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I I personally I do I do think that if someone
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's someone's feelings should determine whether person be
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Have assault at them like I think even thinking about like when someone cries in the middle of sex
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know like talking about talking about like that is it is it 5 seconds is it 10 seconds is it 30 seconds
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like what are all the things that happened leading up to that moment
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What cuz he eats
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	He disputes he says
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I stopped as soon as I realized she was crying yeah
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And she says she says
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I I was I was crying for like 25 seconds less than 30 seconds
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And so that
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Period between when I started crying and when he realized I was crying
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I feel like temp to me when I hear a story like that
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I think that there was actually a lot of other there are probably a lot of other things leading up to that moment
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That we're not
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Received you know or that the reason why she's coming forward and saying that this was an assault this was a violation
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	There's probably a lot there's a
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	An unseen architecture 2-2.
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,959	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Did that story
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:20,383	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That is really complicated I guess like I could I don't think that someone would just come out and be like I cried for 30 seconds and then
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You didn't you didn't stop like it's probably a lot it goes it runs
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Much deeper than that there was something there's something unnameable happening in that room
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And she sort of hinges that unnamable feeling of a violation on
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	This is a field trial is Trivial when you talk about it out loud
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But she's trying to say something was not right here you know I agree
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So I very much agree to get into the complicated area of a kite
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Terry we agree on a whole lot that
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I don't dispute at all
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I see even and even in my cases where have the most doubt about what happened
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I don't dispute that the accuser feels violated I think I think that's
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	True
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They usually can be violated she is violated
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Because there's all kinds of reasons besides being sexually assaulted that a person might feel violated
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'll talk about
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	One instance
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For myself
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You don't work the people have broken my heart when I was in love with people
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know there was a breakup where I got treated like dirt
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When we were in love and like knew each other's family isn't all of that and then you know basically ghosted me and then
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Don't me
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Free phone call
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	10 months
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I felt extremely vile
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I can't put into words how bad he made me feel
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Ito en +
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It colored my memory of every interaction weed had for 10 months
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And Christmas together with my family Hawaii
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know and and
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Calling into question you did
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Was he lying to me then
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Feel very exhausted by his
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's probably not a word I would have come up with
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Feel
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Unbelievably. I'm happy married now it's all good
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know I should not have ended up with him
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But especially at the timing that that was an experience that permanently changed me I'm not the same person I was before that heartbreak
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sexually assault me
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know this is it was it was awful what he did
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I I just make sense to me that people could be unbelievably deeply hurt
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Buy all kinds of behavior that isn't sexual assault
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I can
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I can see that I can see I can see
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I can see that but I guess I feel like
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know what we're doing right now is working against history you know like I think that we're trying to
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Make progress on on this issue of sexual assault and the much larger issue of
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The imbalance of power as it is distributed between the genders
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Right can you ever really
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	As a woman and this is I don't know if I fully agree with what I'm about to say but it's just I'm just posing it as a as a Fil-A sauce
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Topical question
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know if you're if you're taught from birth to Define your pleasure based on someone else and someone else's pleasure
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How can you even know what you want or don't want
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In those private moments you know in like how do we restore that that balance
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sino yeah I think a lot of what you're describing is
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	On a
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What I'm seeing as a as a generational divide
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm in in feminism
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I don't know how old you are on 42 yeah I'm I'm I'm 30 yeah
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah women who are my age and older
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I find tend to agree with me
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:26,144	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And the women who are
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	College major in their twenties now often don't
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And the disconnect stems I feel like when you were describing
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How because of
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Societal pressures and training from birth and all that
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:45,600	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When the man was naked in my room I could not do anything but give him a blow.
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I could not say no
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,744	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I would say you did not say no
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And there may be
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Situations
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Where we agree that this is a Kent situation
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,520	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I don't see it as
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Positive
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	4

EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They put her in a pink dress. She has to give a b******
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I understand that and I think that's a really important point of view but I also I guess
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	People have done research about that the fact that like young girls Define how good sex was based on
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:33,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How much they perceive the other person enjoying it and then an even something as simple as that creates
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Up a power Dynamic and I feel like I'm not really seeing the men and the minute I know the
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The young man that I know I'm not seeing them understanding the power that they have that's really easy to
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	YouTube to abuse you know and like how do you fix that that's what it's kind of all comes down to and like there has to be
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What there has to be some kind of consequences if we're going to see a change

EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I want to bring some other voices
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Cuz Allen
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Where you're sitting and wouldn't I just place you for that way I can just like soap
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	As we were working on this series
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I mean it really was an exploration for us one of the things that happen along the way as we can be in groups of college students
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In different spots across the country
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Groups of college-age men and women on my colleagues back a wrestler and she Molle II or with women
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Going to hear more from the women next week
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Don't play with the bit of the man because
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When Hannah and Kaitlyn and I were talking it called to mind
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Something that I heard a lot in these conversations
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You have to take a leaf at some point
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:04,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You have to take like you're talking to this person you're making eye contact whatever
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And like it you can also can I kiss you
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And Mike
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They say yes but like at the same time
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sometimes you just go for it and like
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:17,728	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's where gets if he because of weather like
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Sacrificing that
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is what we need to do
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For no one to get raped
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know Nann
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Super malicious scenarios like maybe what we have to give up is just
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You're looking to rise the sun's Rising you're like
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Hello would you
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Can I record you on my cell phone if you saying you're down to make out right now
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:41,536	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know I mean
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know what something I guess I'm willing to give up if that's what's being asking if that actually solved the issue
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I just think that we're coming to a point where that might be the line by the way
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:27:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The thing you talk about that is actually an app that exists we talk to the guy who made it but what would he and other guys were
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Saying
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	We sit there on easy
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	They still feel somehow caught between those old gendered expectation that it's the man's job to pursue and
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The world at war now which seems to not
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Want that but maybe not entirely not not want that there. Sure and a lot of them
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:18,912	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Worry
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Then maybe they've already
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Cross the line
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Without knowing it
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Always in the back of my mind like I've hooked up with a girl that's like instigated it like
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like while having sex you decide that
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But she doesn't want to be like she was going to
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Gets up late
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know like then what then if if
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:39,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To the next day if she decides that
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But she realizes that like if she did want to do that
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Maybe after the fact
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Then it just be my
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I've definitely hooked up with people where they were very drunk the first time we hooked up
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	No one ever was like oh that was not okay or anything but
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In all the situations I guarantee they thought myself I was drunker than the person I was hooking up with
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:02,688	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Because I'm a man
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That could be retrospectively
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That could have been sexual assault
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's definitely the biggest question I've been asking myself post
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The thing is like wow
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Could it even be claimed like I don't think that I sexually assaulted someone
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	At all I mean given that
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know what I asked are you sure but
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:24,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That isn't even enough cuz that's a alcohol
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know even if you get a vocal consent
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	If there's alcohol involved
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:31,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So I guess that's work at then just interesting nothing make a cold but yeah
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Everything that you did make a mistake
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,272	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Benson was like that wasn't okay what you did to me last night or something
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Right
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:45,184	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You say your sorry I believe I really do understand that you don't like you learn like we now have to be I don't think my
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Be free like but I understand that but if somebody says like you sexually assaulted me and if it's
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Situation like you're talking about where you both have been drunk
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And you say I'm sorry is that not
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,728	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I would be scared to say
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That because
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How to say what I'm sorry I'm sorry because that's like you're admitting you're guilty even if you don't think you are if you try to engage in a
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Conversation like that so just maybe like you don't say I'm sorry say oh my God like please explain to me like how I did that were like what
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What happened cuz I was too drunk to read
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Remember or like something like that
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And after that you know after I
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Having
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Pleasure after listening to these guys and then having this conversation with Caitlin and Connor I mean four
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:27,168	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For 1
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:32,800	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Things that they were afraid of her exactly things that we were talking about into I started to think about the
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Fear
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That sort of ambient fear that was always in the room
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:40,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Can you argue there something useful about the
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Fear
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Because that fear
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:47,392	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Mike push these guys to address exactly what Kevin was just saying
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Am I push the guys too
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What what what I what I hear over and over again when I talk to it when I talk students is that
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The women in the end I get a sexual encounter are thinking about 12 things
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And the guys are thinking about one thing which is themselves right they're just they're not reading the room they're not reading their partner
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What's going to change that if not fear
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like the fear these guys feel right now could actually make them
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Start to pay attention
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Make us I should say start to pay attention
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yes it might
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I certainly think of my
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	SA
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Writing support
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,768	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	As a form of Education
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:28,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Coaching how a student should handle
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	A tough situation
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm not sure that
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:34,496	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Making the consequence
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,264	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It's really bad
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is what
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:41,664	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Makes it more likely that the behavior will change
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I would love to see
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,064	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Young men
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Encouraged
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To go through the kind of
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Analysis of their actions
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is that
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	My new with me and it and it's
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I think it's a really positive process for that man and
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:04,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I see what looks to me like greater insight
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Tonight it's going to bring it back to the moment itself
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Cuz a lot of what we're talking about
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	On a macro level
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:17,504	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Still have to be negotiated in these moments right
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:18,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And you've talked about
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The idea of we need a reasonableness standard for for the consensual moment
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Do you
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So to me it means that
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Communication needs to be in a shared language
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know if if someone says to me in Russian
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That doesn't feel good
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I just don't speak that
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So is it reasonable to expect me to understand
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,784	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What this person was conveying
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	In a language that I don't speak
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like I would consider trying to be a universal language now if it's dark
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You're not touching the person's face whatever you might not realize immediately
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That they are
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Crying without
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know it's not why Loctite crying
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I was just it's
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Tears and and and emotion and punch throat and all that
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:20,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	How rapidly is it reasonable to expect
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That you pursue
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:24,064	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Steve that communication which it is communication
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And if you could see the person's face
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:28,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That I dated Ariana ambiguous
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:29,952	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Communication
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It is it reasonable to think it might take you a minute
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To to realize that
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	My partner's feelings are totally changed
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	So there's a there's a spectrum between saying no no no stop and expecting somebody read your mind
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Right that there's a million different ways to convey that
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	With different levels of urgency and clarity
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I just think we should we should take into account
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What can we reasonably expect
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Him in this scenario to realize
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	About her changed frame of mind
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What do you think
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:14,752	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	For me I think a step forward is just being aware of the power dynamics that are happening in sex talking about them explicit
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:21,152	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Italy understanding what they are understanding the ways that they're fun the ways of their pleasurable
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I'm being really open
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	About those things and I think that like it all comes back to the communication I mean like I really like
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:36,512	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What you said Hannah about the about the languages you know figuring out how to speak each other's languages
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,536	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Figuring out truss
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And also just like
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Having there be less of a stigma around conversations explicit open
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Totally Shameless conversations about sexuality
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Would bring us
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Forward and in massive massive leaves around this stuff
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And also just sit like that they gave me I think the thing that I'm not seeing that I wish I did see was just
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:33:59,552	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Giving a s***
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know that Karen likes having
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Had like we know when somebody says hey that that experience sucked for me
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:12,864	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Having the other person be like Wow Let's talk about it are you okay you know it cuz I got to like so many situations would
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:18,240	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Would be would be would be solved if that was a dynamic as opposed to what are you talkin about
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Like
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The gaslighting all that stuff
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah that's my little Mexico
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:25,408	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The work I do with some of the students
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	When I say so what do you regret
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:34,624	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And sometimes you're not sure they're like a really didn't attack her
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:39,232	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I said but do you regret is it ever your goal
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To get into your bed with someone and have them walking away going up I'm glad that's over
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And the guys like no I don't want that and I was like well
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That's what you got
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And we can't dispute we can dispute whether it was an assault or not
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It is objectively the case
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But this person had a bad experience with you
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Everybody agrees on that
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,808	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And if that wasn't what you wanted to happen
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Then you probably have regret about that I should have done something differently so it didn't come out that way
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I'm not telling them what they ought to want sexually
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:15,328	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But I do tell them
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To consider what they want sexually
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It is it is not I want to preface this by saying I'm not saying that the training of men and women is symmetrical it's not
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But that some of them
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,640	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	May may realize
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,408	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Some of the men
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,176	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	May realize
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know what I was told that men are supposed to like any any kind of sexual contact we can get from anyone anywhere we're supposed to be happy
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Happy about that
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:41,184	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And is that actually what I want or is that what
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	People expect me to want and maybe I would prefer more of a
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:50,400	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know loving gentle kind of relationship
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Maybe I'm the man and not that kind of model would actually work better for me
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Then this Conquest model
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Interesting cuz it made what I hear a lot coming out of the me-too movement is that I hear a lot of women saying
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:06,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Guys you need to do the work
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:09,088	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Okay like this is this is largely your work to do
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Right now
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:12,672	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And I hadn't expected
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,720	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	To hear you
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Talking about
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:19,328	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	What you do as in substance being part of that like you are actually
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,352	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	It seems
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,424	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Involved in some of the guys doing the work
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I ain't like how to do the work
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:29,824	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Is its own sort of can of worms like which is something we haven't really talked too much about
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But it is interesting to hear that I wasn't expecting
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	That to
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Medication assistance that it's not necessarily Michael
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:44,160	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	But it may be necessary in order to achieve my goal which is to help you advocate for your education
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You can't do that effectively
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Unless you've been thoughtful about your past
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:52,608	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Might my thesis is gray help the kids
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Caesar Gray
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	You know this is this is not a binary world we live in in terms of gender in terms of communication
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	And and to some extent I feel like we have
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,016	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	2
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Work with
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:12,832	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	The complexity of what's in front of us
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:16,416	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Even if we wish it were black and white and that would make our job a lot
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Caitlin any final thoughts
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:24,096	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Amen no I don't think so
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I guess
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:27,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Yeah this is the
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	Great combo
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:59,936	| radiolab_podcast18intheno2 |	I want to thank Kaitlin Prest and
