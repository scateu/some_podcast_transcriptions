EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:03,552	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Zinc ointment
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Nothing new trash
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But then

EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And he's staring off into the distance almost like

EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I'm finding such a stash of candy that he had forgotten that he left
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He created a moment of just

EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Just before we go to the first story in this episode
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I want to mention that this
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Flower was produced by guy named Tim Howard
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	2

EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Reply all
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,103	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And ask him
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What occurs to use you as you listen to it again
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	There's this moment that jumps out at me where you here
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This woman Shirley McNaughton
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Who's like
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know key character in
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In the story
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She just radiates
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So much generosity and love
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,143	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I just find it so freaking moving
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She goes through a lot in the story like
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like she she really is just like
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Challenging
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Incredible in
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Kind of impossible ways
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did I think would turn a lot of people really bitter
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And I wonder how I would react in the end
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	With everything that she went through if I went through it myself
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And it's really
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It's really nice to actually think about that
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like how I would deal with such
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Such an incredibly child
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Situation
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Could I myself
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Keep such like
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Love
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And admiration

EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That was the beginning of his big idea
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That was going to change the world
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Fast forward a few years
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They came together

EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Everything changed
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In 1938
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Nazis came to town he was sent to Dachau and then boom

EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Feeling groovy xi'an desire to end my life
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	All around him people were being worked to death or outright exterminated but his wife Claire

EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Play My Good Vibes in my guitar into the concentration
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I became so famous among two notches

EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,031	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And you can say that it was
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Here in buchenwald that Karl started to develop his ideas about language
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:31,199	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	By the ways that you can manipulate word
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	For instance there was this one song that all the prisoners say
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The saddest lyrics in the world
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	At a certain point Carl started to play around with this song you know he'd swap out something sad lyrics for some jokes
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sing it for his fellow prisoners
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And forgot for a few minutes
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Study Island
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And there was terrible on the flip side
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Outside force him to stand there in the cold in front of these loud
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Speak and listen to
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Speechless speeches of Hitler and Goebbels screaming Nazi slogan
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like Germany above all
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:26,239	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Which makes you mad
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But after about a year his wife
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Somehow wrangled of a British visa for him and he gets out
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Thank heavens shows breakfast times
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And now I can play
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And improvisation as it comes into my mind
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In 1939
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He went to Britain
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	As a manager of a factory arrived in England just as
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The blitz Begins the Germans start to bomb every major city in England
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did you hear at the moment is the sound of an air raid siren every time you'd introduce himself to somebody new
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shutter
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:13,343	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That can't be your name because I like Blitzkrieg good attitude
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:18,207	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Trainwreck blitz so I change from the wall light switch
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To the peaceful
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That was how he became
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Charles
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Bliss bliss has all the right Association so he went forward with the feeling of
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That he was now Bliss and
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Would bring happiness to the world
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Or later he and his wife end up
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	China in Shanghai where there was a big population of
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Excel choose
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shanghai was the only place that would take them at the time
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Apply lifetime
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Now we come to his big idea
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I realized
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did the Chinese have
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He became enraptured by the Chinese writing that he saw the Chinese symbols
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In each symbol is a word
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Any rights about having this Epiphany when he saw the Chinese symbol
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Format he saw that the Chinese
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Written form of
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Man sort of looks like a man that looks like a stick figure man
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Adam means man
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:25,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He doesn't even know what the Chinese word for man is he doesn't know how to stay mad but that doesn't matter
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,559	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He is
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Skipping the word
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Then going directly into the meaning so here was a way of getting Beyond language
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You could think the word in any language if you see it in the symbol that was a revelation
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,591	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Why
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I'm you think back to the concentration camps when they were outside in front of those loudspeakers listening to Hitler
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Saying stuff like
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Deutschland Uber Alles
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,695	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know Germany above all
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,463	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That phrase
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Charles new
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did it actually predated the Nazi
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Earlier in 1848
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And originally it was meant as a rallying cry to bring together all the separate principalities
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That spoke German but these were not one country
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So when they said Deutschland Uber Alles
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,831	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Event unification
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Venetian above the state's us it was an Australian aggressive
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Hitler change the meaning
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Instead of the nation above all states
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He changed it to the nation
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	See see what happened this phrase that started meeting one thing unification
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,639	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Can the Alps
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yeah
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This is what the Nazis did
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It would been words to obscure the truth of what they were doing
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Extermination
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The college solution
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,463	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	By doing that
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,743	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	As he saw it
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They were able to convince
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Good
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Same people his neighbors
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To go along with the genis
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Then I realize that something must be done
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To make language more to it to Nature words were the problem words made people do cruel things
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To each other
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Fort dangerous instruments
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,343	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So when he saw the Chinese symbol for man
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He thought
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This might be the answer
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Chinese symbols but even clear
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Picture so simple if he could sit down and work it out
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,263	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You would look at the symbol
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And know what it meant instantly regardless of what language you spoke you wouldn't even need words which he felt could be eaten
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Manipulated you could just have the symbol and get straight to the the truth of the matter and the way he saw it right off
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	About you have all of these Bennett
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	English women historian
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Would you have the window everything from traffic accidents to health problems could be avoided he thought
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Thought his symbol system would just be adopted he had this Vision that high-level political and Commercial Legos
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Associations would be done in symbols did he say anything as Grand as like
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	War wouldn't happen constantly
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And even of course
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He reckon Hitler wouldn't happen basically that is the German people understood with symbols
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They wouldn't have caught
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Google's propaganda
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That's a pretty tall order but it did seem to be what he thought everything could be cured by the system he's a biggest Dreamer
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Ever
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	How did he go about doing this he started working out with the basic
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Lines and shapes would be he also wanted to make sure you could produce it with a typewriter so it had to be a limb
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Limited set
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Of shapes out of which everything could be created
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Okay so he works on it for 7 years 7 years and he comes up with
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That wow that is a big way this massive book called
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,391	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Listen bollocks
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Samantha ology
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Illogical writing for an illogical world
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:13,631	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Explain the logic of his system for example here he was a symbol for sword which
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Looks exactly like a sword
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sword plus it Forward arrow means attack
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I buy it
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then if you see a symbol for sword and another symbol for sword
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In the cross that means war
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Just the idea that you take these basic Elemental symbols and combine them exactly
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Here's another one
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This symbol here
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Is like the top half of a circle
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like a little Rainbow
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That means mine
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Mind it looks like the top of a skull
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Now if I were to take that
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Symbol for mind
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	An hour to go like
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This her to put
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Inside it
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	?
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That means
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I don't know or I know
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Doubt
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And they're all so you know ways indicate adjectives
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	First person second person
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pass
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The future but
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	How did the one thing that it did that no other
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Language arts symbol system or anything is attempted
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To do
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	At least as far as I know
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,255	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Is that it would
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Make clear when something was
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What he called human evaluation you know basically an opinion
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What you do is you put this little
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Does Little V symbol and you put it above this symbol
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And wife wifey well because you know how heavy is balance on a point and unstable at wobbles to him
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That represents
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Opinions human evaluations anything that comes out of mine
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Take metaphors
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	If you say something which is the top four
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,951	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	If he says
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You must put up
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Timothy wheeler the reader
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Do not
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Take this literally
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Without further ahead
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Not exactly bulletproof but
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I can I can see
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	See the thinking there I actually think it's pretty impressive
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Ben
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Okay so what happens next
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well after he finishes this and he and his wife are living in Australia.
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They spent all their savings on producing this book
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And sent it out
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Two professors
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Government officials heads of state like 6000 people
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They waited for the orders to start rolling in
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	No response
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	From anybody
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then they had nothing
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Can't say I didn't see that coming
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yeah and
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	With great

EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And a year later
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	His wife died
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know he had fought in World War 1 had been in a concentration camp had lived in Exile
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But he says this was the lowest point of his life
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Until one day 1971
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	As he said this letter floated onto his desk
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	With this picture of this beautiful dimpled child
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Proudly

EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Center
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A name that we
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We're very happy to leave behind us
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Matt Davidson
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Changed my name I started there in 1960
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	8 truly was part of this group of teachers and nurses
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Worked with these kids who suffered from cerebral palsy
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	If you have cervical palsy it's the motor control
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	From the brain that's been effect
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Which meant that they had trouble moving their arms or legs
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And even in some cases
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They couldn't speak
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,376	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They couldn't form word
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And in a film that was made of this class
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,312	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You see these young kids
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:08,896	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Children from 5 to 7
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I'll sitting in wheelchairs
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They're watching the teacher
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:16,576	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Talk to them and you hear them try to talk
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Her
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But they can
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	These kids had no way to communicate
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Can they learn how to read
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They could if you knew what they were understanding and they have no way to communicate that to you
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:34,240	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The only thing all these kids had we're pictures that they could point at they had a picture of a
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Toilet picture of food picture of a drink a picture of a bad
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They were limited to that kind of communication
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But I knew they were bright
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:49,088	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But it's a good move and they couldn't speak how how would you know
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Inside on that was the twinkle in their eyes
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But she says a lot of doctors and nurses at the time I thought I was crazy. There really wasn't much going on inside
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know they thought I was projecting into the children what she needed she said was a way to get through to them
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So one day she was at the library with a colleague and
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They come across this
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,408	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Dusty old volume that had never been checked out
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Called
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,944	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You guessed it
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The symbolic
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And what did you first think when you saw it oh boy I can I get back to the group how fast to the group with
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Is exactly what we need
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So do you remember what the first symbols were I think it was I
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	DUI looks kind of like a standing person upright line
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Small horizontal line at the base
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Next to it
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The number one which means first person use the same symbol but with a number 2 for a second
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then they had to have a verb
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And with love
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:51,808	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Heart with an arrow through it so now they've got a sentence I love you
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	One of our mothers that's the happiest moment she's ever had with her child was wondering child came home and said I love
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	View you know self
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shirley and her staff started to add more symbols but they caught on
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And pretty soon they'd created this giant laminated chart it had died
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:13,056	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And you and he she we
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And they then it had mother father grandma grandpa doctor nurse teachers therapist most men firemen
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Library dentist eventually they added adjectives happy sad and frustrated all the verbs
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You had loved and by
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And he wants needs understand
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pretty soon the kids
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Started to do amazing things with symbol combinations we started improvised
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Charlie remembers asking one kid
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Terry Martin what did you want to be for Halloween Harry pointed first that the symbol for creature
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Creature
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Not a person
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Then he pointed at symbol for
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Send
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,736	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Blood that night
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Creature who drinks blood
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,088	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	At night right he wanted to be a vampire
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,136	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He spells a new word
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It sounds like an explosion
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	With these kids
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It was
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It was
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	For the first time she says
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Actually
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Talk to them like
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Know who they were you got to know who the leaders were
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In the classroom those who wanted to help others
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Those who
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Copy. Others
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And it was around then that she and the other teachers decided to send Charles Bliss
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That letter
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We were sharing our excitement
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	For this gift is given to the children you know he was in Australia if he was an elderly man we had
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	No thought that he would come and visit us
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But Charles bless he was delighted
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Infinite baffle for cilantro recognition
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And now he had it
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Three mortgages house flies over
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Dances around and kisses everybody effusively
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:03,648	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Your long conversations with the kids in symbol
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He was very happy about
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The children
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,096	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Joy
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,168	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But somewhere along the way
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pinotage
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shirley Shirley in the teachers had begun to
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Augment
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They be going to add their own symbols
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Such as the opposite meaning
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Symbol
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This allowed the kids to take one of us a standard symbols
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Invert the meaning opposite of happy sad
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Opposite of Uptown
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Vivian out this would effectively double the number of adjectives
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Switch would be great for the kids and
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We developed rules for adding combined symbols for how to be more precise with the symbols
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pronouns that were missing the difference
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Between he and him and his
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,944	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In short I would make the adaptations I needed to me
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,272	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	From the very beginning we were using it
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To meet the children's needs
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Therapist
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:05,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Specifically
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And of course that is not what he had in his mind
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He wanted a system that was
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,488	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Universal
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Every change that she made
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,304	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Created like a
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Separate dialogue
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She would get very emotional about it. When he got back to Australia he started writing all these letters
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:22,496	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Basically taking issue
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	With her changes and
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Her failure to understand how his system work
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Thanks to Shirley worried about bliss's Temple's head Spread Way Beyond Canada
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Too hungry
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,320	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	France
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sweden
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Israel
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:43,744	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Zimbabwe
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Zimbabwe and then Argentina Brazil Finland Iceland Italy Bermuda Guam Japan Portugal Spain
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Netherland Hungary Switzerland Venezuela Madagascar Yugoslavia
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Fidelity places yeah
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And in each place
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The symbols would inevitably get tweets
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:06,016	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To suit that country for example in Israel cuz the writing goes from right to left you the blissymbols 1/4 Mile
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But what really pained him the most what really got him
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Was it these teachers were using his symbols as a step toward
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:19,584	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	English or French or German or Hebrew or whatever it was just a way to get the kids
EDL	00:28:19,584	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Two native language
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:25,728	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The teachers always saw it the way they saw it you start the kids on Bliss and then you introduce
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Reading and letters and eventually they're fully literate or with point
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You don't need the Blessed symbol
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This was the ultimate insult them
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They're using his system
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,272	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To bring these kid
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Back
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To the very thing
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That he was trying to get
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Everyone
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Away from
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,184	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Evil words
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	If I try to explain it today
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I don't want to listen to me then looks roomie
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,544	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That's right about this point in the story
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That you start to hear
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A different Charles
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shannon McNulty
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Hess
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,552	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Who sang perverted
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She smiles
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shibaguyz and she lies
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He kept sending Shirley and the other teachers letters and the letters got angrier and angrier
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:27,936	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This was not with the language was for this was a universal language that had nothing to do with spoken language you are
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Are ruining my system you are abusing it
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,568	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Eventually he decided to take matters into his own hands
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And he travels back to Canada
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And he started going to the various centers where the kids were using his symbols and saying horrible things about
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	About me
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I'm getting them very upset that's when I got upset I got upset when he got them upset not long after
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Shirley received a summons
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He sued them
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Misses jelly mcnorton on the tapes even suggest that he's going to have Shirley put away
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pro-life
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:04,800	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	4life
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:08,384	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Why was he so upset with her in particular
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well because by this time she started the international organization
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	BCI with symbol Communications International
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And you felt like
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This was
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The total unique and in powerful tool which could
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Could and should transform lives around the world and more teachers needed to adopt it definitely
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What was he asking for did he wanted us to use the symbols in his way
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So 1975 the bci-1 a license agreement to use the symbols in the workbook
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It's for the kids
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,408	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But Charles Bliss
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They should all be fine
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Didn't give up
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Authority parts
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:50,368	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He published endless tirades and sent them out to anybody who would listen
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Please show tonight
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In paper
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Or pacification
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:06,752	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The administration of the program or Shirley was working was desperate to make him go away he had basically just
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Destroyed the program and so
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In 1982 he and the BCI
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,408	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Finally come to an agreement
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It was
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	AIA financial
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:20,576	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Settlement that satisfied him what was the financial settlement
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	$160,000
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know we were a little program in the basement of the Ontario crippled Children's Center
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:32,864	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We were
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know just the classroom
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Wow that
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,544	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	To a guy who wanted to save the world ends up
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,848	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Robbing a bunch of
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Disabled kids
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I'm at Calabria crudely with us house
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Southfield
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They're basically that's
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Then
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did the symbols ever go anywhere
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:58,208	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well there was a lot of excitement about it in the beginning
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But it never spread very far it's used
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Now it a few schools in Canada and Sweden a couple other places
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But it never went very far because he was constantly
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:13,056	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Taking it down at every turn
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But here's what I find most surprised
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,200	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	When I when I talk to Shirley
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,992	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She didn't have
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Any bitterness
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,088	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Not even in the worst mom
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	When we were having the final
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,672	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Legal
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:31,232	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Action
EDL	00:32:31,232	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Go through that in the morning and escalators are packing up their papers
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Charles Place with Beach across the table and eats I surely will you help me
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,240	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So should go to lunch with him
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sit with him and then he asked me if I would come to his hotel that night and put the ear drops in his ears
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And I did that every night he would
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:54,016	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Involved with the sink that's just the way it was
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:57,088	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It wasn't just that she takes care of people for a living
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	She fell in

EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood brilliance
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:46,304	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:58,080	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,248	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,528	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Specific moments where

EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:02,976	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A turkey feather and he would sort of just wipe it clean with
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:03,488	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What is turkey feather
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,536	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Until I did find something you like
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then and then he would
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Tiny little wooden rod
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And he would just

EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:16,800	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Really really really gently lifted off
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then transfer it onto

EDL	00:41:21,920	00:41:22,688	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He could photograph
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Basically
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Photographs of a5000 snow crystals
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Just a farmer
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Doing this kind of is a hobby
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:39,584	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But he sold copies of these photos for $0.05 a pop to places like Harvard in the British museum in the u.s. weather

EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It's like you've gotten them on a Christmas card they're on your

EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,135	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Really clean and complex
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,207	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A lot of the greatest scientist who ever lived like
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:09,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Descartes and Kepler and hook they all tried to
EDL	00:42:09,791	00:42:11,327	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sketch and draw
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And capture the essence of snowflakes but none of them could do it as well as this one
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Obsessive loaner from Jericho Vermont whose photos were perceived to become more faithful to Nature than then
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Than anybody else's
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:26,431	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That was until
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This other guy
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:31,039	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	German guy
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Q the other guy dramatic theme music
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:36,671	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yes yes
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He was a German meteorologist named Gustav hellmann
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Gustav Hellman
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,607	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Not of the man
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:46,143	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Fame I don't believe
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:53,823	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I hadn't even thought of that I could see a contemporary of
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yes and he's working on his own book about weather
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:59,199	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Until he hires a
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Micro photographer
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:08,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Who is another German guy named Richard neuhaus and Mike
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:10,719	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Microscopic himself and you just take normal size
EDL	00:43:10,719	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Put it on and they take a bunch of photos using basically similar
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:18,399	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Technology
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Cameron
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Essentially
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,471	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But would they find
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:21,983	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Is
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:24,031	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Totally different
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:27,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Date did you not find it
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,919	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The elegants metric
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:32,991	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Ideal snow crystals that Bentley found
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did the crystal they found work
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Laud
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Lopsided
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Broken
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In the Martian who would only ever seen like glossy fashion magazines
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I just been given some like random family photo album
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Oh wow this is
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They're not so
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:56,031	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pretty ladies are kind of ugly
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:43:59,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Call
EDL	00:43:59,615	00:44:01,919	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did Germans day
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	They basically called him out. Bentley was a fraud
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	There was a particular way that Bentley prepared his photographs what you would do if you would use
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:12,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Pen knife
EDL	00:44:12,159	00:44:15,231	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Scrape the negative around the snow crystal which is
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:16,255	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What gave it.
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Can I make black background because he thought it would
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Can put it in me to soccer relief
EDL	00:44:20,863	00:44:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The German guy said that's
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It's it's misleading that it become mutilates the snowflakes
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Wait so he's
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,079	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Photographing these
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Snowflakes
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And then
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Significantly messing with the photograph
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Exactly right
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:35,967	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Exactly right
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Here's a quote from the
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,551	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Photographer who sad quotes
EDL	00:44:39,551	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	In many images Bentley did not limit himself to improving the outline
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He let his nice
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:47,487	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Play deep inside the heart of the crystal
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:49,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Fully arbitrary figures
EDL	00:44:49,791	00:44:50,303	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Emerged
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,143	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well I don't know that doesn't seem so
EDL	00:44:54,143	00:44:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Got no longer a candidate
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Well that's
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,519	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That's the question to them so they basically log this in
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:00,543	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Just kind of going in there
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Journals
EDL	00:45:02,079	00:45:08,223	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Bentley basically launches a counter-attack and what she says is that
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Doing that not correcting your photographs was anybody use this word like pervert
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Why wouldn't you remove specks of dust or other imperfections what white photograph of a broken snowflake when you
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:26,399	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You can photograph complete one so this is a quote from Bentley he said
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:27,679	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A true scientist
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,983	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Best wishes above all to have his photograph
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:32,031	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	As true to Nature as possible
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:35,359	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Any free touching will help in this respect
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Then it is
EDL	00:45:36,127	00:45:36,639	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Bully Justice
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:38,431	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So he thought his
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Retouch snowflakes
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:41,247	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	For truer than
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:42,783	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Normal ones
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,319	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yeah yeah exactly
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,343	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Did the scientist supposed to
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:46,879	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Various
EDL	00:45:46,879	00:45:47,391	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Experience
EDL	00:45:48,415	00:45:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Who is
EDL	00:45:49,695	00:45:52,511	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Seen every different variation on a snowflake
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	But Ken
EDL	00:45:54,559	00:45:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Bring it all together in one drawing One Scotch One photograph
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	The true snowflake
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,983	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	So if I brought him
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A slightly
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:04,799	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Gloppy
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:05,311	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Snowflake
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Look this is what fell on my nose
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	This is a true snowflake
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:10,943	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Because it actually
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:13,503	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	We fell from the sky and it's you know it was a nun
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Enhance
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yankee Woods
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Say that you're an amateur like
EDL	00:46:19,903	00:46:22,463	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Like this is this is not good work
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You know this is an aberration this is an abnormality why would you choose to kind of highlight an abnormality as opposed to
EDL	00:46:28,607	00:46:29,119	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	What kind of disturbance
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	True ideal snowflake
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:33,471	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It does that one exists
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:38,847	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	That's the key question for me like does the ideal snowflake exist in nature
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:39,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	You think there are such
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:40,895	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	I am scripture
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:45,759	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Sadly beautiful I would like to think there are no I think it if my
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:51,135	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Facts are right but the world snowflake expert is actually in in Pasadena Calif
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	All right
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Check check check check check
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:59,071	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Who can sunny Southern California
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:05,471	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Yeah t-shirt I have sunscreen lathered and I'm going to talk to
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:08,287	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	World Authority on
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Snow
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	How are you his name is Tenley bracket he's a professor of physics at Caltech
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Wilson Bentley
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:24,927	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Turn of a snowflake pictures under 10000 now
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:29,023	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	He actually
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:29,791	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Mix
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:36,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Artificially okay wow so this is a giant tank this is a nitrogen
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Nevermind that
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:42,079	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And get to your question about the ideal snowflake
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:43,615	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	A few things so number one
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Thereof
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,687	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Bajillion different kind
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Dendritic Crystal Stellar dendrites needles and columns and Hollow columns and
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:57,695	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	And the sectored plates
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:48:01,279	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	There never was so every single moment as it falls to the Earth
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:03,327	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	It's either growing or shrinking
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19bliss |	Get depending on the kind of trajectory through the different pockets of weather as it's moving down
