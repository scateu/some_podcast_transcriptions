EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:06,144	00:00:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:24,064	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'm Jedi bomb run I'm Robert krulwich you know what this is is from
EDL	00:00:24,064	00:00:26,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay so we can play you a little bit take first just
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To set up there what we're going to do today
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:30,464	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	About a month ago we were doing the thing about
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:31,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The fake news
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:35,584	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yeah we're worried worried about a lot of things a lot of people I but in the middle of doing that reporting we
EDL	00:00:35,584	00:00:36,864	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We were talking with
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I fell from Vanity Fair my name is Nick. And I'm a special correspondent for Vanity Fair in the course of our conversation
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And this has nothing to do what we talked about by the way Nick just got into a sort of a
EDL	00:00:48,640	00:00:51,200	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Well he wouldn't do a kind of a nervous reverie
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'd say he was like you know you guys want to talk about fake news
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:56,320	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's not actually with eating at me
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The thing that I've been pretty obsessed with lately
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is actually not fake news but it's Automation and artificial intelligence and driverless cars
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:04,768	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:06,048	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's going to
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A larger effect on society
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Then any technology that has ever been created
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	History of mankind
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I know it's kind of a bold statement but
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But you got to imagine that you know
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:21,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That there will be in the next
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,176	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	10 years
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,248	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	20 to 50 million jobs that were
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Call to Spanish. Automation you know
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:31,392	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Million truckers that will lose their jobs
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They do but it's not we think about like automation drive us cars and we think about
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,536	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The fact that
EDL	00:01:38,048	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They are going to
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The people that just drive the cars like the taxi drivers in the truck was going to lose their jobs what we don't realize is that there
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Entire industries that are built around
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Just cars
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sulfur example
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:53,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If you are not driving the car
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Why do you need insurance
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Did the new parking ticket
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because your driver's car knows where I can and cannot park and goes and finds a spot and moves and so on
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'm if there truckers that are no longer using rest stops
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Speakers drivers cars don't have to stop and pee or take a nap then
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	All of those little rest stops all across America who are affected people aren't stopping to use the restroom
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:17,728	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do not bind Burgers they're not staying in these hotels and so on and so forth then
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And then
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You look a driverless cars to next level
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The whole concept of what a car is
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What is going to change so for example right now
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A car has 5 seats in a wheel
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But if I'm not driving
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:35,136	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What's the point of having five seats in a wheel you could imagine that you take different cars and maybe when I was on my way here too
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,160	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To this interview
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I wanted to work out so I called a driverless GM car
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:45,888	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or Ivan meeting out in Santa Monica after this and it's an hour or so I call a movie car to watch a movie on the way out there or
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Apus car
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I pick up someone else we have a meeting on the way and all of these things are going to happen
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Not in a vacuum but simultaneously this you know pizza delivery drivers going to be replaced by robots that will actually cook your pizza on the
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The way to your house
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In a little box and then deliver it
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And so
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:05,344	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kind of a little bit of a along with an answer but I truly do think that
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's going to have a
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A massive Mass Effect
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Society
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:15,584	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Am I stressing you guys out and you are you having heart palpitations over there, so that's a fairly
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Compelling description of a of a
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Have a very dangerous future
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But you know what it's funny one of the things that we couldn't use that tape
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Initially at least but we kept thinking about it because it actually weirdly points us
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Back
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To a story we did
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	About a decade ago
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,088	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The story of a moral problem that's about to get
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Totally reimagined it maybe the what Nick is worried about
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And what we were worried about 10 years ago
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Anel coming dangerously close together
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So what we thought we could do is weird we're going to play you the story as we did it then
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sir the full segment
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And then we're going to a minute on the back end and by way of Justice claiming this was at a moment in our
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Development
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Where there's just way too many sound effects just gratuitous
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do much
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And also like we we talked about the fmri machine like it's just like amazing penguin
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Was
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Soda cam
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We're getting late for you and then talk about it on the back end this we start
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	With a description of something called
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The trolley problem
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,775	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Unison train track
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Go there in your mind
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There are five workers
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	On the tracks work
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It got their backs
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Turn to the trolley Witch is coming in the distance
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mina repairing the
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Unbeknownst
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They don't see it
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,231	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You can't shout to them okay and if you do nothing
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Here's what'll happen
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How did workers will die
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I was a horrible experience I don't want that to happen again but you have a choice
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You can do a
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Nothing or B
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It so happens next to you is a lever
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Pull the lever in the trolley will jump onto some sidetracks where there is only one person
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So if
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Charlie goes on the second check it will kill the one guy so there's your choice.
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kill one man by pulling a lever
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or do you kill five men
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	By doing
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Naturally
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Right here
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Part 2
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You stand near some train tracks
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Five guys are in the tracks
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	4 and there is the trolley, right
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Exactly how random a couple changes now you're standing on a foot
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,903	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The past is over the tracks
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You looking down
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Onto the tracks
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No lever anywhere to be seen except next to you
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There is a guy
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Leaving is a guy a large guy large individual standing next to you on the bridge looking down with you over the tracks
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You realize wait I can save those 5
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If I push this man
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Heels land on the track since
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'm not going to do that I'm not going to
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do the app that really you realize the math is the same
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Email safe for people this way
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,975	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yeah but this time I'm pushing the guy
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Insane
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But here's the thing if you ask people these questions and we did starting with the first
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:32,191	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is it okay to kill one man to save 5 using a lever
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,591	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	9 out of 10 people will say but if you ask them is it okay to kill one
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Amanda Seyfried
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	By pushing the guy
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	9 out of 10 people will say
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Universal
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:52,159	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And the thing is if you ask people why is it okay
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To murder
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's what it is murder a man with a lever and
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Not okay to do with your hands
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,095	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People don't really know
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Pulling a lever to save the five
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,959	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I know that feels better than
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Pushing a wine
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We save the five
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But I don't really know why so that's a good there's a good
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mohawk laundry Maria
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hahaha
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:20,575	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And yet having a moral sense is a unique and
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Special human quality than maybe we
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We pass to humans anyway you and me can sit at least inquire as to why this
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Happens
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I happen to meet somebody
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who has a hunch
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He's a young guy at Princeton University wild curly hair for the Mischief in his eye his name is Josh
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And he spent the last two years trying to figure out where this inconsistency comes from
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How do people make this judgment
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Forget whether or not these judgments are right or wrong just what's going on in the brain
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:57,439	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That makes people distinguish so naturally and intuitively between these two cases which
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Actuarial point of view
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	AR
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Very very very similar
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Josh is by the way a philosopher and in Euro size
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Scientist so this gives him special powers
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Cheers smoke a pipe
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,823	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Now why you have these differences
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Even though I would like to look
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Inside people's
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,175	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Heads
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because in our heads we may find Clues as to where these feelings of revulsion or acceptance come from
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In our brains
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I so we're here in the control room
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We basically
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Happens if the basement of Princeton
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There was this song
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Big circular thing
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	180000
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hound
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,007	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Brain scan
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Say a funny story
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You can't have any metal in
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because the magnet
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Tell me this long with the questions we ask
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People to make sure they can go in
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,527	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You have a pacemaker if you ever worked with metal Bowl
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yeah cuz you have little flecks of metal in your eye
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,695	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But you never even know where they are from having done metal working
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And one of the questions is whether or not you wear a wig or anything like that
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because they often has metal wires and with that and there's this very nice woman who does brain research here who's Italian
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	She's asking to her subjects
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,727	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Over the phone
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,007	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	All all these freaking question
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So I have this person over to dinner
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Unit study Brazil
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A few weirdest questions This Woman's like
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,175	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do you have a hairpiece
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What does it have to do if I have herpes or not anyway
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And she said yes yes you said you have a hair piece
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But she at
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Anyhow what Josh does it
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is he invite people into this room has them lie down in what is essentially a
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Cotton rollers
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	New rules been into the machine
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Their heads are brace
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Never done this
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yep several times
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I meant tells the story she tells him the same to a note Raleigh Tales you told before and then at the very instant
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They decided whether I
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Lever weather right now
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What's the man that insta
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The scanners
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Snaps pictures
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Of their brain
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And what he found in those pictures
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Artlink he showed us some
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The picture that I'm looking at
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's a brain look like it's from the top down
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is top-down instead of slice
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You know like
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In the first slide
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You showed me was a human brain being asked
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Would you pull the lever and the answering most kids with yes
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Little Pine
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Peanut shape spots
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yellow and this little guy right
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Here and these
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,279	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Two guys right
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Dreams being active in these
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Oddly enough whenever
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People say yes
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,191	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The labor question
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The very same pattern lit up
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Danny showed me another
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There's a side of Green saying no
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The large man
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And this pic
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Picture this one we're looking at
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hear this it was totally different constellations
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is the No No No crowd
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I think this is part of the No No No Cry
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So when people answer yes
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Clever question there are there places in the brain which glow
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Push the man then you get a completely different part of the brain by
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Even though the questions are
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Basically the same
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What does that mean
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What does Josh mean
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Ethereal
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Theory
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Proven but I think this is what I think you have it in
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He suggests
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That the human brain doesn't hum along with one big Unified
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Light system
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Define warring tribes
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	1edisource
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Doing a logical sort of accounting kind of thing
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You got one part of the brain that says
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	5 lies worse when life would it be better to say 5 vs 1 and that's the part that would blow when you answer yes
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I pulled the lever
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If this other part of the brain
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Would you really really doesn't like personally killing another human being gets very upset
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The Fatman Kate and shouts in effect understand it on that level it says
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No no bad don't do no hooks
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Instead of having sitter if one system that just sort of turns out the answer and Bing
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We have multiple systems they give different answers they duke it out and hopefully out of that competition
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Comes
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Morality
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is not a
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Trivial discovery that you struggle to find right and wrong
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Depending upon what part of your brain is shouting the loudest
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Play Bleachers Morales
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You buy this
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Don't know
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I've always
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hina suspected that a sense of right and wrong is mostly stuff
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Dipping your mom
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And your dad
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A dent from Experian
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Culturally
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For the most part
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Joshua
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kind of a radical in this room
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Biological
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Biological inherit from the Jeep Pass
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The sense of right and wrong it's already in our brains
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	From the gecko before Mommy
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:18,207	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are are primate answer
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Before we were
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Full-blown humans
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How to intensely social lives
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They have
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Social mechanism
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That prevent them from doing all the nasty things that they might otherwise be in
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Didn't do it
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And so deep in our brain we have what you might call Basic primate morality
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:38,431	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And basic primate morality doesn't understand things like tax
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:42,527	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But it doesn't understand things like pushing your body off of a cliff
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So you're thinking them at the man on the bridge that I'm on the bridge next to the large man
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I have hundreds of thousands of years of training in my brain that says
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Don't
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Murder the light
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,143	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We're at even if I'm thinking
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If I murdered a large man I'm going to save five lives and only killed women
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But there's something deeper damages don't
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Murdered Elijah
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But that case I think it's a pretty easy case
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Even though it's five versus one
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In that case
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	These people just go with
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What we might call the Inn
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Leadership
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,015	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But there are other

EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Unfortunately of describing an act of goodness
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Ten Commandments for energy
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:27,583	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But what's interesting is that we think of of basic human morality
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	As being handed down from on high
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And it's probably better to say that it was handed Up From Below
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That are most basic
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Core moral values
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are not the things that we humans
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Have invented
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The things that we've actually inherited from other people the stuff that we humans have invented
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are the things that seem more peripheral and variable
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Something as basic as
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Thou shalt not kill
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Which made people think was handed down in tablet form from a Mountaintop
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,071	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	From God directly to humans nochimson ball
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You're suggesting that hundreds of thousands of years of on-the-ground training have gotten our brains to think
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Don't kill your kitten
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:14,431	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You know that should be your default response I mean certainly chimpanzees are
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Extremely violent and they do
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kill each other
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But they don't do it as matter of
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,295	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Of course
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They so to speak after
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Have some contacts NC

EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Moral position
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Maybe somehow embedded
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In Braintree
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:42,335	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And Josh thinks there are times when these different moral positions that we have embedded inside of us Ann Arbor
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:42,847	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Braids
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	When they can come into conflict
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,735	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And in the original episode we went into One More Story
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,807	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This one you might call the crying baby dilemma
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The situation is somewhat similar to
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The last episode of mash
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Familiar with
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,999	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The way we talk.
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's wartime
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You're hiding in the basement with some of your fellow villagers
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,495	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Achilles life and the enemy soldiers are out
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They have orders to
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kill anyone that they fight
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Nobody make a sound
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So there you are you're huddled in the basement
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:24,063	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	All around you are enemy troops and you're holding your baby
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Your baby with a cold
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:37,119	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And you know that your baby could cost at any moment they hear your baby
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They're going to find you and the baby and everyone else they're going to kill everybody
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And the only way you can stop this from happening is cover the babies
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,615	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do that babies going to smother and die
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If you don't cover the baby's mouth
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Soldiers going to fight everybody and everybody's going to be
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Including you including
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Can you have the choice
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Would you smother your own baby
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To save the village
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or would you like your baby
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Knowing the consequences
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And this is a very tough Quest
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,631	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People take
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A long time to think about it
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:14,239	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And some people say yes and some people say no
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Children
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,055	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Blessing and a gift from God
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,079	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And we do not do that
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Next children
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I think I would
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Put my baby to save everyone else and myself
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No I would not kill the baby my baby I have the right
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To terminate
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The life I'd like to say that I would kill the baby but I don't know if I'd have the Inner Strength if it comes down to killing my own child
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Moon daughter my own son
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Then I choose that was done in World War 2
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,911	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	When the Germans were coming around
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It was a mother that had a baby that was crying and
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Better to be found she actually suffocated the baby but the other people live in
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No you do not kill your baby
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In the final mashup
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The Korean woman whose character list
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sluggishly
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	She killed it
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Oh my God
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Oh my God
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I just wanted to be quiet
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Baby
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Darrell Davis
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What Josh did
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is he asked
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People that question would you murder your own child
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	While they were
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In the brain scan
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And it just the moment when they were
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Trying to decide what they would do
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He took pictures of
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Their brains
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And what he saw
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The contest
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,527	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Describe before
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What's global
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It was a whole world
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:07,135	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	War
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That gang of accountants that part of the brain was busy calculating calculating the whole Village Podiatry
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But the older and deeper inside
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Also
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kill the baby inside the dream was literally divided
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:30,431	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Different tribes in the brain literally trying to shout each other out
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And this is a different kind of contest in the world
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We talked about before remember before when people were pushing a man off of a bridge
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Overwhelmingly their brains yellow
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No no don't push the man
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	When people were pulling the lever over
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Here
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I don't think really anybody win
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who breaks
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:54,239	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The time and they have to answer something right
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A good Quest
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And now
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is there a
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You what happened
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is it just two cries that fight each other out or is there a judge
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Well that's an interesting question
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And that's one of the things that were looking at
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	When you are in this moment
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,391	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Parts of your brain contest
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There are two green reach of these two areas here
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For the front
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Right behind your eyebrows left and right that light up
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And this is particular to us
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He showed me a slide at Snow's sword
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Areas that are very highly developed in humans
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So when we have a problem that we need to deliberate over
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The light
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Front of the brain is above my eyebrows
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sort of yeah
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Right about there
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And there's two of them one on the left and one on the right
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And they are the things that monkeys don't have as much of that we have
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Certainly these parts of the brain are more highly developed in
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'm looking at these two flashes of light at the
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The front of a human brain
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You could say we are looking at what makes us special
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's a fair statement
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A human being wrestling with a problem
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's what that is
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yeah we're supposed to emotional but there's also a set of a rational attempt to sort of sort through those emotion
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Those are the cases that are showing more activity in that area
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So in those cases when these
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Dots above our eyebrows
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What are they doing what he doesn't know for sure
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What he found
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is in these
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Close contest
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's whenever those nodes
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are very very Act
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It appears
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That the
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,448	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Calculating section of the brain
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Gets a bit of a boost
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And the visceral inner chimp
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Section of the brain
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is kind of muff
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,360	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,456	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The people who chose to
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kill their children
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who made what is essentially a logical decision over and over those
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Subject
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Had
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Writer glows in these two areas
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And longer
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Glows in these
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is Terraria so there is a definite Association
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Between these two dots above the eyebrow
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And the power of the logical brain over the inner chamber of the viscera
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Well you know that's the hypothesis was going to take a lot of more research disorder
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Tease apart
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What these different parts of the brain are doing or if some of these are just sort of activated
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Incidental
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kind of way at me really don't know
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Dissolve
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	All very new
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay so that was the story we put together many many many years ago about a decade ago
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And at that point the whole idea of thinking of morality is
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kind of purely a brain thing
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's relatively new
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And certainly the idea philosophers working with fmri machines
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Super new
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But now here we are 10 years later and some updates
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:48,064	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Call Josh Green in the long long stream of times I assume now you have a 3-g
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Giraffes
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:55,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To Bob's rats and children kids and we're close to adding a cat we talked to him again he has
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,536	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Has started a family he's switch labs
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,584	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	From Princeton to Harvard
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But that whole time that interim decade he has still been thinking
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:08,032	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And working on the trolley problem do you ever write the story differently absolutely
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For years he's been trying out different permutations of
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The scenario on people like okay
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Instead of pushing the guy off the bridge with your hands what if you did it but
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Not with your hair
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Still in one version we ask people about
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hitting a switch that opens a trap door on the Footbridge and drops
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In one version of that place which is right next to the purse
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Another version of switches
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Far away
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And in yet another version you're right next to the person and you don't push them off with your hands but you push them with a pole
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And to cut to the chase what Josh is found
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is it the basic results that we talked about that's roughly held up
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Still the case that people would like
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	To save the most number of lives
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But not if it means pushing somebody with their own hands or with a pole for that matter
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There's something kinda interesting
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He and others have found that there are two groups
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There are more willing to push the guy off the bridge
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They are Buddhist monks
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And psychopath
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I mean some people just
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Don't care very much about hurting other people they don't have that kind of an emotional wreck
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Response that would be the Psychopaths where's the Buddhist monks presumably
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A really good at shushing there
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Inner chimpanzee called it
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:22,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And just saying to themselves you know I'm aware that this is that
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That killing somebody is a terrible thing to do
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I feel that but I recognize that this
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is done for a noble reason
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And therefore
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's it's it's okay
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So there's all kinds of interesting things you can say about the trolley problem
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	As a thought experiment at the end of the day it's just that it's a thought experiment
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What got us interested in revisiting it
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is that it seems like the thought experiment is about to get real
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's coming up right after the break
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,840	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is Amanda Darby

EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And I request
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	About what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do you
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I noticed their writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If you have a story

EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Giselle Josh Green play
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You know now as we're entering the age of self-driving cars
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is this is like the trolley problem now finally come to life
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The future of the automobile is here
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Autonomous vehicles gets here first self-driving Volvo would be offered to
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,720	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Customers
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In 2021
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Where did the who this legislation is the first-of-its-kind focused on the car of the future that is more
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Supercomputer on Wheels OKC self-driving cars unless you been
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Living under a muffler they are coming
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's going to be a little bit of an adjustment for some of us
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But what Josh men
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What he said it's the trolley problem come to life
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:38,624	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He's basically this
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Imagine this scenario
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,976	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Self driving car now
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is a headed towards a bunch of pedestrians in the road the only way to save them
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:52,960	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Swerve out of the way but that will run the car into a concrete wall and it will kill the passenger in the car
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	. what should the car do should the car go straight and run over saying those five people or should it swervin and
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Until the one person
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,736	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Suddenly is a real-world question
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are people in the abstract
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Like what theoretically should a car in this situation do
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They're much more likely to say I think you should sacrifice one for the good of the many they should just try to do the most good
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Worldwide the most harm
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So it's between one driver and five pedestrians logic review the driver
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Be selfless
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I think I should kill the driver
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But when you ask people
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Forget the theory would you want to drive in a car
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:36,224	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That would
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Potentially sacrifice you to save the lives of more people in order to minimize the total amount of time to say no
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	No
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Absolutely not
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Would you lie in it
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:50,304	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I'm not going I'm not going to buy a car

EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,056	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So there's your problem
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People would
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sell a car
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And an idea of moral reasoning
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That they themselves wouldn't Buy
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And last fall

EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Into the middle of this contradiction
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay October 2016
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Paris motor show you had something like a million people coming in over the course of a few days all the major car makers

EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Everybody was debuting their new cars
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In the one of the big prisoners in this whole affair
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:53,024	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who's this guy in the future you'll have caused but you don't even have to have your hands on the steering wheel anymore
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But maybe watch a movie on the head up display or maybe you wanted to get emails
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's really what we're striving for
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Krista van Hugo a senior safety manager at Mercedes-Benz he was at the show
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They're demonstrating a prototype of a car that gets herself Drive its way through traffic

EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He's got a maximum of comfort
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Support systems being stuck in traffic jam
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Of course of course
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,184	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He's doing doesn't it doesn't even restore the show and it one of those energy
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We don't have on
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He was asked what would your

EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,888	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do any trolley problem type dilemma
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or maybe you have to choose

EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For many and he answered

EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You can say
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Eastside
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,920	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If you know you can save one person
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Save that one for
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is the one in the car
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is Michael Taylor corresponder for Car and Driver magazine he was the one that Christoph on Hugo said that to
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	If you know for sure that
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	One thing
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mondays can be prevented
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,280	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Impact your face primer
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So when he said this to you
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Streator Manor on check did it seem controversial at all in the moment
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I mean all he's really doing is saying what's on people's minds which is that
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Know who's going to buy a car
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:17,248	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The chooses somebody else over them
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Danielle he makes that comment Michael Prince it
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A kerfuffle
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Ensues Christoph Von
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:28,768	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Hugo from
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:35,168	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mercedes but then when you leave the questions you sound like a bit of a heel because you want to save yourself as opposed to The Pedestrian
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Doesn't it ring go of like just privilege
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's you or pedestrian
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And it's just you know I don't know anything about this pedestrians just you or pedestrian just a regular guy walking down the street
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Everyone who's not in a Mercedes
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There was this kind of
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Uproar about that
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How dare you drive be selfish you not make you selfish
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And then he walked it back and he said no no what I mean is that
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Just the weed
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	With that we have a better chance of protecting the people in the car so we're going to protect them because they're easier to protect
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,448	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But of course
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yeah there's always going to be trade-offs in that
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,080	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Does trade-offs could get really really
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Tricky
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:17,920	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Insult
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Because obviously these cars have sensors
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sensors light
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:25,088	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Cameras radar

EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	He says yeah
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:44,288	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Sensors at the moment on these cars
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Still evolving pretty basic
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We are very happy today we can actually detect
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A pedestrian
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Can detect a bicyclist and motorcyclist different Vegas have different shapes sizes and colors that he says it won't be long before
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:59,136	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	4 lochmoor about
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Woody's people are eventually they will be able to detect people of different sizes shapes and colors
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Like oh that's a skinny person that's a small person tall person black person white person
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That's a little boy that's a little girl
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,192	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Super get the basic moral math
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:15,264	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What is a car do if it has to decide how do I save this
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,544	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This boy or this girl
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What about two girls versus one boy in an adult
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But a cat versus a dog
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	75 year old guy in a suit versus that
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Person over there who might be homeless
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,528	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You can see where this is going
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:29,088	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It's conceivable the cars will know our medical records
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In back of the car show at that time cost
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Call communication cabling Technologies in highly automated driving
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:42,400	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	80s guy basically said in a couple years the cars will be net
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Work that we talking to each other
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Just imagine a scenario we're like cars are about to get into accidents in right at the decision point
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They're like conferring will who do you have in your car me I got a seven-year-old walstra guy makes 8 figures how about you
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How about full of kids kids have more years left you need to move will hold up I see that your kids come from poor neighborhood and have asked
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So I don't know so you can visit by yourself or not
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Therapeutic paradox
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We do not think that any programmer should be given this up measure

EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who supplies and who
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I think these are
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Very fundamental deeper
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Issues that Society at 2
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Decided large
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I don't think a programmer eating pizza and sipping Coke swimming
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How does society decide
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Maine help me imagine that
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,344	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I think it really has been able to feel your processor
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Rice told us to things bass we need to have
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:39,488	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	First we need to get these Robo cars on the road get more experience
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How they interact
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:43,072	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	With us human drivers and how we interact with them
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There to be like industry-wide
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Summit no one company is going to solve that
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,520	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	This is Bill Ford Jr
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Of the Ford Company giving a speech in October 2016
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:35:01,504	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Economic Club of DC and we have to have because he could you imagine if we had one algorithm and
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,320	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Toyota had another in General Motors had another and mean it would be
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Cuz like what if the Tibetan cars make one decision in the American cars make another we need to have a national discussion
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	On
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Ethics I think

EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	We've never had to think of these things but before birth
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,936	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The cars will have the time and the ability
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,544	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Who is this pasta
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So far Germany is the only country that we know of
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	His tackle this head-on
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:34,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	One of the most significant points the ethics commission made
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:41,184	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Autonomous and connected driving is an ethical imperative the government is released a code of ethics
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	It says
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:43,744	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Among other things self-driving cars
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are forbidden

EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	These are shouldn't be programmed into the cars imagine
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	How are few classes being added
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In the Geneva Convention if you were like what

EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,088	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is anyone's guess
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And what it will look like
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Weather it'll be like a
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:12,928	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Coherent set of
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Rules
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Or like rice
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:17,280	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	With the kind of contradictions we see in our own brain
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	That also remains to be seen
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,632	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	One thing is clear
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	There are cars coming with her questions
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I could never
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Where's it going
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,368	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	DMV
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:43,904	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Oh my God
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Okay we do need a caveat all this by saying that the moral dilemma were talking about in the case of
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:52,096	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Driverless cars is going to be super rare
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mostly will probably happen
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Is that
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,960	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Like the
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Plane loads full of
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	People that died every
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Day
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,592	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	From car accidents
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,896	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Well that's just going to hit the floor until you have to balance
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:06,688	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Few cases
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Where car might make a decision you don't like
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:11,552	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Against the massive number of life's a
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	I was thinking actually a different thing I was thinking
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:18,208	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Even though you dramatically bring down the
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:19,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	The number of bad things that happened on rug
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You dramatically bring down the collisions you dramatically bring down the mortality
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You dramatically lower the number of people who are drunk coming home from a party and just Ram someone sideways
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Isn't killing three of them and injuring two of them for the rest of their life
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Those kind of
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Do things go way down
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:39,968	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	They're the ones that remain are engineered
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:44,576	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Like they are calculated
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:46,624	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Almost with Forsyth
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,184	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	So here's the
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Mississippi nutrition website
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:54,560	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Oh damn that's so sad that happen
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,632	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But I got drunk and out of that maybe you should go to jail
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But you mean the de Societe engineered this in that is a big difference
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:08,128	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	What is operatic and seems like the forces of Destiny
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And the other seems mechanical and
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Thought through meditated something dark about a premeditated
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Expected death and I don't know what you do about that everybody's on the killers in the particular
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:29,632	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Kiehl's dark is a little bit like when you know should you kill your own baby to say the village like any particular instance of that one child
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:34,240	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	But against the backdrop of the life saved it's just a tiny pinprick of Darkness
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	You know how humans are if you argue back
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:45,248	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Yes a bunch of smartypants has concocted a mathematical formula which meant that some people had to die in here they are
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,296	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Are there many fewer than before
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	A human being just like Josh would tell you
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Would have a ruler of feeling out of anger and say how dare you engineer this in no no no no no
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:00,352	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	In that human being needs to meditate like the monks
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Silence that feeling because the feeling in that case
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:05,984	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Just getting away yes or no
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	And that may be impossible unless you a monk
EDL	00:39:09,056	00:39:09,824	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	For God's sake
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,664	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Civil right back where we started now
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:19,296	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	She said you have to think some people know this
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17trolleyproblemupdate |	Pizza Spruce Pine Manor on check with help from Bethel hobday
