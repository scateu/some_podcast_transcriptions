EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,719	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Free radio
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Where
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Like as a as a young radio
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Reporter you know how you were in your nose face
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	We also are starting some
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Idea of what we should sound like
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	What we should do what
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	What's permissible
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	And then you hear this thing come out of the radio

EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Piece of yours that had that effect on me
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	You did this in 1981
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,487	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	I heard it you know years later when it was featured on this website
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	But this is pre Radiolab so I heard that we had met yet
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	This is multiplayer
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	The story of the krasilovsky is one of the great commercial rivalries in New York history
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Began when Sam razumovsky open a moving company years and years and years ago
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Wayback
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	I can understand him
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Well my time and I've been
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:12,831	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Peterbrooke also runs the office at the krasilovsky trucking company in Brooklyn
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	I imagine there was a big family
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Brother's uncle's cousin
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Very competitive competitive is putting it mildly
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:27,423	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	The Firm started in 1904 when Sam krasilovsky and his brother Dave grazulis
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Formed a Hauling Company
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Call Sam krasilovsky and bro bro is for brother
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	And they would do move heavy things like church bells and statue
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	And help them they hired their nephew
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Microsoft
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	420 years everything was fine
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Mike until Uncle Dave decided to bring his son's into
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	The business under the circumstances Mike
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Had to disassociate himself from the uncles
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Fence. On his own
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	That is Mike's brother who will serve as our narrator
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	It is the late 1930s there are now two krasilovsky moving companies Mike's and his uncles
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	To remind customers that he was now in business for himself Mike took out a series of display ads in the New York
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Phone book on very page
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Weather krasilovsky Czar list
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Me Ed's
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,783	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Remember Mike there is only one cries a lot
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	In addition
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Remember Mike
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	On all the
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	The truck started in work
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Too many customers could not remember which krasilovsky with which they just open the phone book and call any Chrysler
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Husky and that is when Mike got this
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Incredible idea
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	He said
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:36,287	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	If you could move ahead of his uncles in the telephone book
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:40,639	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	People would see his name first and then they call him first instead of the other present
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	So he decided
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Do I add a new listing in the telephone but he took out the v in krasilovsky
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	I'm put in a u that made it crash lowsky
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	KRA Silo you moved him one entry ahead of his uncle seems by the alphabet
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	You'll always be
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	CVS
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,095	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	But Mike Kozlowski
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Is now called was not prepared for the perfidy
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Of his cousin Milton krasilovsky
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Milton Milton krasilovsky was another young son son of David krasilovsky in the early 90s
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	What is Milton
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Started a new trucking company called
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:20,063	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Crescent house key with a you as was the case with Mike but to move ahead of Mikey changed his
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	First name
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	From Milton to
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Mick Mick krasilovsky what are you hoping
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	That he would be ahead of Mike in the listings which of course she was
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Bianco's meanwhile anxious to catch up join forces with Milton or Mick
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	I'm created the
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Krasilovsky
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,079	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Safe Company they dropped
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:46,175	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Did the v in Kozlowski but in a no-sew the uncle's krasilovsky
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Moved ahead of Mike's Crab House

EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	But it's quite upset as well he might have been
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	For Revenge
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	He countered with a great leap taking over the atlas safety company which moved him to the front of the telephone book
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,815	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	Leaving the case behind to be finer air of the AC
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	But one year later
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast14happybirthdaybobby |	The uncles were on the same page
