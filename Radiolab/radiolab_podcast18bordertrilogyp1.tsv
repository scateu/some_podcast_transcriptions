EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:33,119	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Because if you can find pieces of a skull maybe you can ID the body and if you can ID the body
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Maybe you can tell the family
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Here's what happened to your loved one
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So we were out there basically digging around
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Four four other parts of this person
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We come across a human tooth some little tiny bits of rib bones
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But we never find the skull
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But I realize that
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Nobody's ever going to identify the person
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There's not enough left of them and
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Does not not likely to be a case that will be solved
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Now Jason says he knew of course that people are dying in the desert
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But to see this
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The fragments of a person
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Erased
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know it's very
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I mean it's kind of just it started to kill you
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:20,479	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Eventually he began have these nightmares snakes coming out of the eyes
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	About the missing skull bird swooping down and then picking up the eyes coyotes playing soccer with a person skull
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Couldn't shake the simple Quest
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know what
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What did this to this person
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And how many other bodies like this might be out here
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	How'd it get to be like this
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Questions
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	End up sending Json down
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Sort of rabbit hole digging in the library
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Forensics papers
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Missing persons report igartua gone missing historical trends
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:05,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Sociology paper is demography paper government document illustrations and the figures in the bitter Berry gunny's appendices
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And over the next several years Jason would end up putting together this
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Truly startling portrait of lost stories hidden statistics
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Little known policy decisions along our Southern border that completely upended how I think about this
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Issue issue
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Poses real problem
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Challenges that were constantly fighting about
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Don't never quite
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This part one of a three-part series
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	On our Southern border
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Will be doing it today and then next week and the week after
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Part 1
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Hole in the fence
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	All right so I stopped and started off
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	With Json question
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	How'd it get to be like this
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	How did it get to be
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That's so many
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	People cross into America through the desert like
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That's the classic image you have is someone who
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Walking through the
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The desert
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Why
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Out of all the places
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Along the border that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You could cross
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Why is it that
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So many people are are crossing in the hottest and most unforgiving place
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Imaginable
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One of the things that Jason ended up telling us about that we found
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Mosto
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Striking
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	With simply the numbers
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yearly numbers
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Of Migrant deaths
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What's in the desert
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And I mean it is shocking if you look at the date of their
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	A very Stark moment when things ship
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Is it turns out that
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	If you're looking at
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The number of people dying
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In the Sonoran Desert the numbers are a bit tough.
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Pain down butt in the early nineties
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's single digits five bodies one
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	On your six bodies another
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	7 bodies
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Overnight in the late 90s
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You go from 5 to 10 Bodies 2
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	200
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I mean it used to be that if you wanted to cross the us-mexico border
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You go down to
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Cassandis to Tijuana
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	At dusk
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Please call the soccer field
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You would hop the fence with about
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	100 other people in the witches
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Bum rush the border patrol in
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Pappy we get by
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Would make it into the US in
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You'll have to get caught sent back and people do it again the next day
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That was a system for a long time
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I'm in love tell me what change
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Well
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In the mid-90s there was a lot of push back up
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Against the visibility of
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Muffin topping
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It all kind of starts
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	With
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This little-known story
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There's a great book by
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This guy Timothy Dunn called
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Blockading the Border
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And it's about the Latino high school students in Texas
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Is right on the
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We ended up calling the author he mentioned Timothy done and it and I'm getting so interested in the story that done laid out for us that
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We're going to leave Jason behind for a while
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I'm going to go on a little
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yes
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That by the way is co reporter Tracy hunt
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	All right well so where we going to go
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We're going to El Paso
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	El Paso Texas
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yes at Racine I went to El Paso a while back
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Tomorrow of course he thought that if I was born somewhere else yeah
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Of course I mean I think about that
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I feel like
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I guess I got distracted you didn't finish the American flag
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And a Texan flag
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We went down to El Paso to visit
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	High School
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Call Bowie High School

EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Coventry students
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The detectorists know football
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And on their campus to have a huge football stadium with those big ghetto Friday Night Lights
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:22,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Marching band The Pride of the south side
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yeah your typical Texas High School
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yeah but there is something a little different about it and that is that almost all the students here
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Scared Jose or Mexican American
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Gisela
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Oscar and we actually talk to you one former teacher this is one cyber Coronado I was eight
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Teacher at Bowie High School in the 1980s and 1990s
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And what did you think
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I taught history and he said that in all his years teaching at Bowie out there for 21 years and never had a single analyst
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Really
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Single white
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Did we went to Bowie High School it's cuz something happened there in the early 90s
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Something that
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's sort of a note in a roundabout and and totally unforeseen able way completely change the way we
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Think about that the US Mexico border
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So we're going to start the stories actually in one of one Seibert tornados class
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:24,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The class was immediately after lunch
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And on this particular day that we're going to have a debate in class
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And one of them debaters
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	First one of the kids was
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Going to be part of the debate
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	With late yes
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Albert alphin came to came late to class
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so we've been waiting and waiting and waiting for him
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	10 minutes went by
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	15
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:47,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	20 and eventually he showed up being dragged in by the scabs
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Security guy
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The school security guard and I thought you the security guard and brought him in because he was you know
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Out doing some miscreant stuff like smoking pot again and
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so I kind of lay into Albert for being late again and for you know that pulling up his wrist
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Responsibilities with glass
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:12,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But but I was like no no no other says that he had been at the handball court playing with his friends
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And then when it was time to go from the quarterbacks
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Class
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	These two border patrol agents just came out of nowhere and their green uniforms demanding to see his papers like who are you
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Where you from let me see your ID and he Albert tries to give them his school ID but they wouldn't take it
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:31,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And they actually told him do you need today
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Federal ID of some sort
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	For them to believe it all that he was a United States citizen
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Or belong on the camp
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And one just standing there like haha border patrol really bringing the kid obviously
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Virginia three or four other students in class just kind of stepped in and said know what Albert telling you is true
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Not only is Albert telling the truth but in the last couple of weeks
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol had been on the handball courts and on the playing field
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Repeatedly stopping students harassing student and
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I was quite frankly shocked
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One says of course he knew that the Border Patrol was around
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Because of where the school is situated which will
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Talk about in a second
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But he just never understand
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Present they weren't his students live
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I was having a hard time processing
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So the next few weeks
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One started asking around different students being like
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Hey have you had anything happen with border patrol at school and I got literally hundreds
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The stories I was walking home from school and then I have my backpack on
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This is Nidia Rodriguez who was a freshman at the time and all the sudden I saw this truck
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol tracking
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Eating my way a couple of Agents got out of the truck and started questioning her where am I where am I going
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We're all rounded up remember is walking to
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	School with a bunch of kids
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Her backpack and again you know a couple of Agents got outside questions or we were born
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Birth classes were taking.
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	School what do you have in the bag
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	When I go books
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know what else would I have in my bag
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Play like walking through yelled at me over here
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:25,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Sped up to me in the stopped in front of him to ask me
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know what's what's in the bag of the books
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One of them rip the bag out for my hands
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	As I was trying to pull it
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Away from home the other one grabbed me and pushed me up against the truck
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Forcibly
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The bag way
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Rifle through it
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Push me out for the
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I already pulled me away from the truck
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I threw my bag at me and told me to get out of here
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	As the stories came out it became clear that even the staff had had its run-ins with the border patrol we talked to the
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Assistant football coach

EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Two of his football players they got pulled over by the border patrol
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And one of them actually pointed a gun at his

EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One of the scariest
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Things
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In my life
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Why was the Border Patrol
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	On the grounds of the
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They have some reason what's a little bit more maybe because I seem to understand
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What was going on at
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Bowie High School
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You have to understand something else
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The legend of El Paso
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You have to understand
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	El Paso
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Flavor
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	From 30000 feet
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Right on the border of Texas
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Mexico and New
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's also the biggest city
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Shares a border with Mexico to the other thing to know about it is that it's like it kind of has a mirror City on the other side of them
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Which is
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Water
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Ciudad Juarez
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The largest city on the US Mexico border
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The two cities are separated by the
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Little sliver of the Rio Grande but they were essentially the same city up until 1848 when the US
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Invaded Mexico in Annex half the country
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And even now according to Juan this mythical division between these two cities it's just
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Doesn't exist remote
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I mean I go to the dentist over there I buy cigarettes over there okay I smoke it
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Almost everybody El Paso knows people live in ciudad Juarez
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	People feel a lot of snow people in have family members who live in El Paso
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And this is literally one community
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But the thing is when everything was going down in Bowie in the early 90s it was a community
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In crisis
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The night shoot
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The peso crisis has spilled across
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The Rio Grande
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In the eighties the Mexican peso
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Trash
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Until people in Juarez started flocking you a passo because
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Well that's
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Swear the jobs work like Johnson Construction childcare gardening
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Kermit.the coming to El Paso legally that then you had all these other people workers required by
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Lock and get permits but they still need it to work simply respond to the laws of supply and demand
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so they started coming to across the border to the United States
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	At unprecedented numbers ten thousand people a day
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	A day
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You legally basically for their commute to work
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was chaos
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was a mess here
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol Agent Venom David Hamm as a special agent
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	He told us that when when he was on that job
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Before Dawn you can go down a certain parts the Rio Grande you have a hundred two hundred people lined up
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Waiting on the River's Edge sun come up in here they come
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Rush hour has begun the rush across the Rio Grande into El Paso
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And there videos where you can see that you you see people waiting into the shallow parts of the River to cross over to El Paso
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	If they don't want to get wet they can pay a young entrepreneurial small fee and raft across
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Is border patrol agent
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It becomes this cat-and-mouse game probably the way we've always done business
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They come in you chase him
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Catch him and send him back
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:03,776	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Day and night and day and night it was it was
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Never ending job
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And it was something you know you catch the same guys to three times a shift sometimes
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Hello I'm sorry
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was it was chaos
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Obviously we're not accomplishing 100% of our nation
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Eggs that you got a hilarious

EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Did not keep a lid on this situation
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	An in the shop
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Behind him salute free

EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Climbing up the banks of the Rio Grande and just walking into El Paso
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Laughs like having Wyatt Earp standing in front of three bank robbers robbing a bank
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Like so
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	How many
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Alright so it was reported
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	At a time that for everyone migrant the border patrol caught
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There were at least three to five
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Who snuck in and didn't get caught
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And The Weather Channel said that this was because they just didn't have the right
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Didn't have the money or the agents
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To apprehend all these people that are coming in
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Which finally brings us back
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To Bowie High School
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Okay alright okay yeah let's try it
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Because there's two important things about
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Counting my steps
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	1
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Who is
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Right right or
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	5 6
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Right on the ball
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	49er basically it's 50-50 steps 50 steps from the
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We can't fit into Mexico into
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The former
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Assistant football coach and teacher benemerito he showed me
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:24:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What's the what is that
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Dispense
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The old manse
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:08,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Put up a bunch of fencing on the border to curb
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Illegal immigration
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So it's like a
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Did so much taller than us but it was it was pretty flimsy they called it to Tortilla curtain and
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Right at this spot across from Bowie High School
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There was a hole
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	In the fence
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And David
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Former border patrol agent told us what that meant was that you had mine heard you had a lot of migrants
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Could be
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Coming through that hole in the fence for Bowie High School
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And he claimed that it wasn't just people looking for work
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was also people bringing in drugs
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	No way I know that because I work
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Anti-smuggling unit
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Watch him come through
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so border patrol agents had taken
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:56,320	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To just sort of hanging out around the school on the school's property on the football field across the
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Street from the school like just they were just there all the time even rumors that border patrol
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You just would go undercover as students
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And that they would you no wonder the Halls that they would go into the locker rooms I've noticed the
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The Suburban
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,472	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Parked on the bully camp
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Again former Bowie teacher
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	1 Seibert Coronado the whole reason you know that I thought they were there was the chain link is cut and they need
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Stop people
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	From entering into a high school
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:28,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Instead of realizing that what they're doing is they're using the high school as a hunting round
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:35,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so the one when he started hearing about all the stories of these 14 15 16 year old kids
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Stockton shaken down
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It wasn't about border patrol trying to stop migrants from coming in or trying to stop drugs from coming across the border
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was the border patrol simply stopping people because they were Brown
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And that's really
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	His Radio
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Angered me
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But for most of these kids
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Look out of the ordinary
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know kids like Ernesto Munoz

EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Or maybe the kids in math class

EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And Tony
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Okay alright so some of these kids at Bowie High School they actually belong to this group
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Which is a Chicano civil rights
EDL	00:30:51,904	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This has been around for holidays
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Cintas 1960s it was a college group that these kids at Bowie actually petition them to have a chapter at
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And I said sure
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:08,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We were the first ones to get the Collegiate group
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Supervised we would meet about once a week
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Our meetings tended to be 30 40 50 kids
EDL	00:31:15,456	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Packed into a classroom
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:21,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And for one of these meetings one brought in one of his friends a woman named Susan Curran
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	She works for the Border rights
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Coalition and social
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	She comes in and he student start telling her you know what's been going on
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And they asked her if we have any rights here
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	She tells them absolutely you do because according to
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The US Constitution
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The border patrol or really
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Any officer of the law they cannot
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Stop you
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Without reasonable cause
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Beyhadh 15 you cross the border or when you saw them he started acting fidgety or you ran away or some
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They can't just arbitrarily stop you question you because of the color of your
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That's not enough to stop you
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Because if that's the only reason they have to stop you then they're violating your fourth
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Right the right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They just said you know what
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You're getting your rights are getting stomped all over let's see
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What we can do about this because it needs to stay
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	After Susan explain that the rights were being violated the conversation turned to what are we going to do about it
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:23,808	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We have a lot of students who were suggesting things
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:27,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That were probably you know slightly inappropriate
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Like how about we just curse him out which I thought will make us out a bad approach
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But apparently
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	According to one's friend Susan
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Better to salt and so away from them
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Definitely don't do that
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,896	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Finally
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One of the students
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Who's been watching Law & Order attempted murder of your mother
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:32:59,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Who's knew all about
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Saying the right to remain silent
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You would like nothing it's your 5th amendment constitutional right
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Isn't that you typically hear or instructed by my counsel
EDL	00:33:13,984	00:33:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Not to test
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The five based on my fifth amendment constitutional rights
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	When rich white dudes get into
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Advice of counsel I broke my 5th Amendment privilege
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And respectfully
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,248	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Decline to answer your question
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But this one Bui match a student would like
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Why don't we do that
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And that's exactly what our students started doing
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	After that when border patrol agents would stop students and say hey give me your papers
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Some of these students would say
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	No I want to use my Fifth Amendment right I want to take the Fifth Amendment
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Simple as that they have the right not to incriminate myself
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Tremaine Style
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:55,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I do not want to answer your question
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:34:02,112	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Start Heidelberg right to remain silent
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:08,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I don't want you to go through any of my stuff backpack
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Amendment Amendment right
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:14,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Spreading around right to remain silent
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	That we really
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:18,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Dump near me
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:19,520	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The answer people's questions
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The reminder
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Why why why
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Myself being

EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:39,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Students and on the one hand obviously this is their legal right not to
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Provide
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Information on the other hand
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:45,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I can imagine that you know I've heard that there are
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol abuse has there are

EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Be home
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Stonewall

EDL	00:34:58,944	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It could put them In Harm's Way
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And it did free
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Students were harassed for this
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Students were
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The most notorious case is the case of David Renteria
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:22,752	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And the way I started was on June 3rd

EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:08,384	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Kept Good Morning America out because one of the students take this
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:10,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And then we need to get our hands on it
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So it's like 30-40 kids from matcha in this classroom
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And Dale misegades
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	He was sitting in front of us
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Wearing a suit and tie trying to put things into perspective
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Started telling the students like
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Look the holes in the fence
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I can't hold it hold
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	We keep patching them up they keep getting cut open
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I can't I
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I don't think there's any way in the world
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:41,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And he told the students say they busted some people who had brought drugs through Bowie
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,944	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Investigation
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:48,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So music is this like we're essentially trying to stop the flow of drugs here why are you guys complaining so
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:55,232	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But eventually
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Decedent start speaking up
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:10,336	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	One student stands up and says hey you're harassing us and that's why we're upset
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And be your strategy for capturing border-crossers seems to be to heard them all into the school where they're penned in
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Relevant to a place where they can get out of the you circled in it
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's raining like cat people
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Will not stop
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I don't like
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,728	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You know I don't know a better way to do it but not at the sacrifice of a right
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:41,056	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's a little hard to hear but he said not at the sacrifice of our rights
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	I do not have right
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:57,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What did it feel like to be sitting in that meeting I mean
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It felt bizarre I mean that you know somebody is denying what everybody sees with her own eyes
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There was no face value to what what he said now cuz it that when we were standing cynical about the whole situation and
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And are you trying to undo the stuff that was already
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To the meeting goes poorly
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:20,224	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And a bunch of the students and some of the staff including benemerito this is
EDL	00:40:20,224	00:40:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Football coach who had a gun
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They all together decide that they want to
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Sue the Border Patrol
EDL	00:40:29,440	00:40:30,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The phone rings one day
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And eventually they call up this guy
EDL	00:40:32,768	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	If we're getting ready to sue the Border Patrol
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:36,352	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Will you be our local Council
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:38,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And I said no but hell yeah
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	El Paso civil rights lawyer
EDL	00:40:41,728	00:40:45,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Albert armendariz jr. optimistic
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's never nice job during the government is not easy when you live on the border and working Segundo Barrio
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You are never optimistic
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:57,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Then a governmental system is going to work for you
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:58,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	October 23rd 1992 the trial between Bowie High School and the border patrol begin
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And apparently the courtroom was
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Pretty much divided in half on one half you had the border patrol like
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Agents in full uniform sitting there
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Another half you had these boots
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Dressed in their finest
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Mini dresses black
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:23,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Those kids were little Troopers
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They all done up in the stand
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Told her story
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And then eventually
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol sector Chief still missing
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Do you remember what the defense's argument was
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:37,792	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Well they had lots of argue
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,608	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Now we can't verify this
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:44,192	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Specifics of what happened in the courtroom because a lot of the court documents of being destroyed
EDL	00:41:44,192	00:41:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Music it's got off there and his basic argument was it
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	If you look at
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	The US code
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Federal regulations
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	1357
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Powers of immigration officers and employees
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Number one
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Officers
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Have the power to interrogate
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:03,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Any alien or person believed to be an alien
EDL	00:42:03,647	00:42:06,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	As to his right to be or to remain in the United States
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And I can do that without a warrant
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And then
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:17,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They can do that quote within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What's a what's a reasonable distance
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So this is what nuts has I I don't know exactly what
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Went into the germination of what that is but the distance is
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	A hundred miles
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Really yeah in that hundred mile Zone border patrol has the power to interrogate has the power to arrest without warrant
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And they can also and I'm quoting here
EDL	00:42:35,903	00:42:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Quote search for aliens in any Railway car aircraft conveyance or vehicle within that
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And then on top of that within a narrow word
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Distance of 25 miles
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Miles from the border
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They can go right under private property
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Whenever they want
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:53,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	There's the zone
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's designed
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To prevent
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:57,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Border patrol officers for being charged with
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	With trespass
EDL	00:42:59,199	00:43:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	When patrolling the Border
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:02,271	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Akai cross-examined
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Music
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And so
EDL	00:43:04,831	00:43:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What music it was arguing is it like if they have all this power
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And if they can go on private property right up on the border
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	And you got this High School On the Border
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:20,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Then there's no question that they can be on school property and do their jobs that's how they read that
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:23,263	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	But they couldn't understand is
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They were
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Doing it in a way that violated the Constitution and that is against the supreme law of the land
EDL	00:43:30,175	00:43:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	This was Albert's argument that
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	No matter what towers you have you can't violate somebody's Fourth Amendment right
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You have to have a
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Gintama treason
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To stop somebody
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	So what did the court ultimately happened before this court is finding us that says findings of fat
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Facts and conclusions of law

EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	What we got in front of me here
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Jurisdiction and venue

EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It's about the time with both of them
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:31,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	From stopping and questioning an individual as to
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	His or her right
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	To be or remain in the United States

EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	It was just
EDL	00:44:56,447	00:44:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Like she was a big celebratory school assembly
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	They're all

EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:19,487	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Holds that the border patrol did violate constitutional rights
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	You just don't see the agents on our campus anymore
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:27,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Deputy assistant football coach been Maria who ended up being a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:33,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp1 |	Treating us like people like second-class citizens
