EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And just as they step out of the mind they hear this whistling sound over their heads and then a moment later there's
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A tremendous explosion
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And they see this
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Rising cloud of dust about a mile away across the valley they turn into
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:03,392	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Look it's Dusk and so in the fading Twilight they can't be sure exactly what they're looking at

EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Until eventually they lose sight of it in the Darkness

EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Here's what he sees in that field
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	He was
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I mean if you look at a picture of this thing it's this huge globe
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	30 ft in diameter
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Paperwhite
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And I'm coming down
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	From this globe are these thick
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,615	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	40 ft ropes
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	At the bottom
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Attached to it is a
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Is a heavy metal Chandelier
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	With bombs
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Hanging off the bottom
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And Sheriff hide
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	She sees this thing runs onto the field
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Grabs onto the Rope
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To maybe tight down
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But just as he grabs it
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Augusta wind comes by lift him up off the ground like he was paper
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And so he's dangling from the ropes of this thing the balloon is above him the explosives her are below him
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And it takes him across this Canyon
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And he's holding on just dangling from it still trying to Wrangle it like like some bucking bronco VLAN
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,831	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And again he tries to tie it to a
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Juniper Bush or something but the wind catches it again and goes back over the canyon back to the first side back to the
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The first signed I started float around the field he kept wrestling this balloon for a long time he's nauseous
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	From being spun around on this balloon his vision getting blurry his hands are becoming raw from the Rope but he
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	He feels dislike sense of Duty the government wanted one of these balloons his territory so he's got to take it
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Down that's right he finally
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Lets himself free fall so he can grab it again so his weight will jerk the balloon to the ground
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Then finally the bloom came down in and kind of a little Ravine where Sagebrush were girl
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Going in a rooted been exposed on the side of the Ravine from a Sagebrush and he hooked his arm around the
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	This route then he was able to hold a balloon without being carried into the air
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So you actually captured him a personal letter of thanks the end up shipping all of the f
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Evidence off to the Aberdeen
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Military
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Research facility where they have gathered
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	All this different evidence from all over the country
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	After looking at this stuff
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	For a while
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They were able to tell that
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Apparently this bomb
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Was not of any particular American make
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And match known characteristics of Japanese bombs
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Cyst Japanese
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But it's impossible
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To send a balloon across the Pacific Ocean at the
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Disappointments never
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Never been done I mean that it's
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Basically an intercontinental ballistic missile
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,271	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So they're trying to figure out where it's coming from
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They thought maybe they were being launched from submarines
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Maybe they were coming from beaches in North America from saboteurs there was even speculation at one point and maybe
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They were coming from Japanese internment camps
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In North America
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Then two days before Christmas 1944 in Alaska
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A Native Alaskan trapper
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,543	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Trax wind down
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And it has
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	2
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Sandbag
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Still attached
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To the bottom of string
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And that
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Turns out to be the key to the mystery
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Sand yeah well that just saying there's a lot in there
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	My name is Eliza bergslien and I am a forensic geologist we call the police to help us understand this next part what
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Was the sand for the balloons was sent to Washington DC
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Just some scientist
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	At the US Geological Survey right away they discover that there's no Coral so you don't have finding no
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	No Coral cold water now they look at the diatoms Marine 5 oz
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Stop at fossil mollusk by compiling all of these different characteristics put that all together
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The other where would you find these diatoms these minerals that you wouldn't find Coral though all those different pieces of information
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Altogether the geologists are able to determine that there are
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	2 or perhaps
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Three beaches
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In the world that fit all of these qualifications
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,263	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Where they believe the sand could have come from
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And all of which are on the east coast of Honshu the largest of
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Japan's four main islands
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	You can get that
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Kind of specific from Sandy yep
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That kind of

EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	6 thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Why would the Japanese choose to
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To deliver
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,839	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Buy balloon
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It's a strange choice
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	After Pearl Harbor in as like they whenever you know they could be playing
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Well
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Iowa temperature history in the making it grew directly out of the Doolittle Raid
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Back in April of 1942
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	When is Raiders took off from an aircraft carrier
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Deep in the Western Pacific and drop bombs on
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Tokyo and Yokohama and Kobe and a number of other cities across Japan
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In the history of aerial Warfare they didn't do a lot of damage
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Physically but it was such a shock to the Japanese
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To think that their Homeland could be invaded that these planes could actually fly over the Imperial Palace.
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The home of the emperor and if you little bit holder the palace I just realized that he went all the way down town in Tokyo
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Oh yeah right over the city
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And so immediately after the Doolittle Raid and Order went out
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It was just find a way to bomb America
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Japan's Navy
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	TV is stretched so thin at this point in the war
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:54,175	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	There's no way they can pull off something like the Doolittle Raid they didn't have aircraft carriers that could get their plane
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Close enough to the US Mainland but what they did have
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What's the wind
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Today we call this the Jetstream that name didn't come along until after the war at that point we barely knew about the jet stream
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Prior to and during the war the Japanese did an extensive research into these winds Okay so
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In 1924 there's this meteorologist name blah Saburo issue
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And he goes to the top of a mountain
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And he releases a bunch of these
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Little paper weather balloon
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And he discovers that
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	At about 30000 feet up there's this River of fast-moving air speeds up 275
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	5 miles an hour
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Drink anything and it's Miss pollen insects
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	All the way to North America within days
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And after the Doolittle Raid they thought maybe if we were to release a bunch of balloons
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And just the right place at just the right time
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Maybe this jet stream of Erica
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Push these balloons across the Pacific Ocean

EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In 1944 she said she was a teenager
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,951	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	When the Japanese military came to the school and basically
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Turn it into a factory
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	She and hundreds of other school children
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Were conscripted to begin making this
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Special kind of paper out of mulberry wood

EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Gluing them together
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Why didn't they have adults in the car
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They were all Fighting the War 1

EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I think I read that long
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Okay my
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And after they finished
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Producing the balloons
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And after the blooms were strapped with bombs
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They were shipped off
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To those beaches
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Just
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Letgo
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	People from the Japanese side watching them take off
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Said they look like
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Huge jellyfish swimming through a pale blue sky
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	These perfectly silent Vehicles the only sound was
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The rustling of the paper is they took off
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	How many were launched
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	From November 1944 to April 1945 they launched 9000 balloons
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Now
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The engineers in Japan who designed this
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Faced a very serious problem once we got the balloons up into the jet stream and they were cruising along their floating it to be
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	He's from fifty to a hundred miles an hour
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But every night temperatures are going to fall to -40 centigrade
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And the fixed volume of hydrogen inside that envelope is going to contract the balloon is going to
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Lose altitude
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:15,647	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Drop out of the jet stream and down into the ocean all together
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So to solve this says Ross they what they did was this
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They took 32 sandbags
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Harlem on the balloon and then connected those sandbags to an altimeter set to a preset minimum such as 35
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Thousand feet in the nighttime
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Wind balloon
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Loses altitude
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,079	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The altimeter
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Will engage
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Trigger fuse
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Which cuts off one of those sandbags
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,735	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And dropped it into the ocean and now
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:47,135	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The vehicle will resend back into the jet stream cuz it's lighter cuz it's lighter so these
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Balloons the riding the jet stream a 10 every night they start to descend but then off we go a sandbag
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And then go back up and whenever they cooled off enough to drop same thing drop then rise
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Drop then rise
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Over and over
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	32 times until every sandbag was gone
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Once all the sandbags have been dropped
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Now you have
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Only the bombs remaining and the bombs are held in place
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	With the exact same mechanism is the sandbags
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And now by the very same system the bombs are the last to go
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:24,511	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And presumably the balloon is now somewhere over North America
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So it's a sandbag countdown
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	30
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	29
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,399	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	28
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	4
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	3
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	21 I hope I'm in Oregon right
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In what it was in Oregon or whatever the idea was that it would
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Drop its last bomb
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,431	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Float away
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In basically self-destruct
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They I guess figured it would be it would be more terrifying
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They have bombs raining down silently from above with no calling card at all
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Then with the Japanese calling card
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,703	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Sounds of the last time baggage drop
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,263	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Not only the central payload is left
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	This is audio from a declassify Navy instructional video made about these
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Balloon bombs in 1945
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Jesus soldiers
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	How to what to do if they find one of these bombs and how to Defuse The Bomb
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,719	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But I think the most interesting thing about the video is this text that's written in
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,487	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Huge
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Block letters
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,047	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Right at the bottom of the screen
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It says
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Do not eat the Enemy by publishing
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,935	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Or broadcasting or discussing
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Information
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Information
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Can be a powerful tool can be a powerful tool for good and a powerful tool for evil
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	This is Professor Mike Sweeney and I'm a historian of wartime censorship
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And he says that immediately after those first balloons landed there are few stories that appear in the local newspaper
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Farwest
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Stories about
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A Japanese attack
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	On the mainland of the United States
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Time in Newsweek even picked it up saying we're not sure what these are but you know are these the Japanese spies coming here
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And on these balloons this a large-scale attack what is going on
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:10,751	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And then
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Very shortly thereafter
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Just three days after this time and Newsweek article
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:18,687	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The office of censorship initiated a press blackout
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	This blackout on news
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They sent out memos in telegraph's to all the major wire services
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,879	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So you pdap in the ins
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:30,463	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Saying keep any news of these Japanese balloons

EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So the government's
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Ideas about why balloon Bob should be censored in particularly armies ideas were number one to avoid panic
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	These things are instruments of Terror right
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	You can't be afraid of something you don't know

EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,623	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Is avoid helping Japan
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It was thought then that if we printed exactly

EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Particular bomb Landing
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That this would help

EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Better Target
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The Bob and the reporters think about
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The gravel sometimes what they complied
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Everyone
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In the news industry was as patriotic as the rest of the country that is the vast majority of journalists supported the war
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Of course if you screwed up
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Can you send out a story that got American life skill you could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act for them or can you imagine what your listeners
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	We would do if you were the radio station if itis
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Killing 100 American sailors
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To the newspapers and radio stations kept their mouths shut
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Which meant that
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Most Americans
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Never even heard this was happening
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And more importantly the Japanese
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Weren't really hearing about whether they're bombs made it or not
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They probably concluded that it was basically a failed experiment which largely it was
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Of the 9000 released virtually none
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Cause any damage
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And certainly not any Terror except

EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I kid

EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Do you
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart

EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Right and the Reverend Archie Mitchell
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And his wife Chelsea

EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The church took occasionally up there they took their
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Sunday school class out for picnic there were five children that went along on that
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:35,616	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Ages 11 to 14 and one of the kids we called him Dicky
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	He had a crush on my sister who is Billy younger than me
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And they want her to come on this picnic so they came by and stop the pastor
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That's why I stopped the kids all piled up
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Ca Stockton weather
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Yeah trying to talk to convince my mom to let my sister go or both of us or whatever
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But Mom didn't want us to go cuz Saturday was our chore day
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:22:02,240	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And my day to work the switchboard which should usually make me pretty angry but it was my job
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And that
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:08,896	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	She said no. No weight while my sister didn't really want to go because she really wasn't
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Encouraging this relationship too much
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Educate ya
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	No
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So Archie and LZ and the five kids get back into the car they drove up to Gearhart Mountain a couple miles up a Logging Road
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Passing Forest Service guys working on the road they go a little further to where the road comes near Creek
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,912	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Can Archie pull the car around
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Impart
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The kid jumped out of the car and started running down towards the creek
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	LC
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Who was
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Pregnant as I mentioned that she was feeling a bit carsick
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	She jumped out
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,504	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To get some fresh air into chase after the kids
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	While Archie went around to the trunk of the car to get out the fishing poles in the picnic baskets Etc
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	One of the children
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Saw something on the ground
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A large
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Canvas
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	White grey balloon of some kind spread out on the ground
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Call of Duty other children to come have a look
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,568	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The children
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	NLC apparently gathered in a tight Circle
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Around the balloon
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Archi later reported that while he was getting the picnic basket out of
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The trunk
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	His wife called yuan
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,904	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Honey
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Come look at what we found
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	He turned and just took a few steps toward them
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And at that moment
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	We'll never know exactly what happened
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But apparently one of the children reach down to pick up
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The device
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The bomb detonated
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	All five children and Elsie Mitchell
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Were killed in
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:52,832	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The forest service guys down the road we're close enough to hear the blast they come running when they hear the explosion
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,624	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And they see
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Archie Mitchell has run to the site
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And his wife's
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Clothes were Ablaze
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And Archie was kneeling over his prostrate wife beating up the fire with his bare hands
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	On our last day in Bly we went to visit the site where the bomb went off
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The middle of nowhere
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It's just a chain
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Fenced off area
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A little pain
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And are these tall

EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And I thought my God what has happened and then when the he talked over the phone I knew what was going on he said they had had a ball
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Explode up there

EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Threatening to come in and

EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Except I set there
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,920	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	All day
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	16
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	You know I really really
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Tore me apart
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That was just in a complete fog for days
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Not ever
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Never talked too much about it
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Within a day or so the military told most of the town
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What actually happened that day
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And then a short time after that
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A big armies truck while I was too big army trucks and stop right out in front of our house
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,992	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	We wondered what was going on you know you're
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Little town like that anything different everybody goes to the window and takes a look
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	CARICOM
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Okay this is awfully hard
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	A woman and a little kid jumped out of the back of that truck
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	She was Japanese they were on their way to the tulelake
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The Japanese
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Internment camp nearby
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And she screaming and crying and praying
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Please we need water
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:38,016	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	We need water for it was thought it was really hot that day and they were in a canvas covered truck
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Jammed in there
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I grabbed the picture of a bucket or whatever was there in the kitchen
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Filled it with water and started out the door by that time they were
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Throwing rocks at that lady and her kid
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	People in that time we're so terribly
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Upset
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And they were throwing rocks at her
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And mom would let me go and I screamed and cried at my mother cuz she wouldn't let me go says you can't go out there they'll throw rocks
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,712	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I Won't Let You Go
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:12,064	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And did they stay that's pictures in my mind
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	And I pray to the Lord
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,416	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	To forgive the people that were doing that
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,232	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Try to
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I can't accept it there's nothing can make me accept what happened
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:33,056	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I thought that was the most horrible thing in the world people could do a woman and child that had nothing to do with the bomb
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Nothing to do with the ward nothing
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Still hard
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	How can people be that way
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It upset me so horribly bad
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What did want to talk about it
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,888	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I can talk for 40 years
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It's weird like
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Is a kind of weird
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Scary symmetry this whole thing like
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:17,344	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The Japanese
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Military
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Find crate
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Terror
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What they felt after
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So they want to make the situation where I like
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Bombs were falling silently from the sky we couldn't even tell where they're coming from
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:29,888	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Almost
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The gods were dropping
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But we kept it quiet
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,008	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Nobody panicked except
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	By not saying anything
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	At least in this one small incense
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I created exactly the situation that the Japanese military wanted
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:47,040	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Me not on the scale that they wanted but like and its effect
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:51,392	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It's like a concentrated version of the thing they're trying to create but that's the
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Problem
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That's not a problem
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	5 is
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,232	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	5 is a sacrifice
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:30:56,512	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What is it
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Five six people
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:00,864	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Yeah they're what they were there 125 million people
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I think I've been all the more than you can see
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	What it would have been like
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Listen to the store
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	You could see what it would be like if
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	If the story had been well-known
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I've Been Told
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:17,504	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Person to person
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Everybody was looking up and wondering
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	With the next
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Strange things coming from
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They wouldn't play with there might have been panic
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	But those kids wouldn't talk on the boulevard stats
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The choices they would have known
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Hey I'm sorry
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Jumping here I just know that we don't have Ross much longer
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	In order to respect your time
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Separates Randy Mills who worked with Nick and Peter on this
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	On story
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,288	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Before they kick you out
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The only last question I
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Out of my listings
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Like why is it that we don't know about
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I've never heard of this
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Before
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I don't know Robert Hugh farthest
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Sephora nearby quite why the hell is this not a thing we know
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:59,488	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	I think it's directly an outgrowth of that censorship policy
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	At the end of the war the war department destroyed all of the evidence they didn't want these any evidence of these bull
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Balloons
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,960	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Just out there in general circulation
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,264	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	This is one of those
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Footnotes to the war
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That you know at the end of the war
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Just never
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	People people forgot about something that they didn't know about anyway
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,576	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Ross are there any more out there
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:27,136	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That is a very interesting question
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	It's estimated by the war department
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,536	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That of the 9000 release
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	They thought that maybe 7 to 10%
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,888	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Of the total
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,168	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Would have survived
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,728	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	The transoceanic Crossing in arrived in North America
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	That's 900
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:45,568	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	300r confirmed
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	As having arrived in North America
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	So that means there are
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Dozens
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,176	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Perhaps
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19fugo |	Hundreds
