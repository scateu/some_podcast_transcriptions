EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:12,448	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	So as I've done for decades now I went over his house in Manhattan with my mic

EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:15,776	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I just need to know what just
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,104	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	A month-and-a-half ago you were fine
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:20,640	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:21,152	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,504	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I see beginning of the ride was fine
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,832	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	On the 3rd of January I feel Canelo
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:29,344	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Quia
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:32,160	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I tossed some dark urine
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:35,232	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I thought I said little girl bladder attack
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,560	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Didn't pay that much attention
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,608	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But thought I better get things
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,656	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:44,704	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The X-ray with
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,520	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Expected only to show a couple of ghosts
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,312	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Chode
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:49,824	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I'm drugs
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,360	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Off 6th
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,640	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And my liver
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,992	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Iolo my doctor said
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:59,808	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He didn't know what his will and I would need further tests
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,112	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I knew what they were
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,648	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I said it's hot
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:08,000	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He's right the doctors eventually confirmed
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:12,864	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	A cancer that has been found in his eye 9 years ago had spread to his liver
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Were you
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,704	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Peyton
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,216	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Or
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:22,848	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Relieve or consor
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:27,200	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I think my first feeling was one of
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,224	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Overwhelming sadness
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,320	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	They're also things
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,856	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I will see
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,160	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I will do
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,464	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	One or two people have listened to me in the
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:41,792	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Controlling me
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,352	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But f*** it it's not like we all die
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,144	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It's like you have four months
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:56,384	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Has that has your property is your prognosis at this moment cuz I know you had an well if it gets revived
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,968	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It depends of course on how is the cancer response to treatment sand
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,248	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Or how quickly it spreads
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Sofa
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,368	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The metastasis from my eye
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:07,392	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Only in my liver
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I told they love liver
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,768	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The Isle of liver as well
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:16,608	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then one of the magical things I did was going to have to live for Nom Noms
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:19,936	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Sudoku
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:23,264	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I'm thinking that liver looks better than mine Parkway
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:29,664	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	This is what he's like instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him he's thinking about loving liver and liver lover
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,992	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Looking for Connections in one really doesn't stop he
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,784	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He just notices it case in point
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	A few months ago
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,624	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	His doctor said to him We're going to run up a line
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:44,256	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Up your liver and ineffective going to straight shave off or start some of the cancer cells first on one side
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,304	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Going to be out there to see if I can give you a little more time
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,632	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But they warned him honesty metastasis
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:50,400	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Die
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,960	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The hutong farias and Pleasanton
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,520	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Send me exhaust you text your system bad
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,616	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And at one point shortly after the procedures
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I started talking and it off
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:01,920	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Strangely
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,504	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And as I was talking I was inviting
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You'll be the first person to see this
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:14,208	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	So he showed me a notebook we're showing it to you
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,256	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In just a moment you can see their sort of
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:21,887	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Writing there on the left it's all he's writing a book actually children's book about the elementary table
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,959	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But as he was writing if you if you look to the next
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,983	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Page
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,519	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I see that it gets a little bit
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,335	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Wobbly the letters and then
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,127	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then there was some
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,919	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Crossing out there
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,223	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Yes I see all the dramatics
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:37,759	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Do icing
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,527	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Changes
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It actually is
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:40,575	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	There's a large
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:45,439	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Slash across it and then you get seems a little incoherent at the palace
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:48,511	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Okay
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Edible
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:50,815	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Advantage delivery
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Krypton made
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,679	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	All this happened to the course of 10 minutes
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:05:00,287	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He's doing here he's figured okay I'm writing at a constant speed
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:06,687	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I know pretty much how fast I write and so I can time this out I can figure out exactly how long it took me to sleep
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:12,831	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Into delirium out of this delirium
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,391	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Animal Medical Way
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:17,439	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I think this was a lovely illustration
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,511	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Who puts in a timeline of delirium
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,815	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Coming like that
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	When are you more likely
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:31,263	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Unusual for any doctor and a man of science you don't seem too worried at all
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,311	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Become incoherent or strange
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:38,175	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You're not showing it to me as it's like how interesting I was crazy here for a little bit
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:44,063	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:49,183	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I went time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike and by the way I I should
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Show you what you look like back then when he was
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,535	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Driving his bike is I think it's him
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,303	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In New York
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I kind of you know
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Hello
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:03,519	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In the sixties he was also a champion weightlifter they called him doctor Squad
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:08,895	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And in this picture that you saw you here that's him raising 600-lb
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:12,223	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In order to win a trophy like this is that that you was a champ and
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:18,111	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And you can see more pictures like these cuz we have signed copies of all of his new Memoir out for sale in the lobby
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:21,951	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Pretty good book too by the way this time
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And 1960s
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:26,559	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In addition to being muscled out however
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Was a serious recreational drug take
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:30,655	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And because he's Oliver
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:34,239	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He was extremely curious about his high as no matter how weird they were
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,287	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	1 time for example he took
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,079	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	20 pills that he shouldn't have
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,151	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then to my surprise
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,991	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	How does a spider on the wall
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Set hello
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Have a voice like that she's also
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,879	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Famous mathematician
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,159	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And the tongue
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,999	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It cost me a lot of the technical question as to whether Russell had a
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Exploded
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,047	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Frigga spavital
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,351	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And we had this
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:07,007	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Conversation
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,311	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Cuz you you trust your perceptions
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,687	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Mineo's later when I mentioned this to an entomologist friend Cornell
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,991	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Philosophical spider
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:26,207	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Taking it all in talking spiders
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,279	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Whatever the generosity of his curiosity
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:32,095	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Becomes profoundly moving and transformative
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,143	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What he's treating his patients I want to tell
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,215	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	1 * here really quickly do to demonstrate what I mean
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,287	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I never once had a patient when he called mrs. OC
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,103	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	She was
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:46,431	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	An old woman she was 88 years old living in a nursing home
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,039	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And one night she was awakened Jarred awake by a loud sound
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,063	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I wish
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,743	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Hillsong
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,815	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And she thought about somebody left the radio on but when she looked
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	3D when the room is Oscar roommate
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:09,983	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Soundasleep which was odd because the song was really loud
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,823	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The doors after that
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,103	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It was another song
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Another song
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:25,087	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Leaving my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,159	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Are coming to the fillings in my teeth I've heard that's possible
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But no her doctor told her
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,767	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	This is something in your head you need to see
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,279	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	A neurology
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Which led her to doctor sax
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:44,031	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	That when he met mrs. OC he she could barely hear him the song sung by the female voice for coming and coming she
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:50,431	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He was frightened and justifiably worried that you was going crazy but Oliver said no no I'm going to do some tests and when he was done
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:56,831	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He said he found a slight stroke or condition that triggered musical epilepsy 87 production of music and
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,343	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Your brain
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:03,999	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Normal. You might say Okay me about the diagnosis and he thought that the songs would probably faint it'll pass or they would be
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,047	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But Oliver did not stop
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,839	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He doesn't stop
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:12,191	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He kept talking to her
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:19,103	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born her mother when she
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,967	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He was only 5 she was sent to America
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,783	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Look for the water for beating Mason.
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:31,647	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	She had no conscious memory of the first five years of my life
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,719	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	New memory of Ireland
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,535	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You should always help us as a kid and painful side
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Lack of forgetting
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Efficacy
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,959	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	We asked her about the songs
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What are they like
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,311	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I miss Associated well I think they're lullabies
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,615	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Can you sing them for me she did
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,991	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then after checking them not sure who I'll ever figured out that these songs what happened to be popular
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:01,599	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Irish ballads from the 1890s when Mrs OC was a little baby
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,135	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I gave him an idea
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:05,183	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Isn't science
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It isn't in any traditional way medicine
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,047	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He just told her a story
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:10,559	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And it goes like this
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:15,167	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You don't have nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:20,543	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Well there was a Siri wants not honored much today but it's sad that those earliest memories
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,615	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Get locked away deep in our brains in a special safe
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:24,895	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The weekend never open
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	So let's suppose mrs. OC
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,991	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And you are struck by some
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Reezy chance
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,575	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Open the lock that none of us can break
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And release those first memories
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,927	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In you just for a little while
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,487	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	So that the voice you're listening to
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,023	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Home
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Maybe that isn't a radio voice
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,703	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Let's play
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	That it's your mother's voice
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	That's true missing mother
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,383	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Enjoy the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,431	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You get to be a baby again
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:59,711	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Images of the Seas thought about
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,527	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Okay
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,807	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It's sort of fits
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,111	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I'm an old woman with a stroke
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,903	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Can an old people's home
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But I feel I'm a child in Ireland
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,791	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I feel my mother's arms I see
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,071	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Ikea voicing
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,887	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	United
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,103	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Shortly thereafter the songs began to fade the pauses widen
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,943	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Miss Associated been so frightened by this music in her head was now
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Sorry to see the songs go
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,319	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But it was Oliver who noticed how those songs that touched
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:41,183	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He listens close
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He can hear another person's
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:47,839	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And this is really the profound puzzles for me
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	About Oliver
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:55,263	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Because reading the new autobiography you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,567	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Linear relationships that really mattered
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:59,359	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It turns out he didn't get a whole lot of effect
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:03,455	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He was for a long time a lonely guy I'd say he was
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Very lonely
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,039	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And he's talking about that now for the 1st
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,367	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Let me talk about love for a minute
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,207	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In this book you tell the story of your
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,023	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Of your very first love of fellow by the name of Richard
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,535	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Selleck
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,095	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Can you just tell me
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What happened with
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,983	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He was a load Scala I talked with him.
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,007	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	A poet
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And handsome
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Beautiful
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,847	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Beyond belief
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	An eyesore
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Fell for him
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,759	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Although I didn't say anything
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Because I was from
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,623	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Very haunted by my mother
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Accusations
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What is your mother
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,719	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Well
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:50,047	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	To go to a couple of years back then my father
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	How to open the conversation I was about to go to Oxford
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:54,911	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Father son
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Conversation
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,727	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Any setup
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	You don't seem to have many girlfriends
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:01,567	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I said
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,591	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	No
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Wishing the conversation
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,151	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Stop
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,943	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He said I'm
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,735	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Something's wrong with girls
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Semi I said know that that's fine
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,831	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Tattoo prefer boys
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,367	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I said well
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Yes I do
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I said I've never done anything
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,719	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But I do
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:23,327	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Then you knew that then I knew that then I'd know.
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	6 euros
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Probably sometime
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,143	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	What's 12
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,471	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I said don't tell Mom
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	She won't be able to take it
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But my
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Father
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Did tell my mother in the night
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,967	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And the next morning she came down with him
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,783	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I somehow want to see the face of humba
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,831	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Enraged me
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,623	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And among other things said
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,951	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Joann Abomination I wish you would never been born
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,511	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And then she has something to shut up
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,071	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And said nothing for 3 days
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,751	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	The match was never mentioned the game and highlight
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,567	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Anthem
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,591	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	2 years later
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,615	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I found myself
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,895	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	First time in my life
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,663	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Falling in Love
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,223	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	This was the gun guy Richard
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:13,759	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Oliver the time was in college
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:18,111	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	It was a very positive feeling why didn't know what it was one which I did Express
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,903	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But I did
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,951	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Say so with my heart my mouth
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:26,047	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	To what you said
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And Richard
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,935	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Clipped me by the shoulders and he said I know
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,239	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	He said but I'm not that way
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,543	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But I love you in my own way
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:43,199	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I was glad I have said that I'm glad this has been received in such a warm February
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,759	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	I thought you might be friends for the rest of all
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,271	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Lives
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:51,391	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	But then one day he came into me said he'd been bothered by finding a lump
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,951	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	In his groin and he was worried
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,487	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Could I have a look at it
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,815	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And I looked at it and I felt it
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	And it was hard on
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:01,375	| rl_extras15rememberingoliver |	Tethered
