EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:06,400	00:00:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:23,296	00:00:26,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So we can start with a story for my producer Pat Walters
EDL	00:00:26,624	00:00:27,392	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	About a couple
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh my word
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:30,208	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay so
EDL	00:00:30,976	00:00:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I mentioned a couple episodes ago
EDL	00:00:33,024	00:00:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	By the way this is Chad Radiolab.
EDL	00:00:35,328	00:00:39,936	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Will be bringing back some episodes back to the flow from time to time episodes that we haven't
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:44,800	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Stop thinking about the field true or to us now than before maybe the opposite
EDL	00:00:44,800	00:00:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	New episodes
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We still end up getting two fights with people about and a couple years ago we ran a story about a guy named Kevin
EDL	00:00:52,992	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A little bit more recently hello Robert are you there
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:00:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yes snake gentle be here in just a sec
EDL	00:00:58,880	00:01:02,720	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Robert sapolsky Stanford who
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:05,536	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	College and I have had on the show many times
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,584	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Seriously would have booked
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:11,936	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Which makes an argument that really tries to kind of just explode
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That story
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,776	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Anyway that we found her dancers
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was just my hunch
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That it plays near a lot of your button
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sure does
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So what we did was we sent him that piece having listened to it
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	NXT will do now is Replay that piece and then at the end
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We'll come back and
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:33,952	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A little bit of a fight about it
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So we can start
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,560	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	With a story for my producer Pat Walters about a couple
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh my word
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The lady and Shannon
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is the guy I don't need you to introduce yourself that's usually the thing we do but we're not dumb people who you are
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We're going to call him Kevin Kevin yeah yeah yeah that's
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah that's my name
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:55,712	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's suspicious at all it's not his real name
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No make sense why we're not using his real name
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay but this one starts a few summers ago
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was July 2006
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Dan and Kevin went home
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,208	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Some people
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You don't know
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Chill up and maybe I'll start with you
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When they show up at the door
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So we were it was we were getting ready to go down the shore was a Friday so we so we're in the kitchen and and they
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Come to the back door but I thought that I thought they were fundraising
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:26,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I thought they might even firemen just by you not that the blue the blue shirt and then realize that
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That they were

EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They took me outside and they asked me to stay in the kitchen
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And they had a woman with me
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I didn't know it was going to nobody said anything to me sing to you on the porch
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,288	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Meanwhile
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When they when they showed up
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I got to the door
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:02,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I said you know why we're here I said yeah I do I was expecting you
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I showed him everything was
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This story about Kevin and his wife Janet inspired us to do the entire hour cuz it when was
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Basic things that we do
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is we judge
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You just want another judge what's right
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What's wrong with this story of the two that follow
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They will make you judge how you judge
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At least they have that effect on us
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can I show
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Blink

EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,368	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You should know that this show contains some graphic
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Difficult descriptions in a few
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:40,928	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Teaspots
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Turn on the mood or if you have kids around
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You might want to sit this one out
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay so what happened in that first scene and what happens next
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Only makes sense
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If we go back there
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The first
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	About 15 years
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's just an ordinary day Kevin
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Going home from work
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I was
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Driving home
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:05,248	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Going about 65 70 in the fast lane
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Suddenly
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There was a thump
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In my chest then he just that I hate voting
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	After that he said suddenly he had this thickness in my tongue in my throat and a foul taste in his mouth
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,935	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Then
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	My hearing
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Spit it out
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Enneathought
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Its back
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If I did come to
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He sees his car smashed into the side of an
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I do recall the officers, you've been in an accident you better than any members want them insisted that he soon
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Smelled alcohol
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I was talking through clenched teeth cuz I had bit my tongue and
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And my cheeks
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I was saying over and over again
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I had a seizure
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I had a seizure
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin Scott epilepsy
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's had it since he was a teenager
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But two years before this all happened he had surgery to remove the part of his brain that was causing the seizures
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	End
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It seemed to work to be doing great eventually wasn't having seizures anymore
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Until suddenly with you
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He was
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Lost your license I lost my license for a year things have kind of taken a nosedive like here he is he's 35
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	5 years old I'm living with my brother I'm divorced
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,263	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I have to call my Daddy and ask him now
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To drive me to and from work
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you saying
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I need to do something this is not sustainable
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,711	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Now don't don't need that
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So I walked into the office at HR person where he works
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Export a list of all the employees
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Give me a list of everybody who were the front so she pulled it up I go down the list and I get to Janet Woodruff Bloomfield
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Only one asteroid close to me 5 minutes away
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So I walk
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To work you
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Knocked on the on the wall
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Introduce myself
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like hey my name is Kevin
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,543	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	House of work here
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I got this thing though
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's kind of awkward I can't drive
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I was wondering if
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You give me a ride
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She said yes
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:21,439	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I really pass by his street I mean on the way to work so it was
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Right on History pretty much but I made it clear and you know I'll do it when I can start talking finding out
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Little bit more about each other
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Notice pretty quickly we like the same music that was unique because I sort of
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like music that was probably more in his error Kevin was 7 years older than what kind of music are you listening to
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Jackson Browne mostly lie detector on James Taylor
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Bonnie Raitt it's a little you know Elton John
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They found themselves
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sing along to the lyrics
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,791	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You cannot sing
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	With somebody
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Day in and day out
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And not have something
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We want them as a spring came you know it's getting nice out so now it's like well let's not go home as well for a beer after work we're becoming
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,079	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We'd like each other over Kevin
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was a little more serious than that
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm thinking about her and I'm starting to wake up at night and what day in May is Jenna is dropping him off

EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:34,143	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nicest restaurant in town so your friend takes you to a 4-star restaurant you're thinking right away
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He thinks this is a date come on now I'm panic-stricken we have our dinner we leave
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She drops me off and I handed her the poem
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What is the poem say
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You still have it
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah I do
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay this is a little slower
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Each time we sing on the way home
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,111	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I pray that traffic backs up
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So we can sing together
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,439	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Just a little longer
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the harmony can go on forever
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And each time you reach my door
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I feel robbed
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Because we're always admit song
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Amidst thought
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Only he gets out and goes inside and try things awesome I gave her the phone she's going to be so
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Smitten with me and you go home and what
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Want to throw up
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I just thought I'd got it you know
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Next day I just looked at him and said listen we got to clarify this
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is clearly just going to be a friendship
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He was 7 years older than me he had to
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Your brain
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know surgery he has epilepsy
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's divorced he has two children
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Try and try and he's just like
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm not asking you to marry me
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm asking you go out on a few dates
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I can go out with me like four times in the next 6 months
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm ahead of the game just handled it
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Then I don't think it was long at all I can't even remember but it wasn't long at all before we were like
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A couple
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And Kevin I'm Dopey
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Ethiopian love romantic things for her all the time
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Flowers poems and illustration of the Jackson Browne cover Anthony year
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	All the while Kevin is having seizures since the car accident
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was a point where we were obviously Dayton
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Japanese make his bed and
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He said she pulled up the pillowcase
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Covered with blood stain
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	1 2 3
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	4 5 6 7 and count the number of seizures that I had
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In between my tongue and bled I knew nothing about
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Epilepsy
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I never seen anybody have a seizure in my past those would have been big red flags that I would have just walked away but
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I just went with it
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And they both want with it
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	50 years
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Until finally Kevin agenda side
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is not what I wanted to be done with it
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I just needed to be done with it
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To reschedule a brain surgery
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Which sounds like a big deal and obviously it is but they had every reason to think that this wouldn't change him
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I honestly thought that he was going to come out of it fine a better
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Quebec map in the first time giving head actually gone through a brain surgery much like this one once before
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Any come out
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pretty much the same guy you still himself
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In fact
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He made sure of it
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,519	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I had a I was awake for the surgery
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's crazy
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was had to be awake
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Had to do with me
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin is a musician
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the doctors told him they said that if I lost anything I was going to lose my appreciation for music
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That it would be like music with the white noise
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pasadena now for me music was
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is part of my personality
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was how I cope with
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	My Darkest
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Moments in dealing with epilepsy and seizures
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At 18 years old
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I have a seizure
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I take whatever Monica and I find a place
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Decent Reverb somewhere and be right where I needed to be
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I didn't want to lose that part of me
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do I have the doctors were doing the brain surgery that had his head open bathroom to sing remember what you saying
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	End of the Innocence
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Some James Taylor
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	While he's saying they would tickle
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Different parts of his brain
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If you ever touch the part that made him stop singing
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They say okay that's a part we cannot take out
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Wow
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And in the end I think they ended up taking out like 4 and 1/2 cm
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like a little bit of a bigger than a golf ball well but afterwards that he was recovering the I had my keyboard in the
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I tried playing right away data data data data.
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It works
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Partying that you really cared about
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Was still there exactly after the first surgery so
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I thought well you know
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,143	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	None of the country's second surgery he's already been down this road
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We're fine
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And after that second surgery
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Editing by Janet didn't have her brother
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sneak my my keyboard up to the room again very very adamant that he wanted that keyboard
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Just noodles a couple of notes played a couple of things and it was like okay I'm there
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Tell me I was ready to go
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To you go home and like
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It seems to have worked
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah for seizures go we thought okay this is it we're home free and I was just happy to have some normalcy
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then in the winter by beginning the middle of January
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin knows he wanted to eat my physical appetite
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A lot more than usual. Like insane
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Or maybe a snack that was it but now I could eat the couch
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It just was I thought it was not him normally but you know you're like okay
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then the piano
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You play the piano for hours
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sing songs to sing in the car together he has stuck on a piece
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He would play it for hours
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	How many hours
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Eight nine
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And then
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No sex
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know we were happy
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Healthy couple
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin's nodding
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What was abnormal was it was it was anywhere clearly wasn't like all we're in the supermarket let's have sex here
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I mean it wasn't like that but I mean it was like
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I could just walk in the kitchen I'm an out-of-work and helical you let's go here
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Which structure is weird
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then again we were thinking you know let's try to have a family make things confusing
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And what's in that it wasn't like any of this stuff was out of character exactly
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fact
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:31,263	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was all stuff.
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:36,383	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She liked about him yeah that was all turned up to 11 all the things that were wonderful
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Became tours
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And that's pretty much where things are at
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When is federal agent showed up in July 2000
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I was just completely blindsided

EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And they arrested him
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	For what was on that computer
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I gave it up to him
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Right away
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Warning this next batch

EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then I read some of the
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The court documents in
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They were like

EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Thanks
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You can imagine
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Infants on throw
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah pretty

EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Did it right and you bought this
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And put them on your
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Computer eye
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,647	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah it it it bothers me
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It bothers me
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like I said initially it was and I was just your basic your basic
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know how to roast heterosexual Playboy like Penthouse like

EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,727	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And then
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Windows would just start to open up pretty soon he says
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's going every
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was gay sex they were for me that there was due is bondage there was
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:20,575	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Defecation sex there was a********* is Zeno sex
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,111	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I went everywhere
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That a button came up
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The Porsche

EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:34,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He said Disturbed you and you feel terrible. I just like Wonder like how do you
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:38,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do you tell yourself like that wasn't me like how do you
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Explain it to yourself to
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So that you can kind of
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I'm not feel like you're
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:46,431	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	As bad as
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,479	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The person who goes there
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Without a brain injury
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know like
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Say that again I guess I'm just wondering I don't know like knowing that the thing that you did and it sounds like obviously you know that that was bad
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Ever the wrong thing
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Terrible thing
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But it was
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,823	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was you who did it or was it not
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I don't know you going to mean
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No it was it was me who did it but it was me
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	With a
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,503	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Complete lack
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,319	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Under a logical control
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Not I mean I know
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I know who I am
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I did idiotic things that I couldn't stop myself from doing I didn't want to do it
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It would be nice where would be 456 hours of going to the same site and end in
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Downloading one or two files and then deleting them
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Going back
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A minute later
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Downloading the same files deleting them
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I would download those files a dozen times and delete him a dozen times cuz I didn't want to be there knew I shouldn't be there in
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,159	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And couldn't help myself from going back
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm not an idiot
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I mean I'm on the smart guy I'm not an idiot
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I know I had no control
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Ineptitude arguing Court
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can we plead guilty but at the sentencing hearing he asked the judge to be lenient
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Arguing isn't played that the person who did all those things in some sense
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Wasn't him
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was some other part of
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	His brain that he couldn't control
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Play the hearing he called one witness
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Orrin devinsky I'm a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Even treating Kevin for decades 20 20 some odd years
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And he says as soon as he found out what Kevin had been doing had a terrible sense of
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Of responsibility this is because the brain surgery
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The surgery on recommended he have
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Target in court that this was not Kevin's fault
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I remember looking at those agents right in their face
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And sing to them and to the judge
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This could be anybody this could be those agents judge this could be you this could be me this could be anybody
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And we would have no control over what we did
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Explain to the court what the biology was
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That the way the brain is working that is it there parts of our brain that are way deep down
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The control
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,167	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Base desire
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Mike hunger

EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:26,943	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Most of us are kept in check because there are other parts of our brain that sit on top
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And act like a lid
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Bank Evans case
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The brain surgeon you did that surgery
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Remove part of that filter
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And suddenly the cork was off I mean it was just no lid
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	On his sexual desires he's a scientist
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Condition for a long time difference. In monkeys
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The rhesus monkeys when the monkeys would lose roughly the same part of the brain that Kevin laws they became very hyper sexual males
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:59,199	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It would only previously be sexually involved with females
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Now we're ten times more sexually active with both males and females
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	David feels too meme
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Feels to me like there's a
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It would be a brighter line
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Before
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kids
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I think
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There is a line for quote-unquote normal individuals
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But in a brain disorder case those lines get blurred
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And he told the court
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's what happened here was black and white can with sick
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	End behavior without his control
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Well
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's not what
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The facts showed
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In this case
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is Lee Vartan what's the
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We saw no evidence of impulsivity
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He says if you're claiming that he had no control that his brain made him do it then how come he had all this c********* on his home computer
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I believe it was
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	52 videos and 125 images on his work computer images
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	0 videos of child Pornography on his work computer
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you worked a lot
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He held down a job he was working everyday
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If you truly lack impulse control I would think
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You would see
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Child pronography on both computer
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nobody argued back was
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:11,135	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What with the lid on at work and off at home seems to me to be an easy out
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The answer is that this is common with neurologic
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Disease
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They tend not to be
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	24/7
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If it's taken to make tourettes some people when they're engaged and playing sports
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They tend not to have pics
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Redlands didn't ground for distress
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They do that.
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So you could say well-dressed clearly isn't a neurological disorder but no Tourette's is a neurologic disorder we understand
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Some of the brain things that go on Tourette's
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The prosecution didn't buy it
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Thought it was hogwash
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What was hogwash was his level of certainty
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Breskis and ask the Kevin be sent to prison for 5 years
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Isn't paying for c********* you supporting industry
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:54,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It does terrible things to kids
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin Oakes YouTube or jail time altogether and instead you placed on house arrest

EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	One of the questions he asked was this marriage going to survive this
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I said
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And at that point understand I didn't even know
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The level of picture
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But she said the moment she heard orange say that this was a brain disorder with the name
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kluver bucy syndrome once I was able to
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Get that for me
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A click like
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:35,616	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You complain that we have these experts saying that
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was a disease and I kept thinking they'll understand
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,064	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Give him some medication and dances
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was like flipping a switch
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's exactly what it was was like yeah yeah and back
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's Able I was able to sit and watch a movie with
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know normal
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Did it actually says in a lot of ways those few months
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Between the arrest
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In the sentencing hearing
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Baton
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:04,288	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The best months in a marriage he now is just so much easier,
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You could we just talk
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:10,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The hearing took about 3 hours and when it was over the judge took a recess
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Winter Chambers
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When she came back
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She delivered your decision
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And we'll hear that decision when we come back
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Traffic break

EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting the show
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Brilliance
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:04,704	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It just means you bring back and say whoa
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,184	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Epic moments where
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kid does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If you have a story with us
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fan that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Rod this is Radiolab we're revisiting Pat Walter story about Kevin and when we left
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The judge was just about to render her decision
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She actually wouldn't talk to me for the story but I have the transcript from the
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Hearing
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And if you remember the prosecutor Bolivar 10 was asking for 5 years
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	63 months
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Meaning no jail time there's no way this is clear-cut
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can use with the judge.
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She says I do agree with orange it is a neurological disorder real question we can't be held fully responsible for
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Behavior she was getting
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And she said the prosecution did have a point that
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He was very much in control of his impulse
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At least some of the
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I took the question for the judge was how does the legal system assign blame
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When a person is sometimes can selves and in control
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sometimes not
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,504	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is a crime she said
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A crime which ultimately leads to children being hired and considering that you did have moments where you were in control
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But in those moments
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Responsibility
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You could have done something
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Girl ask for help
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:10,144	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You could have told the people around you what you were doing so even if you couldn't have stopped
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Takers.
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,520	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	She made it very clear
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That we have to do something here
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sentence
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	26 months
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At a federal prison
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And 25 months house arrest
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I I believe I believe that she she was she was fair
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I believe she was compassionate
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	About a week before Christmas
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In 2008
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Introverted person
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	How long was he in jail for about 2 years
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And she was even though the judge said you know
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He is responsible to that
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Change her attitude toward him at all now
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Totally stuck together she doesn't it
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,128	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pretty much every weekend
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The whole time
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:56,480	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I knew the rude and I had my own little routine down
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In between visits in the notes he could send me mail that a store where he could get some cards
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Super Walmart
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And he would like alter them
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I've ever remember the very first card I got
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It was this very you know
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Beautiful supposedly supposed to be beautiful but it was like you know if you need anything
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You anything at all just let me know and then he writes
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Of course if it's pressing you might want to ask someone else cuz you can wait 24 months
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I remember getting that and just laughing and then that became our thing like listen this is a horrible situation
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But we're going to make the best of
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,320	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Tell me a little bit about like
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:39,488	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Where things are at now are almost normal
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm still
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	On probation he's home he's working
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Life is going on we have our normal routines
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can still take those medicines that
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Keep that other part of him in check
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I have no libido at all
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I know who I am
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I know what I am
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm disturbed by that portion of my life
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But I'm trying I'm trying to move on
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Producer Pat Walters
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sew-in no nothing about your reaction to that will be which is my hunch is author Roberts
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That it's sort of
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It plays near a lot of your butt
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,648	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Where does yeah
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And know why we always felt
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:46,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The at the end of the story the sentence that Kevin gets from the judge was this kind of
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Interesting in Nuance balance
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Between
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know the idea that he just had a brain disease and the idea that there's some still Center of personal responsibility involved
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:28:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	All right out of the gate sapolsky had a different reaction, Paul
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Underlying worldview
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Really
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah completely
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And for him it all centered around that sort of
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,600	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Key argument
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This way the judge
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:14,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's some of the time he can control these urges
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And some of the time he can't
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The example and there was that never once it worked if you do anything like that and DFCS
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You spend hours each night at home
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the fact that he could control it and other circumstances
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Does that mean there is a separate me inside there
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:34,944	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's able to get to the control panel some of the time but not others
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And thus
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Punishable
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah it said it's like
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's in a kind of
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pitched battle
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	With some
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Inner urge that he has maybe two biological urge
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sometimes he wins maybe in the morning when he sets
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The coffee and he's like nicely sugared up
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then at night we all know this when we get tonight or if we're tired by brains are tired
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:03,104	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And we the it comes out a tiny little bit well let's
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Let's translate what you just said
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Industry nuts-and-bolts biology
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Your frontal cortex
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:14,368	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Which is making you do the harder things when's the right thing to do is one of the most
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,904	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Expensive parts of the brain to operate
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,696	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And when
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,232	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You're starting to get hungry
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Are you starting to get tired
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,072	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Your frontal cortex doesn't work as well
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And that's simply why
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We have less regulation of our behavior in at night than in the morning
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the perfect neurological example where nobody would invoke Free Will in this one is he
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You look at somebody with alzheimer's disease
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Beverly stage Alzheimer's disease
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They sure was sundra a sundowner syndrome
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Which is in the morning they can tell you what their name is
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And by night they can't tell you
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:50,720	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the next morning they can tell you again
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Wow
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Are we here sort of
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A choice okay so they know their name and if they're not telling you at night they know their name they can tell you
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Username in the morning if they're not telling it to you at night they're choosing not to
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:13,248	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What happens at night is blood sugar levels drop and the brain is tired and the frontal cortex which has to do the
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,832	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like what was my name again with three-and-a-half remaining neurons
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can't do it as well
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nobody looks at that and says there's volition
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:24,000	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They can do it part of the day
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They should be expected to be able to do it and that's that. That's because it's a different issue I mean this isn't what you're talking about memory
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay so let me let me
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Let me go through a sequence here that I am they obviously
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:38,336	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Prepared for the occasion
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In the in the Kevin segment they made mention of the syndrome that he has which
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,528	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Call the kluver Bucy syndrome
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And this was first shown in the 1940s you going to monkeys
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you take out the same part of the frontal cortex
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	As they did with Kevin and you kept monkeys that eat themselves into obesity now they can't stop eating
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:05,472	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Affair hyper-sexual male trying to mount everyone and everything on Earth
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can right off the bat we see some broad similarities haha you will say though
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But Kevin has a moral system Kevin has
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Meta control Kevin as we saw
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:21,856	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Give control in some circumstances but not in others
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We've left the world of blameless monkeys far behind
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:30,560	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yes yes yes yes goodbye but we have not you've got a monkey there
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Who's got frontal damage and now is hyper sexual
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's attempting to mount infants he's attempting to mount water bottles in his cage
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Completely out of control
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But nonetheless
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He doesn't try to mount the alpha male
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Obviously what we have here is a monkey who has free will
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Because of some circumstances
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He could not do this
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Bad inappropriate thing cuz he's got free will Sumter
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No that's ridiculous okay let's
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's not that he
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Could control his behavior
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Some of the time it said in this instance
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He was under the influence of something else
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,960	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That he couldn't control
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fear
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:16,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fear of the alpha male activation of fear circuits override the feeble attempts of those for
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And a half remaining from Ponder on interesting regulation in one circumstance but not in others not because there's
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Free will or rotten choices or bad values
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is biologically broken system manifest is broken.
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Under some circumstances but not others and
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:36,864	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There's a logical biological explanation for why you get those exception
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,168	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But you're talking about monkeys and one situation we're not closer to home now
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So you sit down somebody with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you put
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The frontal lobe damage patient now in a circumstance where they're in
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A situation
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:58,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Where
EDL	00:32:58,624	00:33:02,208	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There's a smarter more disciplined better pay off thing to do
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And they can do it just fine
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But then you get them emotionally aroused over something or you get them tired they're horrible terrible compared
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Two regular folks
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Another words
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:20,128	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We've just progressed from okay the monkey if it's scared of the alpha male okay
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fear
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Can override the neurons that has remaining in there and they're swamped
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Now we've seen in a human more in general
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Strong emotions can override
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,904	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But that so so far what you told me though
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:37,792	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sometimes I have the resources to choose and sometimes I don't but it's about the resource
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	For the choice
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Doesn't
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Not exist
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In there
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:44,448	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Next Step
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,240	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Next Step Closer in
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:53,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So for my money one of them
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:58,528	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I even have a clipboard here I've been sitting in front of me that's how much I prepared for this
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay here's an example
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You take a Drudge
EDL	00:34:03,136	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like this
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Classic
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Important study
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you look at the single biggest predictor
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Of whether or not this parole board judge and this was
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The whole panel of judges
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Whether they will vote for somebody being paroled or not
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The single best predictor was how many hours has it been since the judge has eaten
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:30,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What you mean is that a hungry judge will not give parole to someone but a full
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:34,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And happy tummy tea in the judge will make it make the judge more gentle
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:37,696	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You look at the study and right after a meal
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Are convicts had about a 90% chance of being paroled
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And right before meal they were down to about a 10% chance and was a virtually straight line going down X
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,936	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Messed up
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you know
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The single biggest
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is Purdue episode up the study up and it turns out if the judge was making the decision
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,616	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Right after lunch when they're full
EDL	00:34:56,128	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Parolees had about a 60%
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Chance of getting pearls okay not as bad as you say
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If the judges were making the decision right beef
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:08,160	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	For the next meal like when they were hungry
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:10,976	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Parolees had close to a 0
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Percent chance of getting parole
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,304	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What's interesting about
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,376	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Number one the biology make
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:18,144	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Perfect sense
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:25,056	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What are you doing there when you are a judge trying to judge somebody from a completely different world from you to reach
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,592	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Your point of deciding
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:31,200	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There's mitigating factors you're trying to take their perspective you were trying to
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:34,016	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Think about the indirect ways that Lit
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,064	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You're using your frontal cortex
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:37,088	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And when you're hungry
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:42,976	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And your frontal cortex isn't is working as well it's easier to make a snap emotional judgment
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is person's rotten
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:47,840	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The second amazing thing which exactly addresses this issue is
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You get that judge
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	2 seconds after they made that decision
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:56,544	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You sit him down at that point and say hey so why did you make that decision
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And their get a quote on a no Immanuel Kant or Alan dershowitz that you they're going to
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Post hoc
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Come up with an explanation that has all the pseudo trappings of
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:12,672	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Free Will and volition and in reality it just rationalization
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Totally biologic
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No no that's you lose me on the word totally
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Okay so it's met muchly biological mostly biological I might I might meet you halfway
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Totally know
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Why does it have to be entirely why do we have to go out like all the way
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Because if you're not going to go
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	All the way
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Here's the things that
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You're Siri
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:41,088	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm just going to jump in here because this part of the conversation got a little dance
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And a long butt
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Sapolsky basic
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,976	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Point was that you just have to look at
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The story of Ark
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Scientific discoveries
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:53,376	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	500 years ago we would have said the epileptic seizure was
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Like bad
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Demonic possession
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:57,984	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nanana we learned that biologic
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Up to the mid 1950
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:06,944	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If you're like adolescent child suddenly started having hallucinations and hearing voices me thought disorder
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And you would say you the mother of this child would say where did this disease come from
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:15,392	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the best of science at the time have an answer they would say
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:21,792	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You it's your fault it was cold schizophrenogenic mothering a mothering style that generated schizophrenia
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You cause your child schizophrenia
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And then in the mid-fifties the first antipsychotic drugs were developed in it emptied out the psychiatric
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:33,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Warts all over the country and everybody in the field said
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh my God
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:37,152	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's a biochemical disorder
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He says same thing happened with dyslexia we used to think it was just kids who are lazy oh that biological also
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:49,440	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	His contention is it this is just going to keep happening like a science progresses one by one all of the things that
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We think are under our control
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,792	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That we should control and that if we don't can be blamed for
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	One by one
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	All the things you can get chalked up two screw-ups in our biology
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:37:59,680	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Scrubs
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That we couldn't have control even feed wanted to
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:04,288	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So what you're going to have to do with that point
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:05,568	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:06,592	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Either say
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Starting tonight at midnight there will never be a new scientific finding pertinent to this area we've learned
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,528	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Everything there is
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Or you're going to say
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:19,648	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Free Will is just a biology that we haven't learned yet
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do you in your heart
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:35,008	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In your deep in the even the center of your alike in that
EDL	00:38:35,008	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do you really believe this
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,104	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do you really think second
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,896	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Not for a second
EDL	00:38:40,896	00:38:42,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And that's the whole thing
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This is like my like huge conundrum I have like zero belief in Free Will at this point
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,904	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yet at the same time I cannot for a second imagine
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:58,816	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What the world is supposed to look like with people believe in there is no free will I don't know how to imagine it
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:01,376	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I'm constantly this hypocrite
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	On this terrible hypocrite
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:09,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Because like I'll put on like my blue t-shirt instead of my gray t-shirt one morning
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:11,872	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And later in the day someone will say how well
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nice t-shirt and all say
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Thanks
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:22,112	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh my God the hypocrisy of it here I am taking credit for it
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And that circumstance I'm not able to stop and say well actually
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:27,744	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I have photoreceptor
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:29,280	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:33,888	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No because of this Gene variant that she invariance in my robe. Saint-jean
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:36,448	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So that I'm particularly good at noticing colors
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:39,008	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Combination since I can get the matching ad
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:46,176	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh I pick the fresh fruit here because my olfactory receptors allow me to like
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:48,736	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Be able to smell the pineapples that are fresh
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:55,136	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the luck of my socioeconomic status has me in like some like organic market and gives me that like ability to
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:01,024	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Did you do that while listening to like fake Peruvian music playing in the back at no you say
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When they say you really know how to
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,120	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pick good pineapple
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And I say
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:13,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Thanks
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:18,432	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	On the intellectual side I mean if you believe that every Behavior not just of Kevin
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:22,272	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Because what you're really saying is that the Deep lessons the Kevin story
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is it everyone is okay
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,368	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	All of us are Kevin all the time
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm at anything our worst and our best behavior
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,536	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That everything we choose
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To do
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,328	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,864	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In some sense
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,936	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Chosen for us the if you knew enough
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Stuff about
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Anyone
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You know what they're about to do next
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:49,408	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:50,688	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But I readily admit I flag in Plano
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Get on board with this
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,064	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	This
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:58,624	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At least we've done it in a few round
EDL	00:40:58,624	00:41:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What is we are able to do it when you look I'm teen and I don't want to be a futurist here but
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,840	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When you look 500 years ahead
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:13,984	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Let's say that the things keep progressing in the way that you imagine where we just keep etching liked or chipping away at the sides
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:15,008	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Definition of will
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Free will
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,312	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do we do in that point do we not hold anyone accountable for anything but we simply
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:23,968	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Prescribed
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:25,760	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Treatments
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What what is that world look like to you
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,160	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Treatments and or constraints
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,952	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You fix the things you fix
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:36,256	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And the ones that can't be fixed
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You can stream things of the damage can't be done
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But it's done in a
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And Away a car with
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Broken brakes is incredibly Danger
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,824	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Happy on the streets
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:52,895	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And if you can't fix the brakes you put the car in the garage
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:56,991	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You intervene
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But you don't invoke a concept of punishment of the car in there
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And if at that point you say oh my God that's so dehumanizing to be that mechanistic
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:13,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's a hell of a lot better than sermonizing people into having free will over stuff that they have no control over
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We've done it
EDL	00:42:15,423	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	People with treatment-resistant epilepsy
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You're not allowed to drive
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But you don't sit there and say
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	They deserve
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Not to be able to drive you don't get like moms of corydoras Yahoo peasants cheering
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When is the driver's licenses are burned
EDL	00:42:33,599	00:42:34,367	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	No
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's not their fault that they have this thing called a seizure
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:38,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nonetheless
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,279	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If it's uncontrollable they shouldn't be driving cars
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And we have a therapeutic intervention here that's completely outside the realm
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A blame
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Justice
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Deserve
EDL	00:42:50,495	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Anything like that
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:52,799	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Let's go back to camp
EDL	00:42:54,079	00:42:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	At the end of the story
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Pat ass
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Kevin what what what since he makes of his
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:00,991	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Punishment
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I assume a that you wouldn't have punished him
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Right
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:08,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You would recommend
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,743	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But you notice what Kevin says Kevin says
EDL	00:43:11,743	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Well I thought the judge was
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Was a good judge and was
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:17,375	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Fair Fare he called her Fair
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So isn't it
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:19,679	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Troubling to you
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That this person
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Somehow
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,799	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Was able to
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Somehow
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Feel blameworthy
EDL	00:43:28,383	00:43:29,151	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I guess
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:32,735	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But what this justice system is doing is it sort of saying
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You were bad
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Maybe I was
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:40,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I feel sorry I've got remorse
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	That's okay
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:43,487	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And now we give you
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:43,999	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Your freedom
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But there's been a
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It's been a conversation here
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	About

EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I wondering whether that's a healthy
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Healthy
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Mental healthy healthy or slightly healthy oil bad by saying thank you to your to your
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	What's your shirt of choice
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:12,671	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	So there is some human need here I don't know where you might quote by Logic or not but
EDL	00:44:13,439	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	There's something's justice system is addressing that you seem to be
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You seem to be taking out of the system
EDL	00:44:20,095	00:44:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Punishment is pleasurable
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:25,727	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	It feels good to do the righteous thing
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:30,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	And it feels good to do that in a punishing blaming way
EDL	00:44:30,591	00:44:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	If you're brought up culturally as most of us are too
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Have this notion of like
EDL	00:44:35,967	00:44:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Agency
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But I think I think of what Robert Mike
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Did this Robert krulwich Robert
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Might be
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I think Robert let me know if you if you if it correctly from wrong
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Is it it doesn't just feel good personally it's good for Society on some level
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Do we want to live in a society where the concept of justice has been tossed out and more in a mechanistic
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:44:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Take place
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Well how about taking it further
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Don't we need to have belief in a moralizing and punishing God because why else would people be nice to
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	To each other
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I don't need to take it all the way there
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In their wake God like that they rule over us I wanted to say
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Setup.
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You're right they work better as soon as you introduce the possibility of punishment in two economic games you
EDL	00:45:24,095	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You evolve cooperation
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:32,287	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You do cross-cultural studies and the more there's a belief in a punching Hell in a culture the more generous people
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Foreign economic games yes that stuff works
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yet
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Over and over
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	We've learned at least one domain
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:42,271	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Where we step outside of all of that
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The epilepsy example
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	When nobody thinks of it in terms of it being like
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,719	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Justice is being meted out when the driver's license
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Being taken away
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Yep 500 years ago
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:46:00,191	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Somebody who would have been just as smart and chest is introspective in chest is reflective and maybe even had like a
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Nice bleeding-heart liberal NPR tote bag
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:09,407	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Would have said if you're sad about this but that you told them to
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:15,807	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Oh my God I thought we were on fire and that person nonetheless would have said this is tragic and
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I feel so sorry for their family and all of that
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:20,415	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	But who told them to go sleep with Satan
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Waylon living this way is there anything in the Kevin patch
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Walter store is there anything anyone in there
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Who is being

EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:32,959	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Hurt by what you heard now
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Well
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:35,775	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	He's paying a price
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:38,335	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	His wife paid a price
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:39,871	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Shame
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:41,663	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Imprisonment
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,991	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The terrible price here
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	For what was simply
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The biological problem
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:53,951	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Still very hard to imagine
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,231	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	A world in which
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You don't get pissed off at people who do like
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:04,703	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Crummy thing and where you don't feel vaguely pleased when somebody says well nice t-shirt so what you just said is that
EDL	00:47:07,007	00:47:09,567	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The feelings that you have about
EDL	00:47:09,567	00:47:10,591	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The story of the
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Lost to her of her husband
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I love
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Shame of being put away for awhile
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,015	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	You think that
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,319	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Later on when the
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,599	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Deeply
EDL	00:47:22,367	00:47:26,463	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	Biological explanation for this gets fully revealed
EDL	00:47:27,487	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	In a hundred years say people will be able to listen to
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	The story we just heard
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:32,607	| radiolab_podcast17revisitingfaultline |	I'm think
