EDL	00:01:24,458	00:01:24,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	Exactly.
EDL	00:01:24,708	00:01:26,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	Because a while back, our reporter
EDL	00:01:26,666	00:01:28,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	producer, Rachel Cusick,
EDL	00:01:28,125	00:01:30,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	she sat me down in the studio
EDL	00:01:30,458	00:01:31,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:01:31,541	00:01:33,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	to tell me a story about both how
EDL	00:01:33,416	00:01:35,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	beautiful we humans are,
EDL	00:01:35,666	00:01:36,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:36,458	00:01:38,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	but also just how
EDL	00:01:38,041	00:01:41,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	downright awful we can be.
EDL	00:01:41,458	00:01:42,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:42,208	00:01:44,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	And the tricky business of deciding
EDL	00:01:44,083	00:01:45,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	who should be held responsible
EDL	00:01:45,458	00:01:46,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:46,250	00:01:48,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	when that ugly part of us shows.
EDL	00:01:48,583	00:01:49,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:01:49,750	00:01:51,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Let's hit it.
EDL	00:01:51,083	00:01:51,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:01:51,833	00:01:53,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- So okay, so we are gonna
EDL	00:01:53,000	00:01:55,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	start on a stoop in Harlem.
EDL	00:01:55,125	00:01:58,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Over in West Harlem in what, 2016?
EDL	00:01:58,041	00:02:00,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:00,583	00:02:01,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	Yeah, 2016.
EDL	00:02:01,000	00:02:01,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:01,458	00:02:03,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Matthew Herrick.
EDL	00:02:03,083	00:02:04,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Wait, do you go by Matt or Matthew?
EDL	00:02:04,250	00:02:04,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:04,583	00:02:06,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Most people call me Matthew.
EDL	00:02:06,000	00:02:06,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Cool.
EDL	00:02:06,291	00:02:08,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	At the time, Matthew had recently moved
EDL	00:02:08,125	00:02:10,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	from LA to New York City.
EDL	00:02:10,166	00:02:11,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	- It was definitely, you know,
EDL	00:02:11,666	00:02:12,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:12,083	00:02:14,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	a punch to the face, if you will.
EDL	00:02:14,041	00:02:15,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Trading palm trees and sunshine
EDL	00:02:15,791	00:02:18,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	for a smelly city stoop.
EDL	00:02:18,000	00:02:18,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah.
EDL	00:02:18,625	00:02:18,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Anyway.
EDL	00:02:18,958	00:02:19,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:02:19,875	00:02:22,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I think it was around October, mid-October.
EDL	00:02:22,041	00:02:22,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:22,625	00:02:23,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	I was sitting on my stairs,
EDL	00:02:23,708	00:02:25,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	which is like in the front of my building.
EDL	00:02:25,916	00:02:27,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	What's this guy look like, do we know?
EDL	00:02:27,125	00:02:27,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:27,750	00:02:31,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	Like tall, muscular, salt and pepper hair nowadays.
EDL	00:02:31,458	00:02:33,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	I think probably just pepper back in the day.
EDL	00:02:33,541	00:02:34,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And I was having a cigarette,
EDL	00:02:34,833	00:02:38,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	and a gentleman walked up and stopped
EDL	00:02:38,250	00:02:39,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	and just stood in front of me.
EDL	00:02:39,791	00:02:40,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	And you know, it's New York,
EDL	00:02:40,666	00:02:42,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	so you have a lot of fucking weirdos.
EDL	00:02:42,375	00:02:45,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	So I figured it was just some weirdo being weird.
EDL	00:02:45,708	00:02:47,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Like whatever, I'm just gonna ignore them.
EDL	00:02:47,458	00:02:49,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, like it's all good.
EDL	00:02:49,208	00:02:51,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	So I'm like kind of avoiding eye contact,
EDL	00:02:51,166	00:02:52,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	but then I realized that
EDL	00:02:52,000	00:02:52,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	they're standing there for,
EDL	00:02:52,833	00:02:53,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:53,208	00:02:54,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	you know, an extended period of time.
EDL	00:02:54,916	00:02:56,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	So I like looked up.
EDL	00:02:56,333	00:02:57,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	And it's someone that he doesn't know,
EDL	00:02:57,875	00:02:58,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:58,208	00:03:01,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	someone that he doesn't recognize, but this guy.
EDL	00:03:01,541	00:03:01,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:03:01,875	00:03:02,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- He went, "Hey, Matt."
EDL	00:03:02,833	00:03:04,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:03:04,583	00:03:08,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I was like, "Hi," like how the hell do you know my name?
EDL	00:03:08,833	00:03:10,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:03:10,500	00:03:14,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	And he says, "It's so-and-so, we were talking on Grindr."
EDL	00:03:14,541	00:03:17,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Grindr, dating app used primarily by gay men.
EDL	00:03:17,458	00:03:17,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:17,916	00:03:21,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	And so this stranger tilts his phone towards Matthew,
EDL	00:03:21,500	00:03:22,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	and he's like, "Look."
EDL	00:03:22,750	00:03:26,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And it's a profile on the app with, you know,
EDL	00:03:26,125	00:03:27,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	a picture of me.
EDL	00:03:27,000	00:03:28,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:03:28,583	00:03:30,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I was like, "That's not possible."
EDL	00:03:30,583	00:03:32,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Like that is a photo of me.
EDL	00:03:32,916	00:03:33,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:33,416	00:03:34,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	- But that's not me.
EDL	00:03:34,750	00:03:37,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- That is not a profile that I made.
EDL	00:03:37,250	00:03:39,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	I am not on Grindr, you know?
EDL	00:03:39,666	00:03:40,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:03:40,333	00:03:41,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	So he looks up at this guy.
EDL	00:03:41,833	00:03:42,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Like, "I don't know
EDL	00:03:42,375	00:03:43,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	how to explain this.
EDL	00:03:43,333	00:03:44,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	I don't know who you're talking to.
EDL	00:03:44,666	00:03:46,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	I'm very confused right now.
EDL	00:03:46,000	00:03:46,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	Like you need to leave."
EDL	00:03:46,833	00:03:47,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:03:47,416	00:03:49,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I got up and I went inside.
EDL	00:03:49,208	00:03:49,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:03:49,791	00:03:50,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I remember I looked
EDL	00:03:50,458	00:03:51,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	at my roommate, Michael,
EDL	00:03:51,458	00:03:55,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	and I was like, "Someone just showed up looking for me from Grindr."
EDL	00:03:55,458	00:03:56,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	Like, how weird is that?
EDL	00:03:56,750	00:03:57,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:57,291	00:03:59,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, little did I know.
EDL	00:03:59,208	00:04:00,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:04:00,166	00:04:00,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	(laughing)
EDL	00:04:00,208	00:04:03,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Because after that, another guy came, and then another.
EDL	00:04:03,791	00:04:04,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:04,125	00:04:05,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	- People started showing up.
EDL	00:04:05,750	00:04:08,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	- It just keeps happening.
EDL	00:04:08,291	00:04:09,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Sometimes I would be home,
EDL	00:04:09,375	00:04:10,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	or sometimes I'd be leaving the building
EDL	00:04:10,916	00:04:12,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	and there'd be people outside.
EDL	00:04:12,166	00:04:13,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Each time, a different man.
EDL	00:04:13,791	00:04:15,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	- You know, one or two a week.
EDL	00:04:15,166	00:04:17,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- All saying the same thing.
EDL	00:04:17,083	00:04:17,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:04:17,625	00:04:20,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	Like, we were talking on Grindr, let's have sex.
EDL	00:04:20,333	00:04:21,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:04:21,541	00:04:23,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	So he reports the profile to Grindr,
EDL	00:04:23,500	00:04:24,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	got the like automatic reply.
EDL	00:04:24,958	00:04:25,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:25,375	00:04:26,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	"We'll get back to you soon,"
EDL	00:04:26,416	00:04:27,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	or whatever the hell it said.
EDL	00:04:27,541	00:04:30,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	- But he doesn't actually hear back from anyone at the company.
EDL	00:04:30,166	00:04:30,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:04:30,916	00:04:31,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	And meanwhile--
EDL	00:04:31,541	00:04:32,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:04:32,000	00:04:35,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- People were showing up to my home in large volumes.
EDL	00:04:35,458	00:04:36,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:04:36,333	00:04:38,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	And like, "I'm living my life, leave me alone.
EDL	00:04:38,541	00:04:39,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	Can I get a break?"
EDL	00:04:39,208	00:04:40,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And finally, one night,
EDL	00:04:40,875	00:04:41,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:04:41,208	00:04:43,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	he's annoyed, he's fed up.
EDL	00:04:43,000	00:04:45,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I stood up and said, "Fuck this."
EDL	00:04:45,458	00:04:49,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And he decides he is going to get to the bottom of this.
EDL	00:04:49,000	00:04:49,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:49,416	00:04:51,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, so I downloaded Grindr.
EDL	00:04:51,375	00:04:52,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- He makes a profile.
EDL	00:04:52,625	00:04:53,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Without a photo.
EDL	00:04:53,291	00:04:53,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:04:53,750	00:04:54,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	And then logs on.
EDL	00:04:54,958	00:04:55,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:55,375	00:04:58,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And I saw the fake profile of myself,
EDL	00:04:58,208	00:04:59,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	very close proximity.
EDL	00:04:59,166	00:05:00,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:05:00,458	00:05:02,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Grindr actually has this map feature
EDL	00:05:02,291	00:05:04,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	where you can see where other people are
EDL	00:05:04,291	00:05:05,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	who are on Grindr.
EDL	00:05:05,458	00:05:06,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:05:06,250	00:05:09,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	And this person who had Matthew's name
EDL	00:05:09,458	00:05:09,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:09,833	00:05:12,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	and his photo is like right there.
EDL	00:05:12,708	00:05:14,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:05:14,666	00:05:15,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	Right outside his apartment.
EDL	00:05:15,791	00:05:17,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:05:17,625	00:05:20,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- So I walked outside
EDL	00:05:20,875	00:05:21,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:05:21,875	00:05:23,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	and I remember looking down the street
EDL	00:05:23,083	00:05:24,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:24,708	00:05:25,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	and he took off running.
EDL	00:05:25,541	00:05:28,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.8 secs ]
EDL	00:05:28,291	00:05:29,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I went and chased after him.
EDL	00:05:29,708	00:05:30,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:30,208	00:05:31,442	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And while he's running, 
EDL	00:05:31,442	00:05:33,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	Matthew is looking at the Grindr app,
EDL	00:05:33,375	00:05:34,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	scanning for the fake him.
EDL	00:05:34,791	00:05:35,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Because you can refresh it
EDL	00:05:35,791	00:05:37,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	and it'll tell you how far that person is away.
EDL	00:05:37,750	00:05:38,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And this fake Matthew,
EDL	00:05:38,916	00:05:40,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	he was like 20 feet away.
EDL	00:05:40,416	00:05:42,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	- So I'm walking along Morningside Park,
EDL	00:05:42,416	00:05:43,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	refreshed the app.
EDL	00:05:43,166	00:05:44,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Then 15.
EDL	00:05:44,041	00:05:44,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:44,416	00:05:45,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I was walking and I was walking.
EDL	00:05:45,500	00:05:46,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Then 10.
EDL	00:05:46,250	00:05:46,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:46,875	00:05:47,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And I remember I
EDL	00:05:47,625	00:05:49,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	looked down and I was like,
EDL	00:05:49,416	00:05:50,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	"He's five feet away.
EDL	00:05:50,750	00:05:51,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	How is he five feet away?"
EDL	00:05:51,958	00:05:54,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:05:54,250	00:05:55,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I stood on the park bench
EDL	00:05:55,833	00:05:57,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:57,291	00:05:58,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	and I looked over the fence
EDL	00:05:58,458	00:05:59,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:05:59,208	00:06:00,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	and laying face down
EDL	00:06:00,208	00:06:02,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	in the bushes was JC.
EDL	00:06:02,750	00:06:04,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:06:04,083	00:06:05,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- His ex, JC.
EDL	00:06:05,916	00:06:06,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:06,333	00:06:08,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And I screamed, "I fucking caught you.
EDL	00:06:08,875	00:06:09,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	I caught you.
EDL	00:06:09,791	00:06:10,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	I knew it was you."
EDL	00:06:10,916	00:06:12,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- JC started yelling back at him.
EDL	00:06:12,958	00:06:14,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	Matthew ran away.
EDL	00:06:14,083	00:06:15,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	JC chased him.
EDL	00:06:15,375	00:06:16,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	The cops got called.
EDL	00:06:16,333	00:06:16,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:16,708	00:06:17,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	It was a mess.
EDL	00:06:17,625	00:06:18,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:18,041	00:06:18,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Ugh.
EDL	00:06:18,500	00:06:19,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:06:19,541	00:06:24,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	So an ex lover made a fake profile
EDL	00:06:24,166	00:06:25,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:06:25,166	00:06:28,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	for the purpose of terrorizing him?
EDL	00:06:28,583	00:06:30,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, Matthew and this
EDL	00:06:30,083	00:06:31,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	guy JC had started dating
EDL	00:06:31,916	00:06:32,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	not long after
EDL	00:06:32,708	00:06:34,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	Matthew arrived in the city.
EDL	00:06:34,250	00:06:35,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And we dated for, I
EDL	00:06:35,625	00:06:36,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	wanna say eight to 10 months.
EDL	00:06:36,875	00:06:40,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Matthew saw some little red flags and ended things.
EDL	00:06:40,333	00:06:42,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	And that's when these people started coming.
EDL	00:06:42,583	00:06:43,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:06:43,375	00:06:45,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	I think once Matthew broke up with him,
EDL	00:06:45,500	00:06:47,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	he was like, "If you don't wanna date me,
EDL	00:06:47,083	00:06:48,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	then like screw you.
EDL	00:06:48,250	00:06:49,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	I'll make your life a living hell."
EDL	00:06:49,750	00:06:50,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:06:50,083	00:06:52,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	Anyhow, once he knew it was JC.
EDL	00:06:52,500	00:06:53,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:06:53,000	00:06:55,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I ended up getting an order of protection against him.
EDL	00:06:55,583	00:06:59,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And so JC couldn't go anywhere near him in real life.
EDL	00:06:59,250	00:06:59,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:06:59,708	00:07:02,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	But an order of protection doesn't really apply
EDL	00:07:02,500	00:07:05,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	when JC's sending other people to his door.
EDL	00:07:05,416	00:07:07,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- There was no ramifications for what he was doing.
EDL	00:07:07,958	00:07:11,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	- There wasn't anything the courts or the cops could do about it.
EDL	00:07:11,333	00:07:11,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:11,833	00:07:14,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	So Matthew contacts Grindr again and is like,
EDL	00:07:14,166	00:07:14,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	"This is the guy.
EDL	00:07:14,875	00:07:15,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:15,333	00:07:16,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	Shut him down, please."
EDL	00:07:16,541	00:07:17,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:07:17,500	00:07:20,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	But still nothing, no acknowledgement.
EDL	00:07:20,416	00:07:20,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:20,875	00:07:23,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	We reached out to Grindr for comment, didn't hear back.
EDL	00:07:23,083	00:07:23,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:07:23,625	00:07:26,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	Anyhow, with Grindr doing nothing,
EDL	00:07:26,375	00:07:27,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:07:27,250	00:07:28,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	JC went on the offensive.
EDL	00:07:28,875	00:07:29,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:07:29,625	00:07:32,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	He actually made multiple fake Matthew profiles.
EDL	00:07:32,125	00:07:34,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- There were two to three existing on the platform.
EDL	00:07:34,000	00:07:34,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:34,375	00:07:38,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	And that's when the gay zombies started coming from me.
EDL	00:07:38,041	00:07:38,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:07:38,375	00:07:39,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Do you call them gay zombies?
EDL	00:07:39,750	00:07:40,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:07:40,083	00:07:41,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, it's cause it's like, everyone's like mad.
EDL	00:07:41,833	00:07:42,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:07:42,916	00:07:45,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Just like must get sex now.
EDL	00:07:45,333	00:07:45,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:45,750	00:07:46,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah.
EDL	00:07:46,375	00:07:47,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:07:47,458	00:07:50,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I would leave at six o'clock in the morning to walk my dog.
EDL	00:07:50,875	00:07:52,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	There would be somebody outside waiting for me.
EDL	00:07:52,750	00:07:54,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	I would come home at night,
EDL	00:07:54,000	00:07:55,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	11, 30, 12 o'clock at night.
EDL	00:07:55,500	00:07:57,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	There'd be somebody waiting for me.
EDL	00:07:57,208	00:07:58,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	Literally every single day of my life.
EDL	00:07:58,916	00:07:59,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:07:59,541	00:08:01,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And it wasn't just a lot of awkward,
EDL	00:08:01,541	00:08:02,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	but harmless encounters
EDL	00:08:02,791	00:08:04,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	because these profiles.
EDL	00:08:04,458	00:08:04,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:08:04,875	00:08:06,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Said I was looking for rape fantasies.
EDL	00:08:06,541	00:08:07,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:08:07,083	00:08:10,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Matthew would try to explain the situation to people calmly.
EDL	00:08:10,166	00:08:10,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:08:10,708	00:08:11,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	But then.
EDL	00:08:11,291	00:08:14,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- The profiles were telling these individuals
EDL	00:08:14,250	00:08:15,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	it was part of my turn on.
EDL	00:08:15,916	00:08:16,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:08:16,250	00:08:19,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	So to stay and then approach me again.
EDL	00:08:19,208	00:08:21,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Ugh, just diabolical.
EDL	00:08:21,250	00:08:24,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, and so again, he tries reporting the profiles.
EDL	00:08:24,041	00:08:24,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:08:24,458	00:08:26,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I had friends reporting profiles,
EDL	00:08:26,000	00:08:27,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	family reporting profiles,
EDL	00:08:27,416	00:08:29,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	sending emails to the company.
EDL	00:08:29,208	00:08:30,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Again, nothing.
EDL	00:08:30,500	00:08:32,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I was slammed against the wall.
EDL	00:08:32,500	00:08:33,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Oh my gosh.
EDL	00:08:33,208	00:08:34,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	- There was someone who broke into my building
EDL	00:08:34,750	00:08:36,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	and physically assaulted my roommate.
EDL	00:08:36,750	00:08:37,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	while trying to get to me.
EDL	00:08:37,916	00:08:39,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- He goes to the cops.
EDL	00:08:39,208	00:08:40,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- File a police report
EDL	00:08:40,125	00:08:41,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	and they turn me away.
EDL	00:08:41,166	00:08:41,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:08:41,500	00:08:42,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	They were like, we don't understand.
EDL	00:08:42,583	00:08:43,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:08:43,000	00:08:44,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	I don't think anybody really could grasp
EDL	00:08:44,708	00:08:46,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	what I was actually talking about.
EDL	00:08:46,166	00:08:46,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:08:46,500	00:08:49,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- JC started making profiles that promised people crystal meth
EDL	00:08:49,958	00:08:51,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	and said they should show up at the restaurant
EDL	00:08:51,916	00:08:53,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	where Matthew worked.
EDL	00:08:53,375	00:08:56,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I was taking an order at a fucking table.
EDL	00:08:56,458	00:08:59,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I remember this guy is tapping on my shoulder,
EDL	00:08:59,041	00:09:01,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	saying my name, high out of his mind.
EDL	00:09:01,208	00:09:01,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:01,666	00:09:03,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I'm looking at the people that are sitting down
EDL	00:09:03,500	00:09:04,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	and they're looking back up at me
EDL	00:09:04,875	00:09:05,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:05,333	00:09:07,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	and they're like, what is going on?
EDL	00:09:07,208	00:09:09,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	And my eyes are just welling up with tears.
EDL	00:09:09,291	00:09:10,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:09:10,041	00:09:11,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	Cause I'm like, oh my God.
EDL	00:09:11,375	00:09:13,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I'm like, how do you want your burger cooked?
EDL	00:09:13,083	00:09:13,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:13,416	00:09:14,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	You know what I mean?
EDL	00:09:14,333	00:09:15,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:15,750	00:09:18,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And this went on for months.
EDL	00:09:18,250	00:09:19,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:09:19,250	00:09:19,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Jesus.

EDL	00:09:21,166	00:09:23,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Did you hate hearing your name at that point in your life?
EDL	00:09:23,958	00:09:24,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Oh, I hated it.
EDL	00:09:24,875	00:09:26,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	I hated everything about existing.
EDL	00:09:26,291	00:09:26,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:26,750	00:09:27,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	I hated it all.
EDL	00:09:27,708	00:09:29,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	Like I remember sitting there saying to myself,
EDL	00:09:29,583	00:09:30,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:30,125	00:09:32,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	like I either want to fucking blow my brains out
EDL	00:09:32,333	00:09:33,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	or throw myself off a building.
EDL	00:09:33,791	00:09:36,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:36,083	00:09:39,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And then one day
EDL	00:09:39,208	00:09:41,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	Matthew's talking to his lawyer.
EDL	00:09:41,458	00:09:43,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- My family court lawyer,
EDL	00:09:43,125	00:09:45,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	she said, hey, there's this woman named Carrie Goldberg.
EDL	00:09:45,625	00:09:47,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:09:47,333	00:09:48,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	She might be able to help you.
EDL	00:09:48,958	00:09:50,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	And at that time I was
EDL	00:09:50,000	00:09:53,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	so just beat to a pulp.
EDL	00:09:53,250	00:09:54,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	I just heard the word help.
EDL	00:09:54,666	00:09:55,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I was like, yeah.
EDL	00:09:55,583	00:09:56,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:56,083	00:09:58,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- So he takes the train to downtown Brooklyn.
EDL	00:09:58,125	00:09:58,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:58,458	00:09:59,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I sat in her office
EDL	00:09:59,375	00:10:01,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	and she told me a little bit about herself.
EDL	00:10:01,291	00:10:02,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I mean, as background,
EDL	00:10:02,708	00:10:04,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	I started this law firm
EDL	00:10:04,250	00:10:04,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:10:04,916	00:10:09,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	after I had been the target of a malicious

EDL	00:10:09,958	00:10:12,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	and creative and relentless ex.
EDL	00:10:12,833	00:10:14,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- attorney, Carrie Goldberg.
EDL	00:10:14,541	00:10:17,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- One of the most malicious things that my ex was doing
EDL	00:10:17,458	00:10:20,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	was blackmailing me with naked pictures
EDL	00:10:20,333	00:10:24,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	and videos that he had, contacting everybody in my life.
EDL	00:10:24,375	00:10:27,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	He's making false IRS reports against my family.
EDL	00:10:27,958	00:10:30,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Now at that time, Carrie was already a lawyer herself,
EDL	00:10:30,875	00:10:31,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:10:31,208	00:10:33,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	but she really only did family law stuff,
EDL	00:10:33,666	00:10:35,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	wills, guardianships, things like that.
EDL	00:10:35,916	00:10:36,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:36,500	00:10:39,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I had so much difficulty during that process
EDL	00:10:39,000	00:10:39,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:10:39,750	00:10:42,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	finding a lawyer who knew what to do
EDL	00:10:42,625	00:10:42,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:10:42,958	00:10:44,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	and like was at the intersection
EDL	00:10:44,250	00:10:47,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	of intimate partner violence and internet law
EDL	00:10:47,750	00:10:49,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	and first amendment and knew how to get
EDL	00:10:49,833	00:10:50,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	an order of protection.
EDL	00:10:50,583	00:10:51,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:10:51,291	00:10:53,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I was really desperate.
EDL	00:10:53,000	00:10:55,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	And so after this all ended,
EDL	00:10:55,000	00:10:56,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	I became the lawyer I needed.
EDL	00:10:56,666	00:10:57,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:10:57,041	00:10:59,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- A lawyer for people like Matthew.
EDL	00:10:59,208	00:11:04,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- So she told me her story and I told her mine.
EDL	00:11:04,041	00:11:05,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	And before I could finish, she said,
EDL	00:11:05,333	00:11:06,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	I would like to represent you.
EDL	00:11:06,666	00:11:07,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:07,125	00:11:10,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	I think we can slow this attack on you.
EDL	00:11:10,625	00:11:12,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And the way to do that, Carrie said,
EDL	00:11:12,833	00:11:15,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	was to go after Grindr, take him to court
EDL	00:11:15,291	00:11:16,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	and argue that this guy
EDL	00:11:16,500	00:11:19,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	JC used Grindr essentially
EDL	00:11:19,125	00:11:21,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	as a weapon that Grindr knew all about it
EDL	00:11:21,833	00:11:24,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	and did absolutely nothing to stop it.
EDL	00:11:24,791	00:11:25,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

EDL	00:11:25,583	00:11:26,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	And so, day of the hearing,
EDL	00:11:26,875	00:11:27,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:27,375	00:11:29,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	Carrie and her team file in,

EDL	00:11:29,791	00:11:30,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	sit down confidently

EDL	00:11:32,541	00:11:34,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	- We're pretty bad-ass litigators.
EDL	00:11:34,166	00:11:35,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:11:35,000	00:11:36,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And across the aisle is,
EDL	00:11:36,500	00:11:38,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	of course, Grindr's lawyers.
EDL	00:11:38,083	00:11:38,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:38,541	00:11:38,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:11:38,916	00:11:39,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:39,416	00:11:42,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And as the hearing begins, the Grindr guys, they stand up.
EDL	00:11:42,500	00:11:42,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:11:42,833	00:11:44,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I'm imagining they do that thing that men do

EDL	00:11:45,125	00:11:46,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	their tie tucked in like

EDL	00:11:49,750	00:11:52,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	Your honor, we don't have to do anything
EDL	00:11:52,958	00:11:53,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:11:53,750	00:11:56,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	because of section 230.
EDL	00:11:56,666	00:11:59,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:11:59,166	00:12:00,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Section 230.
EDL	00:12:00,958	00:12:01,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:12:01,583	00:12:04,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, and the judge is like, you're right.
EDL	00:12:04,208	00:12:05,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:12:05,041	00:12:06,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	We don't have to go any further.
EDL	00:12:06,500	00:12:07,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:12:07,625	00:12:08,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	That's the end of this.

EDL	00:12:15,041	00:12:15,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	It was over.

EDL	00:12:17,125	00:12:19,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	And I said, what the fuck is section 230?
EDL	00:12:19,083	00:12:19,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:12:19,958	00:12:21,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	I didn't even understand what that meant.
EDL	00:12:21,416	00:12:24,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 3.3 secs ]

EDL	00:12:24,708	00:12:26,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	Okay, so let's start there.

EDL	00:12:36,000	00:12:40,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Attorney and justice correspondent at the Nation Magazine, L.A. Mistall.

EDL	00:12:43,333	00:12:46,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	Now, it's worth pointing out that most of the rest
EDL	00:12:46,750	00:12:48,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	of the law is no longer good law.
EDL	00:12:48,625	00:12:49,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:12:49,291	00:12:53,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	It's been amended, it's been shaped, it's been overcome

EDL	00:12:54,750	00:12:57,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	better laws that take into account

EDL	00:12:58,750	00:12:59,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:59,125	00:13:01,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	But section 230 is the

EDL	00:13:03,416	00:13:06,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And 230, it does one simple thing.

EDL	00:13:06,833	00:13:10,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	- It relieves internet companies of liability

EDL	00:13:14,291	00:13:17,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Meaning, he says, not only in Matthew's case,
EDL	00:13:17,208	00:13:20,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	but in others like it, when someone lies about someone else
EDL	00:13:20,916	00:13:22,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	or threatens them or even
EDL	00:13:22,791	00:13:24,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	tries to do them some kind

EDL	00:13:28,958	00:13:30,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	they get off scot-free.

EDL	00:13:31,375	00:13:31,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:13:31,833	00:13:36,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	Section 230 is fundamentally at core a liability shield.
EDL	00:13:36,625	00:13:39,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- A shield that no other industry gets
EDL	00:13:39,625	00:13:40,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:13:40,083	00:13:41,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	except the tech industry.

EDL	00:13:42,666	00:13:44,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	In short, section 230.

EDL	00:18:54,625	00:18:55,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Go fuck yourself. - No, you go fuck yourself.

EDL	00:18:56,875	00:18:57,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Goodbye.

EDL	00:19:03,375	00:19:05,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Were brought in to turn down the temperature
EDL	00:19:05,708	00:19:08,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	by removing posts that went too far.
EDL	00:19:08,000	00:19:14,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	So, you know, I just took down swear words, derogatory words, racial slurs, et cetera.
EDL	00:19:14,000	00:19:15,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And it's just you there.
EDL	00:19:15,208	00:19:16,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	You're all by yourself.
EDL	00:19:16,375	00:19:17,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- That's correct.
EDL	00:19:17,083	00:19:18,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	I was the only one who had the software,
EDL	00:19:18,750	00:19:21,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	the moderating software, and there were,

EDL	00:19:24,708	00:19:26,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	on the Money Talk bulletin board.

EDL	00:19:31,125	00:19:31,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	(laughing)
EDL	00:19:31,166	00:19:34,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And so Chuck, he managed to create this little neighborhood
EDL	00:19:34,958	00:19:35,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	(phone ringing)
EDL	00:19:35,583	00:19:36,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]

EDL	00:19:38,708	00:19:41,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	but where he could also be a kindly curator.
EDL	00:19:41,583	00:19:42,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:19:42,291	00:19:44,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	Make sure that no one got out of line.
EDL	00:19:44,166	00:19:45,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:45,125	00:19:45,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	Until--
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Well, one evening I was at my house,
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	took my poodle out the front door for a walk.
EDL	00:19:49,625	00:19:50,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- sloppy, little fella.
EDL	00:19:50,625	00:19:52,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	- He was a miniature French poodle, Beau,
EDL	00:19:52,708	00:19:53,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:19:53,041	00:19:56,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	and we walked down the street about 40 paces.
EDL	00:19:56,083	00:19:56,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Beau does his business,
EDL	00:19:56,916	00:19:57,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:19:57,250	00:19:58,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	Chuck stretches his legs.
EDL	00:19:58,583	00:20:02,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And a man literally jumps out of the bushes.
EDL	00:20:02,041	00:20:02,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:02,541	00:20:03,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Oh my God.
EDL	00:20:03,500	00:20:04,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- It was like from the spy movies.
EDL	00:20:04,916	00:20:05,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:20:05,916	00:20:07,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	I didn't know what this guy was doing.
EDL	00:20:07,333	00:20:08,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:20:08,708	00:20:11,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And standing there under a street light.
EDL	00:20:11,833	00:20:12,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:12,416	00:20:14,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	- He says like, Mr. Epstein, I said yes.
EDL	00:20:14,458	00:20:14,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:20:14,875	00:20:16,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	And he hands me a piece of paper.
EDL	00:20:16,291	00:20:17,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:20:17,250	00:20:21,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	It was an envelope, and he says, thank you, have a nice night.
EDL	00:20:21,625	00:20:22,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:20:22,291	00:20:23,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I thought you were gonna say, he said,
EDL	00:20:23,666	00:20:24,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:24,291	00:20:25,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	I'm here to have sex with you.
EDL	00:20:25,625	00:20:26,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah. (laughing)
EDL	00:20:26,750	00:20:27,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:20:27,541	00:20:29,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	I am a gay zombie of yesteryear.
EDL	00:20:29,500	00:20:30,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:20:30,666	00:20:30,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	(laughing)
EDL	00:20:30,833	00:20:31,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:20:31,208	00:20:32,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	This is where it all started.
EDL	00:20:32,541	00:20:33,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EDL	00:20:33,125	00:20:33,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:33,750	00:20:36,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	Anyhow, so Chuck turns around, walks home quickly.
EDL	00:20:36,583	00:20:37,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:37,041	00:20:39,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	- I went back in the house and opened the envelope.
EDL	00:20:39,916	00:20:42,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- The first thing that he sees on this piece of paper,
EDL	00:20:42,500	00:20:43,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	it says-
EDL	00:20:43,125	00:20:45,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Stratton Oakmont versus Prodigy,
EDL	00:20:45,125	00:20:46,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	and big letters at the very top.
EDL	00:20:46,458	00:20:46,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:46,958	00:20:48,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	He said, what the hell is this?
EDL	00:20:48,333	00:20:48,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:48,958	00:20:50,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Turns out that Stratton Oakmont
EDL	00:20:50,958	00:20:52,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	was suing Chuck's employer, Prodigy,
EDL	00:20:52,958	00:20:53,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:20:53,583	00:20:56,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	claiming that someone had used Chuck's bulletin board
EDL	00:20:56,958	00:20:58,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	to smear their company,
EDL	00:20:58,291	00:20:58,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:58,833	00:21:00,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	saying that their president-

EDL	00:21:00,708	00:21:04,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Was a thief involved in some scams,
EDL	00:21:04,000	00:21:04,458	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:04,458	00:21:06,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	and Stratton Oakmont was a criminal organization,
EDL	00:21:06,625	00:21:07,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:07,375	00:21:10,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	basically attacked the reputation and the financial acumen
EDL	00:21:10,625	00:21:11,375	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:11,375	00:21:14,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	and the honesty and the ethics of Stratton Oakmont.
EDL	00:21:14,333	00:21:16,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And that these posts constituted defamation.
EDL	00:21:16,708	00:21:18,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	- In this $100 billion lawsuit.
EDL	00:21:18,416	00:21:19,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:21:19,041	00:21:21,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Now, as would be discovered years later,
EDL	00:21:21,541	00:21:23,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	these posts were not defamatory.
EDL	00:21:23,541	00:21:24,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:24,041	00:21:25,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	In fact, Stratton Oakmont and their president
EDL	00:21:25,583	00:21:28,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	were doing so many illegal things
EDL	00:21:28,083	00:21:30,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	that they would one day inspire Leonardo DiCaprio.
EDL	00:21:30,958	00:21:33,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Was all this legal?
EDL	00:21:33,208	00:21:33,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:33,750	00:21:34,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	Absolutely not.
EDL	00:21:34,500	00:21:35,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:21:35,208	00:21:36,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	- In the film, "The Wolf of Wall Street."
EDL	00:21:36,791	00:21:37,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:21:37,125	00:21:38,666	| The Internet Dilemma |	- We don't work for you, man.
EDL	00:21:38,666	00:21:40,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, my money taped to your boobs.
EDL	00:21:40,041	00:21:41,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	Technically, you do work for me.
EDL	00:21:41,166	00:21:42,750	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:21:42,750	00:21:46,541	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Yeah, Jonah Hill's character was actually based
EDL	00:21:46,541	00:21:48,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	on the guy who cried defamation.
EDL	00:21:48,208	00:21:48,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:21:48,833	00:21:52,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	But at the time of the suit, nobody knew anything about that.
EDL	00:21:52,125	00:21:52,791	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:21:52,791	00:21:53,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	And so-
EDL	00:21:53,500	00:21:55,000	| The Internet Dilemma |	- The lawsuit was about a-
EDL	00:21:55,000	00:21:55,708	| The Internet Dilemma |	It went over a-
EDL	00:21:55,708	00:21:57,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	- When the thing went to trial,
EDL	00:21:57,500	00:21:57,916	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:21:57,916	00:22:00,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	they argued that because
EDL	00:22:00,250	00:22:03,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	Prodigy employed people like Chuck, moderators who left posts up
EDL	00:22:03,625	00:22:04,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	and took posts down,
EDL	00:22:04,625	00:22:05,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:22:05,166	00:22:09,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	that they were responsible for every defamatory post they left up.
EDL	00:22:09,416	00:22:09,958	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:22:09,958	00:22:11,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	And this judge agreed.
EDL	00:22:11,625	00:22:13,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	- The judge ruled that Prodigy was responsible.
EDL	00:22:13,291	00:22:14,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:22:14,166	00:22:15,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	- The world of Prodigy.

EDL	00:22:20,209	00:22:23,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Now, the irony here is that right around this time,
EDL	00:22:23,416	00:22:23,875	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:22:23,875	00:22:25,333	| The Internet Dilemma |	there was another company.

EDL	00:22:28,250	00:22:29,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	- CompuServe.
EDL	00:22:29,125	00:22:33,250	| The Internet Dilemma |	- And CompuServe did not hold itself out to be a family-friendly bulletin board.
EDL	00:22:33,250	00:22:33,625	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:22:33,625	00:22:35,083	| The Internet Dilemma |	- They were just like Prodigy,
EDL	00:22:35,083	00:22:37,291	| The Internet Dilemma |	but they had no moderators, no chucks,
EDL	00:22:37,291	00:22:39,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	didn't take anything down, all the swear words,
EDL	00:22:39,416	00:22:42,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	defamation, racial slurs, all of it stayed there.
EDL	00:22:42,208	00:22:42,583	| The Internet Dilemma |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:22:42,583	00:22:44,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	And when they went to trial

EDL	00:22:44,500	00:22:48,208	| The Internet Dilemma |	in a very similar online defamation lawsuit, they won.

EDL	00:22:49,916	00:22:52,416	| The Internet Dilemma |	And so, weirdly in this situation,

EDL	00:22:52,791	00:22:56,500	| The Internet Dilemma |	if Prodigy had never set out to be a family-friendly place,
EDL	00:22:56,500	00:22:57,125	| The Internet Dilemma |	if they said,

EDL	00:22:59,125	00:23:01,833	| The Internet Dilemma |	they would not have lost this lawsuit.

EDL	00:23:03,500	00:23:08,166	| The Internet Dilemma |	- Well, that seems completely ass-backwards.

EDL	00:23:09,708	00:23:11,041	| The Internet Dilemma |	- What the law was saying
