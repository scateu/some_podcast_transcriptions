EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Radiolab WNYC
EDL	00:00:56,320	00:01:00,160	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Testing one two this the headphones safe
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Robert
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Radiolab
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How could I say
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because I let you go so give me another 20 minutes do I get to talk
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is there a little while back I had a rather live a little less conversation with these two guys first of all like who are you
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:19,360	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I'm Larry Bell and I'm Avenue Bell
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So you are related in your both in the plumbing business
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are we related
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes we are related but we are in the home inspection business
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah they're father and son at the family business we are the
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:31,136	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Principles
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,928	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Of accurate building inspectors
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Brooklyn New York and I've been in the construction in to see evidence I'm about 16 years old I'm 84
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Okay I'm not giving my age
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I wanted to talk to them because
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:49,568	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	As building inspectors date there's something they see over and over and over all the time
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That is actually a clue
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	In what turns out to be
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Deep mystery
EDL	00:01:58,528	00:01:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The way that you just what exactly
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Well let us say you have a yard in front of your house
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,928	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You're just back your
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Doesn't make in front and right in the middle of the yard is a tree and the tree happens to be
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Weeping willow just for example and not too far away from this tree underground there is a water pipe perfectly
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:22,848	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Good pipe connecting your house to the main city water line that's in the middle of the street the roots of this tree of course
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Can go anyway they want to go then go north south east west whatever
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What do you Bells have noticed that even if a tree is
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,272	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Hand
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,832	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	420 30 yards away from the water pipe
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	For some reason the tree roots creep
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	With uncanny regularity straight toward
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The water pipe the tree will wrap its roots around that pipe around around around
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Doing of spaghetti like almost and each one of those lines of spaghetti
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Squeezing
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Little bit each one announce announce announce announce announce and eventually over a p
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	People crack the pipe
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like a nutcracker
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You don't see this happening all the time coming up through the pipe into the house
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It's amazing that you happen to be the magnolia tree outside of our house got into the sewer pipes
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Reached its tentacles into our house
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What's the sewage pipe you just happens to a lot of people it's almost as if these plants it's almost as if they know
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Where are pipes
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I see what's happening
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are you bringing the plant parade again is that what is that what this is crush on you because
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The Roots under the ground all connected into a whole Hive you have problems with
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Everytime I close my eyes you're coming out of whatever Direction I do I do at the plant parade in a plant biologist
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I prayed she's done three experiments
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I think I tell you about what she has done you even you
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Will be provoked into thinking the plants can do stuff you didn't imagine dream they could
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I know I know you I know you
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Let's go to the first this is the
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plant and pipe Miss
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Hello hello hello you might
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Think that the plant sends out roots in every direction one of the richest
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Happens to bump into a water pipe and says to send a signal to come over here
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is the water
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But that scientist I mentioned my name is Monica research associate professor
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The University of Sydney out of the garden
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Into her lap
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah tasted in my life
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That restricted the route so they can only go to one of just two directions
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Order water pipe
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or away from the water pipe
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What kind of pot is it kind of shaped like the letter Y but upside down
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or the to the right
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Got the plants if they were truly dumb they goes if you hit a real friend
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But after 5 days
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She found that 80% of the time the plants went well maybe chose
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To head toward the dry pipe that has water in it so the question is
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,807	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Appliance that is quite far away from the actual pipe
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How does it know which way to turn and grow its roots
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So that he can find a warsat
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	My hypothesis is that what happens in
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Where can I can I have a few minutes you got somewhere to go
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You got somewhere to go
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No good
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	If she's going to do this experiment
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Most likely she's going to use cold water
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She's not going to use hot water
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Cuz you don't want
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Cook your plants
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You know
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And it's more expensive why waste hot water
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How do I establish is it a fact that you're okay but you want to confess
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The cold water pipe
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Causes
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Even
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Small amount of water to condense
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	On the pipe itself
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	On the outside but I kind of like a cold glass sitting on your desk
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And it's always a puddle at the bottom of the glass is not broken it's not a leaking water still in there so there is
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Some water outside of the pipe is condensation
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Right you what they're saying even if you totally seal the pipe so there's no leak
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The difference in temperature will create some condensation on the outside
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:24,767	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Little bit of moisture that the plant was somehow sense if you look at a root under a microscope
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What you see is
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:30,399	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Movie Fountains of feelers like hairs on your head
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Looking for water every one of them
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And all of a sudden one of them I found them and then all the other one direction
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Be sensitive hands he argues would probably be able to
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Keelback tiny different yes
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But Monica says absolutely not
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I purposely removed
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The chance for most degrading
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She made sure that the dirt
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Didn't get wet
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because she actually fast in the water pipe
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Do the outside of the Potter wasn't touching the dirt at always so the
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	This branching pot thing
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The part where the water pipe was over the pipe is on the outside of the pots right outside
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And the plants still went
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To the place where the pipe
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,151	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Was not even in the dark
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Estranged
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Let me get the vibration of the pie
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That's making it go toward it they would have to have no you got some kind of signal different
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Traveling through the soil
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Monica thought about that and designed a different experiment
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Again if you mentioned it depart my experiment to post with the fort
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Very different options for our plant
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	On one side
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Instead of a pipe with water she attaches
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,175	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	An MP3 player with a little speaker playing the recording
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Sound of water
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then on the other side Monica has another
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	MP3 player with speaker but this one
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plays
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Nothing
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So she's got her plants in the pot and we're going to now wait to see what happens remember that the roots of these
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	These plants can either go
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	One Direction towards the sound of water in the pipe
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The other direction to the sound of
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	On the fifth day they take a look and discover most
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Other routes of majority lyrics were hitting
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,503	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Chord the sound of water
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So they just went right for the
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	MP3
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Fake water not even the actual water just the sound of it just the sound
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,583	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Stetson
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I want to plant
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Ears
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Something
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like they don't have ears
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or a brain or anything like
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They couldn't hear like we hear
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Well
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Baby
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They definitely don't have a brain
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No questionnaire
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They do have root hairs
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:09:01,439	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	This is Jennifer Frazier vlogger of The Artful amoeba at Scientific American
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,487	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Possibility that plants can
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Do something like here so
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What do we have in our ears
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That we use
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To hear sound
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Right
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And if you go to too many rock concerts you can break
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Keith Harris and that leads to permanent hearing loss
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Too bad
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,407	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So maybe
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Root hairs which are always down
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Right at the growing tips
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A plant root
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Maybe plant roots
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	AR
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like little ears Maybe
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Which route is is like a little year for the plant I don't know
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That is cool
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That is definitely cool
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Okay good thing I don't get is is in any animals the hairs inner ear are sending the signals to a boy
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Brain and that is what chooses what to do that's true
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	If a plant doesn't have a brain what is
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Choosing where to go think Monica knows the answer to that
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But she does believe
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Let me know that we humans a little obsessed
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Weed the brain
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And so we
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Oranda decompression oil I would say the conviction
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That the brain is the center of the universe
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And and if you have a brain and nervous system yuan
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Good and you can do amazing stuff
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And if you don't run by default you can do much
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	General okay it's a very biased
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	View
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Humans have in particular
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Two words others
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But still I mean
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To say that a plant
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Choosing a Direction
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I don't know I mean it
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	La quina planta
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It bends toward sunlight we've all seen houseplants
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Would you say that the plant is
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Seeing the sun now I mean it's just it's it's
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Reacting to things and there's a series of mechanical
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Behaviors inside the plant that are just
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Bending in the direction to meet couldn't it just be like that
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Fair and I think if I move on to the next experiment from Monica
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You're going to find it a little bit
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Harder to objective we need to take a break first but when we come back the parade that I want you to join will come and see
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Swoop you up

EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To you
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	321 Chad Robert Radiolab so today we have a triptych of experiments about plants that apparently
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Jury still out
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are going to make me rethink my stance on Plants experiment to now
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are we now that is correct
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We are going to meet
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A beautiful little plant called a mimosa pudica with a perfectly symmetrical plant with
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	With leaves on either side of a central stem
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Eggplant I get so many signs
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Centuries
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Peculiar plant has a surprising little
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A reflex
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	An anti
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Predator reaction
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like a defensive mechanism as soon as it senses that are grazing animal is nearby
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	If a nosey deer happens to bump into it the mimosa plant
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Sleeves
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Curls all its leaves up against its stem
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The whole thing immediately closes up and makes it look like
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	There's no plans here
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Justin
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Boring set of twigs
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Nothing delicious
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	At all
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So do you like a Nobel
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Nevermind
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Right
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And you can actually see this happen so
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Mimosa pudica
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Can get anybody can get one of these pants on and we did
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And if you just
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Patrick even just one leaf that
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You can actually watch this Kaskade
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Believe closing
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah sort of
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Startling to see
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	ETSU UT
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:33,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So that voice belongs to a Tish Bachelorette who is with Princeton University's Council on science and technology
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We should one of these plans to him and a couple of his colleague Sharon Dela Cruz
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And Peter landegren
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because he wanted them to help us
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Recreate Monica's neck
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Experiment
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Okay
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Could you just described it just briefly just what you did
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Well I created these
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,023	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Horrible
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Contraption apparently she built some sort of apparatus
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I guess you could call it a
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Mimosa plant
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Dropbox
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Picture one of those parachute drops if they have it there
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	State fairs or amusement parks where your who stood up to the top except in this case
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Instead of a chair
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They got a little
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plant size box
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Into which she put these sensitive plants

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,207	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Drop them
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Just about you
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Seven or eight in London very comfortably
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Padded face made of foam
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So no plans with actually hurt
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Cindy's experiment
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But the drop was just shocking and sudden enough for the little plant do
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Close all
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Leaves
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What's reflex defense
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Ben Monica oyster plant back up again and dumps it again
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And again
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,599	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Allegan
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And after not all who want to drop
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plant
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She noticed
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Stop
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Closing its leaves
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So after the first few the plants already realized that that was not necessary
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:14,847	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plant stop
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What is it.
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Hope they stop folding up
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She thinks that they somehow remembered all those drops and it never hurt so they didn't pull up anymore they've learned some
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Exactly which is pretty amazing
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You couldn't just be at
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	An entirely different interpretation here
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like what the plants
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Have to keep pulling the leaves up and they just
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,559	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Retired
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They run out of energy exactly it's a costly process for
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Figured out they weren't
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,287	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because after dropping them 60 times
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She then
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Left right
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It would close up so
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It's not that it couldn't. It's just during the dropping it learned
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Let it didn't need to
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That's a
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Learning is something I didn't think plants could do
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They do
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Hi-Tech
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So we pick him up if it's this easy and this matter of fact we should be able to do this ourselves and see it for ourselves
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,263	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That's really split the scientist from Princeton come in theaters Sheridan
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They design from scratch
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Parachute drop in
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Blue translucent Lego pieces
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plant rapper and we can move it up
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And we can drop it
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Don't we just wrapped in our mimosa plant little she felt for him
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Down and then
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:39,071	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Account
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then we Let It Rock
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	5
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	3
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	2
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	1
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Dropped
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Five four
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,615	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	3 and we dropped it once and twice
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Again
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And again
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We waiting for the
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Restraint
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Stop both we drop
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We drop
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You didn't happen
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It was curling every time when it every time it just kept curly and curly
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So you can replicate what you saw it happened so we went back to my life as you know built
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Your elevator
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We did what happened to you didn't happen to a. Can you can you imagine what
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We did wrong
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Example my plants role in environment control room switch
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is Not A Minor Details then the no experience in extra changes oil
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	For example I don't know if that was the case for your plan
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No I doubt I'll be kept switching room cuz we weren't sure whether you wanted to be in the Highlight or week later
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	One light or no light it was my baby too much
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The Wizard of Oz
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The movie the plants correctly responded by not opening
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because something really mad what's happening around it and it's like
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	This place is not safe
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Atlantic on this point
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She's got a
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	CiCi's right one time the plant literally flew out of the pot and upended with r
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Roots Exposed on humanitarian
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The be kind of proved our point we were so inconsistent so clumsy that the plants were smart
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To keep playing it safe
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Can closing themselves up
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That's a very successful your experiments you found exactly what the plans would do under your shirt
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Circumstances
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,343	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Cardinal saib more
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Tumultuous the mine
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And she goes on to argue that we've been a little bit more steady and little bit more consistent
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants would have
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And would have remembered the last
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because what she does next 3 days later she takes these plants back into the lab
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Just to see like
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The difference between the first time you learned something in the next time they figured out faster this time or maybe
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Slower
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So she takes a plan
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She puts them into the parachute
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She drops
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,111	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And she says this time they relaxed almost immediate
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They'd remember straight away straight away
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	All of them
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No ready what to do
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	They remember what it happened three days before the dropping dinner that they didn't have to fold up
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So they didn't
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then she waited a few more days I came back they still remember
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Few more days
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah and it was almost like
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Eventually she came back after
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Unidays 28 days
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes and they still remain
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,647	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are they still did not close when she dropping that's what she says
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What was your reaction when you saw this happen that's pretty sure
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Retention of
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Of knowledge my reaction was
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That was my reaction
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because the only reason why this perriman
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Turn out to be 28 days it's because I ran out of time
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So did they might remember even
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How much longer time than 28 days
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So she saying they remembered for almost a month
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Can you remember what you were doing now I actually like even this morning I'm at that's already gone
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Supposing that she's right
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Where would the aloe plant even store a memory
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That's what I asked her I do want to go back there too
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Support for something like learning
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like I don't understand
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Learning as far as I understand it is something that involves memory and
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:40,992	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Storage but I do that in my brain that's the place where I can remember thing
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	In my brain
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes I do is a bro I think
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is your daughter came to my house
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Picasso and I forgot now
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Sorry
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Actually Monica's dog leaves
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Perfectly into her third experiment which
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Again will be with a plant but it was originally done with with
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	IDOC so Pavlov
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,816	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Started by getting some dogs
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And some meat Annabelle
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The kind of the standard
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And his idea was to see if he could
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,264	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Condition needs
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To associate
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That food would be coming
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	From sound of a bell
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So he brought them some meat
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then eat the meat then
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	He would bring them to meet and he would ring a bell
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And again drooling eating
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:50,880	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And he would repeat this
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Ring
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Meet
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,184	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Eat
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Ring
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,720	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Meat eater
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,024	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Ring meat
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Finally
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	One time
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,888	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	He did not bring the meat but he rang the bell
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:08,288	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Turn off the dogs begin to droop they had learned to associate the sound of the Bell Witch
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Nothing to do with me when they actually saw and smelled and 8B
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Exactly
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:16,736	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Animals do this experiment but
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It got Monica thank you
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Buddha plant
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The same plant learn to associate something totally random like a bell
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	With something
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It wanted like food
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:32,352	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are you like aggressively looking around for like you wake up in the mornings and now what can I get a plan to do that rhyme
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Reminds me of my dog reminds me of a bear
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Reminds me of Abby
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No really
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Lucifer I feel I feel this is the kind of good
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Society
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I don't do that
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But Monica says what she does do is move around the world with a general feeling of
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What if
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So she decided to conduct lyrics
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,232	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Pretty much like at the concept of Pablo with
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	He's dog applied but instead of dogs she had pea plants in the dark
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And for the meat substitutes you gave each planned
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Little bit of food in this case of little blue
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	LED light
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Light is obviously representing dinner if you if you shine light on the plant you're like feeding it
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Real I'd like to know that
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,992	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I need light to grow so
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,016	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Otherwise account
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So for three days three times a day she would Chinese little blue lights
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	From upper to
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Particular direction
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And she noticed that unsurprisingly the plants would always grow towards the light
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Endo knows that the salivation equivalent was
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The tilt of the plant except
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then I needed
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The difficult
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	August of this payment was
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To find something
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Being that will be
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Quite irrelevant
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And really meant
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Nothing
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To the plant
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To start with
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Liza Bell for the dog
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So after much trial and error with
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Clicks and hums and buzzes
EDL	00:24:58,112	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Randomness
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	That the one stimulus that would be
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The perfect was
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A fan
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A little fan the same one that are used in
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Computers light
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,632	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yunnan very tiny
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She determined that you can pick a little computer finkelman
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,496	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But we're going to keep them for pretty much ever
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Utterly indifferent to the whole
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:20,384	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants don't replace the fan right next
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,944	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So that
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Coming from the
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Same Direct
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	These two stimuli she put the plants
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Little pea plant
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What's 2 a kind of training
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Little fan goes on
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Light goes on of aiming at the people from the same direction and the people and leans toward
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:44,960	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Then she takes a little light and the little fan and move them to the other side of the plant turns the fan on
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,752	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Betway
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Light after Fender moved around always matched in the same way
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Together fan by Clean
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Fanfight Lee fan lightning
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Same as the type of the beldam eating the television
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The doggo you do not play the stand for
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	For the plant
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We know now for the dogs the dogs
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	He's expecting
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Predicting something to arrive
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	If it was only the fan
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Would the plant anticipate the light and lean toward it
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Be going random
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	After three days of this training regime it is now time
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants with
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Justify
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	No light
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Chuck Monica moves the fans
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The new place where
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	On
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And the pea plants are left alone
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Quiet
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Darkroom
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,744	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Feeling the breeze
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The next day
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are the uni on a Sunday afternoon goes into that
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Darken room with all the people at
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So you know I mean the dark she's got a little red headlamp
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah she moves about the room
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Tearing down
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plants under the red glow over head lamp
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then I
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Stop
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The these little plants
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	My Little Pony
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Indeed
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Turn and move
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Toward the fans catching up their little leaves as if they were sure that if any moment now light would arrive
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A scooter was Sunday and I remember it was Sunday because I study
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Discriminant
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Stop my plants
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	There's no one here on Sunday afternoon
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How can spin my head off your phone
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Oh my God
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	These guys are at
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She doing it so course that was the only the beginning then
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We actually had to run four months of Trials to make sure that you know that what we were seeing
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Was not one p doing out two piece but it was actually a majority
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So you just
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Did what problems did to a plant you got the
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plant tours
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,752	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Associated
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Fan with food
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But once again I kind of wondered
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:09,088	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Since the plant doesn't have a brain or even neurons
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:14,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To connect the idea of light and wind or whatever that weird would they put that information
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How can a plant
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How do you do that
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I don't know
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I don't know yet
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	But what I do know is that defensive line doesn't have a brain descendants
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Doesn't
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A priori
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Today's date
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The plants can do something
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Dependent humans do it enough
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It doesn't mean that everyone needs to do it in that way to be able to do it in the first
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,808	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Multiple ways of doing one thing
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So we're really like this is
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,464	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We're really at the very beginning of this
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yeah I know
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	This weather is often more questions than answers
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,864	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	This part of the
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,376	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Define as well
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Monica's work is actually gotten quite a bit of attention
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The mother plant
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,664	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes and some of them this is Lincoln taste
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Professor emeritus
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Biology at UC Santa Cruz stay there very curious but want to see these experiments with
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Repeat it's very interesting experiment
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I really want to see whether it's correct or not lead us to
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	He's got lots of questions about her research methods but really his major complaint is
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is her language are use of metaphor
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Write example words
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:33,312	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Like hearing or learning behavior and this is not a huge fan
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes if you get
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Too wrapped up in your poetic metaphor you're very likely
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To be misled
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And to over interpret the data
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It's a kind of Romanticism I think you know
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	It goes back to
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Anthropomorphizing
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Plant Behavior
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I wonder if
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Her using these metaphors
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,656	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,472	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Perhaps a very creative way of looking at
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:04,032	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Looking at a plant and therefore leaves her to make
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Make up these experiments that those who wouldn't think the way she would whatever makeup and therefore she might
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Indian see something that no one else would
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	What sea is it
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:19,136	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Pictures of metaphors letting in the light as opposed to shutting down the volume
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Just started like going off the deep end their butt
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Maybe it makes her sort of more open-minded than
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And then somebody just looking at a note
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I think you could be open-minded but
EDL	00:30:30,656	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Still objective
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I think there's something to that I I think
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	There are some cases
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:37,312	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Swear
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,896	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Romanticizing something could possibly
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Lead you
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Some interesting results to your like a a metaphor cop with a Milky
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Yes that would be an interesting.
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	How much longer cuz I have an appoint
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Home inspectors Alvin and Larry ubell
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,520	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	We thought maybe we should run this metaphor idea by then
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:12,384	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	There's on the science side there's a real suspicion of anything that's anthropomorphizing it
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	I just don't like
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	To hear words like mine or hear or see or taste for a plan because it's too animal into
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Too Human
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And the classic case of this is what you go back up
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	A few centuries ago someone
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Notice that plants have sex
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:30,048	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Oh yes that there was a kind of a moral objection to thinking of this
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And I'm wondering whether
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Monica is going to run into as she tries to make plants more animal-like
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Whether she's just going to run into this malice
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	From the scientific
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:45,664	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	You sure any of them know I don't
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Because
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	She may come up against the
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	People who think that
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Intelligence is unique to humans
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And so I don't have a problem with that I've been looking around lately and I know that intelligence
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:58,208	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is not unique to humans okay
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So I don't have an issue with that
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	And everyday that goes wanna have less of an issue from the day before
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	So I don't have a problem.
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	The problem is
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Is
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,216	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	With plants what they may have this
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Intelligent
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Maybe we just not smart enough
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Figure it out
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,848	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Well okay that's a Pareto
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Let's
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Do it

EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	For some reason people just don't think plants
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18smartyplants |	Are interest
