EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And moving in a different direction and then walking its paces and kissing across
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:32,095	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	As we watched it it turn once then twice then three times
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	4 * let it go back to where it started imagining tables the number of people sitting around
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Probably it's going to start up
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	At one point or another head for you
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And then turn away and head for someone else and turn away
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,527	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Why would the king of
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Spain
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	How who could have you know
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	I will build a church

EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Automatic.
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	What was that for
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Yeah lots of what was he thinking it's a good quote That's The $64,000 Question 2 grade question
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:17,151	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	The truth is there's really no way to know for sure
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	They got to rely on the vacuum
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And it's not a whole lot of that in this case one interpretation
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Certainly could be that
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Yeah the king had this amazing miraculous
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Thing happened to his son and now we had a way of sharing that
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	With his subjects
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	He's got this device worth it's a it's an illusion like the Machinery of it is completely him there's no visible
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	One of the craziest
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Sports that it's all sort of hidden underneath the the robes at when he put it down on a table or in a
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Courtyard
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	People have seen it move on its own
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	It would have been amazed
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	As we were
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And you could have said look here is the miracle
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Look what God did
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	For a country God like Spaniards what God did for Spain
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Which would have been a useful thing for a king to Beyonce right
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	That's that's one
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	The other is it just on a more utilitarian level
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	This was a machine
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	That was built to pray and this was a period when you could buy
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Prayer repetition so if you had the money you could get someone to pray for you
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	While you go do something else
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Are those over here when you're covered you're covered
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	If you think about it from Philips perspective he needs to say thank you to God
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And he had this thing that if you wound up
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Was an automated thank you machine
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you or could be

EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,399	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	But if you need
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	But if you think about it more expensively
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Salata
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	What did it mean at that time to be a Catholic
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	What it really mean
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	What a nice robot
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	With maybe the best Catholic you could ever hope to be counted his prayer was was
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Was quite specific
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	In the sense that if you say the right things and and do the right actions
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	In the right order in the right time and in the right place
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	That's
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Prayer that's when God notices about method
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,143	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	It's about method it's about
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Maybe this monkey says was like method embodied that's a good one
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	I mean why not
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	It is in fact
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Perfect
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	It repeats itself over and over and over
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Replicates the idea
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Is a little a little teaching object
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Where is how you do it
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	This is the perfect prayer
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Perfect
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Price of doing it the perfect way every time and I because I'm I'm just in a lowly imperfect
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Human
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	I'm not I can only aspire to this
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Perfect piety
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Are you making this up or do you think this might the month might have actually been seen this way, true I don't think I feel crazy
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Especially if you think about what was happening
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:07,135	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	At that moment mrs. counter-reformation Spain right not so long after Luther eunos nailing Theses on
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:13,023	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Has big debate raging about how actually do you get closer to God you have the kind of protest
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	With Luther were saying it's not about you know works it's not about saying something this many times it's about whether you feel
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	And then you have the Catholic argument which is to say
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	You do these rituals
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	Because these are the ritual
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	I'm using the way you get this is the way to get close to God
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18clockworkmiracle |	How's the way to pray
