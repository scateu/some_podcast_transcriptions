EDL	00:00:10,752	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,920	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And NPR
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:22,528	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is Radiolab on Jedi camera
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:23,808	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	There is no leaks by DIY got
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,088	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Custard with this
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:29,184	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You were some kind of an affair to tell you how I was at a party party
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:31,488	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It was a it was a
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:35,328	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Conference were there a lot of different people with different disciplines come together
EDL	00:00:35,840	00:00:36,608	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You know one of those
EDL	00:00:37,632	00:00:41,216	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Are panel discussions various things as we were at one of those functions
EDL	00:00:41,728	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:00:42,752	00:00:45,824	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	A lot of booze being serious everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:52,480	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So I was standing there with some violin
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:53,760	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Are the other fun ones
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:54,784	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The jump Palace
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:01:00,928	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	My people fairly and they they started to lose their ship
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:03,232	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Like genuinely lose their s***
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,768	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	About this thing called
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:07,584	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And like I've never seen scientist this
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,864	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Excited about anything I was like what is this
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,912	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What is crispr
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:14,240	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Trying to explain to me what they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:18,848	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I gathered it had something to do with genetics and then at one point one of the biologist tournament is like
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:19,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'll tell you what it is
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I can use crispr to take a little dog
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:28,576	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And poof make it to a big dog give me a Chihuahua I could turn it into the size of a Great Dane and was like no you can't
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:32,672	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	He's like yes I can I could do it with crispr I was like what the hell is this thing
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To sit here is you
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I will get up
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	No no no no
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:45,472	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Because I just figured for this kind of thing
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,848	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The car thing I got to talk to Carl
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:54,176	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So I guess I'm like why all the fuss
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Maybe it was just the alcohol or but maybe there's something really happening here
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,576	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Oh there's something totally happening there I mean it's
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,368	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	He started at the begin
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So that
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,208	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You you can actually find like the
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:07,232	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The first reference
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:10,304	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Spur in a 1987 paper
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And some Japanese scientist
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They basically
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:17,728	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Describe something weird and E coli and they said we don't know what this is
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,032	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	E.coli are bacteria inside human
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And like all living things
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Equalize made up of DNA and T's and C's Angie's and what happened was it the scientist
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Breeding a chunk of that genetic code
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	When
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,600	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They found this really strange
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Stretch of DNA
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:38,464	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Stretch out well so basically what it was
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,768	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	5 identical sequences
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,656	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	In a row
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,216	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And then they were separated by very short
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sequences in between them that were
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	All different from each other
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The little blurb should be like
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And they look at that sound like what
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But this is nothing like we've seen before repeated
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sequences in bacterial genomes are kind of unusual
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:13,792	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Seems very strange some biologists felt that there must be a purpose
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Among those purple sneakers Jennifer doudna University of California Berkeley cell biology
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah so it's not dude it's down used to be called the dude
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:27,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sometimes it's cool in the movie she will be played by Jeff
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Right anyhow
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:34,016	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Xango's on scientist are single repeat Loop repeats
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Everywhere
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Releasing bacteria lots and lots of lots of species of bacteria
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:44,256	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They say okay wait a minute it's kind of cool your findings it so often
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is this where the name Christopher comes from
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The full official name is
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,864	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Clustered
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Regularly interspaced
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Short
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Palindromic repeats
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	My God, I don't know why they called it
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Furniture
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It sounds like an app
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But now
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Scientist had the puzzle
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:09,856	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If nature at this level preserve something intact
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,648	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Here and here
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And here and here and here and here
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And some of these here
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Creatures that have been around for
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,583	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Hundreds of millions of years you figure out
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Whatever this is
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Doing something
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But what it doesn't take very long
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,775	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Before the first big clue
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Comes up

EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	2005 now scientist have these big searchable databases
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Of DNA sequences are some scientists
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Bank elasticsearch
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Let's see if these repeating patterns we keep finding match anything else
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's out there in the world
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,231	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The scientist guitar
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Using computers to just line up these stretches of DNA with thousands upon thousands of different species and then

EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'm sudden
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Discover
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Did those bits of DNA between the repeats

EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	These
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,199	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Are matching virus DNA
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Like you can find viruses
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	With
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Jeanswear
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:17,183	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The little you know these little to the bacteria had virus inside of them
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,255	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is that what that mean that it was a virus brought it
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Into this the first recognition was
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is virus DNA
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Somehow all these bacteria
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	A little snippet the virus DNA
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	West Indies
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Particular places
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Energy no
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Which is a little weird if you think about that means are totally different creatures
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It would be like inside a human finding a little bit of mosquito DNA
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	How do we interpret this well
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,135	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Actually there was one scientist named Eugene koonin
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To look at these results and just had
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay I guess
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is it offensive
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Why would you think that cuz he's a brilliant man I went to her if I went to a large
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sanitation dump
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And I found a teeny bit of
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:05,311	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Human hair why would I think
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I wouldn't know it just like a beauty human
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Well you see
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	That metaphor my
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sort of betray at your lack
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Skill in microbiology I'm just saying like this is not a dump all right this is
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Bacteria are not going to just
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Let virus DNA
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Get into their jeans willy-nilly
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay remember
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Viruses are the big anime
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If your bacteria
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,655	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Viruses make your life a nightmare
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,775	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Think about in the ocean okay the the ocean is
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Full of viruses and end
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Viruses kill up to 40%
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Of all of those bacteria
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Everyday
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Everyday
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We know that they have defenses
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	When Eugene koonin said was
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,695	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'm going to bet that
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,743	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	These bacteria
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Are somehow grabbing pieces of DNA
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,071	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	From viruses
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And then they're storing it
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And now they have a way of recognizing those viruses of
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They come in later

EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is Eugene koonin leader of the evolutionary genomics group at the national Center for biotechnology

EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	He's the guy that called reference to
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Stunk up the whole idea that maybe these bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is the bacteria trying to defend itself
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But but really if I if I if I
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If I could eat myself anything
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,751	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It was not so much kissing
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Because you know

EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So can you
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Walk us through
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,111	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	How the mechanism is likely to work
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	All right
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What happens if
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You know when the virus comes in
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	2
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	LaSalle
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,351	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I just kind of
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Explodes in Skyrim releases naked jeans basically
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you're this bacteria these things might take over yourself you've got to respond
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You can multiple
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Weapons of Defense
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:21,759	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you've never seen this virus before using the first thing you do says Eugene as you send out these enzymes
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Pack the viruses they're sort of like the ground troops
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And they fight really hard
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But much of the time
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Date fail and then nobody else you are here about
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You're not terribly sophisticated fighter so very often
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,007	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Taurus takes over

EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But there is some
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,199	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Nonzero probability
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Did you actually survive at
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you do then with the bacterial do with sending some new enzymes to basically cleanup
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Go out find any stray viruses.
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The enemy DNA into
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Beautiful small piece
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And here he says when you get to the storage part
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Does enzymes women take those little bits of virus and shove them into the bacteria's own DNA
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Right in those little spaces between the reef
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Right there and nobody else
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So I use those spaces in my own DNA as a storage facility
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You use a different memory device
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cuz here's what happened
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,791	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Next time that virus shows up
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Express jeans everywhere now
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You are prepared
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is where the crisper really gets going
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cuz instead of sending out the ground troops were probably going to get their asses beat now you can actually send out the big
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Guns
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	In fact with the cell does it will manufacture these
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Special molecular assassins
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And we'll give those assassin a copy
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,815	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Of that little bit of virus DNA it hasn't storage spaces thing here take this mugshot
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you see anything that matches this pattern
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Chilling
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And these attackers do we know what they look but one of them looks like
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Actually looks I would describe it a little bit like a clamshell
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Turn imagine Pac-Man become misshapen and rough
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Which one of these guys
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What it has is
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	A copy
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	That virus DNA
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's got the mugshot that is kind of waving around
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What then happens is that whenever the Pac-Man bumps into some virus DNA it pulls apart
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The DNA
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Unzips it
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Read it
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's not the right one goes on
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Nope
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And if that RNA has the same sequence then
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Digital locks in the DNA is trapped
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And molecular blades
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Come out and shop
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:24,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So this is smart scissors to it's like you're like the thing I got
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Snip
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	All right now we're going to kill
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It has to be exact has to be an exact match
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	When scientist first discovered this whole system
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They're fascinated they were like
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Still working it out there like I'm okay then
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What happens when this happens at 7
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cool
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But then
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	In walks the dude Jennifer doudna with a crazy idea
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What are the crazy radical this could be an amazing technology
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is a tool right this is a tool that we can use to cut DNA
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Where we want to cut DNA
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Her basic thought was when we turn this defense
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Into office
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	These things they seem to be really good at cutting
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Give me the only thing to cut the things that are on their mugs
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshots instead of them going after viruses
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Maybe they could go after a gene that causes
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Huntingdon
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Disease or haemophilia
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	For example a mouse with something like haemophilia
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,591	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is a diseases caused by one bad Gene
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So it is you take seasonal surgeon to give them the mugshot for the badge then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot in Emmaus
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Can you set it loose
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,087	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just like this program to
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Find that Jean and
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The scissors will end up
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cutting exactly
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Virginia wanted
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The bad genes gone
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Now the question is how do you put in the good G
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Right right
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It turns out actually going to Jennifer doudna
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,823	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Actually not as hard as you would think
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Really yeah apparently what you do is just
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:07,455	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Throw this new good Jean
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Kind of in the neighborhood
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,271	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Where they will genius
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just in the general vicinity you don't have to get super-precise and it turns out that you know there are repair enzymes that are
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,487	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Probably continually
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Surveying and checking for brakes
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	She says will happen is it inside the cell
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is repair Crews
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,399	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Come along to see the break
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The CD good Jean just sitting there next to the break to be like all right
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'll just take it in with the pretty guy in this space
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So so we take advantage of a natural repair pathway that cells have
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Dietrich both the Cutters and the Fig
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah now we're not assassinating anymore
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,135	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Now we're actually
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Engineering
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Oregon from killing to refashioning
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:05,311	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Designing jeans doing genetic
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Form of genetic engineering for
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,919	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	30 years yes but
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Not like
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Genome editing technologies have been around for a long time but none of them have been as powerful as crispr is
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:26,559	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	That's Beth Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz she was actually one of the biologists that I
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Drunkenly talk to it that thing Modern Art Museum I can't even really remember it
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:36,799	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What's the evening setting be so vague
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,359	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Back in the day
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is just like two years ago you would have these jeanatta things you would take one put in a cell and what happened before was
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You would give it
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Some instructions about where to go
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And it might go there
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But Michael did somewhere that's a kind of related to where that was
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Not only would it take left Staten Island did not find there but it would have cost you a fortune and taking up 6 months of your time to get that thing
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:09,311	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You know it's really easy to just give it that mugshot
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And it goes I'm going to find that guy exactly
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It seems to be pretty precise
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And it's
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cheap like the old tools would set you back about five grand to use them once crispr
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,319	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The 75 bucks
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And here's the kicker says Carl it seems
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,951	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	At the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria

EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It still works you can use the same crispr system
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,911	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Can you like do it if
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Hornets
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Vulnerable in anything I have not I'm waiting for someone to say
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Crispr doesn't work in species
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,151	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And I have not heard of that
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So basically what you have for the first time in science
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is Gene editing technology that is
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is cheap
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Precise

EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Landed on ER
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I really I literally had you know the hairs on the back of my neck worse in
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just processing the fact that this thing exists
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You know that you could actually
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Program it
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,359	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To cut DNA and
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just like this
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:21,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Molecular scissors and I can just program it cuts DNA where everyone
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It is amazing
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,743	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Unless
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Think about it

EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Which we will doing just
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I feel a cloud coming in over there

EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So did something
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:41,631	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:46,751	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:53,151	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is Radiolab on get up and run
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay so
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Clearly the possibilities are there to use crispr
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Tree diseases
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,247	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What if you could
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Get a little more fanciful
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Write like what if you can actually go back in time and resurrect long-lost creature
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is talked about a lot we Could reconstruct using a computer
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What did genome sequence of the ancestor of all birds was and that would have been
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Kind of dinosaur
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Anime could use crispr to turn the chicken into that thing
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	For what if you could take an elephant
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,591	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Snip snip snip
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Gradually turn it into his long-lost relative
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:18:59,199	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The woolly mammoth
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,503	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cuz they're related
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:07,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But if they're there but if you know the woolly mammoth Gina which they do cuz they
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Play Family Guy.
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Awesome boner some hair
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Then you could
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Compare the number of differences use crispr to crispr out
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,631	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The different parts of the elephant and put in woolly mammoth
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,703	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you can infect go backwards in Thai
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Time and make changes in obviously I think you can go the other way to item mean
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Humans are
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Good design word designing animals
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So if
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It doesn't seem to me to be a
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Crazy notion to imagine parents all over the world
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Taller children so silencing the short jeans and favoring the taller jeans
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:41,439	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Getting rid of wheat
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Muscles and going for stronger ones
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And on and on and on
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,095	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And I don't know where the designing stop
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We sorta got into all of this with a
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,215	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,239	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If you can
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Be very very jeans
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Specific and you learn more and more about genes over time
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Why couldn't you invent
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Why couldn't you make a
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Pig with wings you you might one day get supposed to get enough to do that there's no Wing in pig lab
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You know the best you can hope for right now is a woolly mammoth lab and that's down the hall from where the
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Where the the
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The real action is is it now there's a hall and at the end of the phone
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It may be 20 years from now but that's what you looking at
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Well yeah I think but the thing is
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Well because you can't make weight
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Baby Winnie the Pooh
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just because it's her evolutionary barrier
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:44,927	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay I don't think that we need
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,023	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Federal
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Department of Homeland Security I think we're okay there all right
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	But we do need
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is like
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We do need to like figure out what are we going to do about
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Crispr
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I mean they're going to be using crispr for cancer
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay I'm going to take me to take people's immune cells out of their body
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,247	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Unable to use crispr
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To basically allow them to make proteins going to be able to
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Grab onto cancer cell
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,720	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And attack their own cancer

EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,560	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'm not the same testing
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What what are you suggesting we should
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Cringe Lewis A123
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What do we do now I don't know we all come
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	If that's what you are you cringe
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,088	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You Chris
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Shoe creams with attitude
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Dial Beijing with with dragons
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You're saying
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You're saying oh my God
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Forget to that conversation with Carl was 4 months ago
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And a lot has happened in the
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:46,176	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And that time because of the question that you asked like where does the sacred begin and end with one of the lines that have been drawn
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	By Jennifer doudna and others was that we should not
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:56,160	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Use the technology on humans who haven't been born yet meaning not on sperm cells or egg cells
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Because if you crispr say an embryo not that is it that is a permanent change
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Right that is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And their children's children and their children's children's children you can't ask
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Person if that's okay
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Because you're doing it before they're born
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Send
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Becomes a real issue
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,944	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Imagine making these changes
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is and a cat
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:22,272	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Skate through generation after generation
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	You could affect the evolution of organisms
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And it's
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I want to say trivial but it's you know it's fairly easy to do it
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Wow kind of profound I feel it's really profound
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Profound but it was just an idea
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	That is until for the first time in history researchers in China have successfully edit the human genome in it
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Embryo just two months ago
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:48,896	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It was announced that a Chinese team used a technique called crispr
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To edit DNA in human embryos
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Now these embryos the Chinese team if they were created through IVF and they were not viable embryos
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Are not going to actually develop into a person so they're they're going to be discarded anyway I can figure it out with those
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:14,496	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Embryos what's the stop anyone from going further
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Physicians that they crossed an ethical line
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:23,456	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Just sort of thing could be sort of a slippery slope towards
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Okay
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Now that the Grinch party is
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's bread and Robertsons cement
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:38,816	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We called up Carl again we have to revisit we have to revisit because in our Armageddon conversation
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:45,216	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Getting which I believe I was extremely alarmist and you were extremely down putting I feel that I should do a small
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Small little parade
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Kobe
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Remember the Alamo remember remember China
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And you have to close you should just begin anytime you want like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are going to start from there
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'm sorry so are we actually surrounded by an army of clones with soup
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Super powers
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah but I think the Dyke has been opened I believe I'm going to quote somebody who said
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:19,520	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Maybe a few weeks ago I think he went maybe was last week even writing for naturally
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I think it was maybe with somebody named Carl
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:25,920	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Who said that the news from China and that news
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,688	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Could probably
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The beginning of an entire New Era and I think I said it was a historical moment
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And I and I still stand by that
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,928	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Do you feel differently now than the first time we talked
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I don't feel
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Different actually because
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Didn't really know
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Scientifics
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Surprise here
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	He says people been doing all these crispr experiments and all these different mammals
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We're mammals this is bound to have
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	In fact it may be happening more than we think
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	One account in the journal Nature has said that for other Chinese labs
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They're doing this kind of work
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Carlyle Soto
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Which she said was unsurprising to buttocks
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,136	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Surprising that the crispr work this Chinese team did
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,440	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Didn't work very well
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Kind of
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I mean in only a few of the cases
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Did they
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Really get
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Exactly what they want
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	They tried using crispr in about 86 embryos and they only got to work right and maybe 28
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	A lot of them Christmas made the wrong cuts and screwed up the cells and that led them to conclude that this is a technology that's not
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Not ready right now
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,760	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Replication in the human germline
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I agree
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:43,232	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We still are in this kind of fortunate position where we can say oh well it's dangerous
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,792	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So we shouldn't
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,816	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Use it
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I am human embryos
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I just don't think that we're going to be able to certify find Refuge there in like 10 or 20 years
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Dinner 20 years you know christopher wilby
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So sophisticated
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The people will be able to say
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,640	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I can get you
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The change you want
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,224	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And I can do it safely
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos that have
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	The alteration in the
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,112	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Particular Gene Yuan
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So then what
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Is that Jennifer doudna told us that this experiment similar experiments have been repeated in mice
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	With more advanced crispr systems cuz apparently there
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And there it was done with almost no error
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Sometimes I feel like we're certain displacing or ethical concerns on to
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Something that hasn't happened yet
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We really are concerned about what we're doing to the human gene pool you know it's already here
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Take as an example in vitro fertilization
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:43,904	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	About 60000 kids are born a year through IVF and it
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Probable that
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Some of those
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Parents chose what they wanted a boy or a girl and when people start doing IVF there was a huge controversy
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,632	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	See people said this was dangerous
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	This is unnatural
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I don't see
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Peoples
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of IVF
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:04,128	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Now I'm going to sound like I'm on Roberts out of this I mean okay so
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So I don't hurt okay alright okay
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:16,416	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	So you guys know about all the stuff going on Iceland where they're looking
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	DNA and you know they're looking for
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Disease genes and so on
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	And
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	When they're looking at these Icelandic people they found that some people
EDL	00:29:26,400	00:29:29,216	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Had a gene that
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Text them
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Against Alzheimer
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	President reduces our odds of getting also
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Let's imagine your doctor said no if you'd like
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,688	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	For an extra $1,000
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We will take these IVF embryos and we will
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Use crispr
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	To give them the Alzheimer
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Protecting

EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Would you like that you want to add that to your to your procedure
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:55,584	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Or would you like your child to

EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Teachers might here's my thing here is anything with this whole this whole thing
EDL	00:30:04,800	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said which is that
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	When it's not dangerous anymore
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:12,480	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	What will we do and I'm afraid we've already answered
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	That question
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:15,040	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	It's not it's not a
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Question that's open NE
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,624	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Because if we're already doing this kind of
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Stuff and who's going to say no to that
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Who's going to say no to that
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah we've already answered the question
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:29,376	| radiolab_podcast15crispr |	We may have
