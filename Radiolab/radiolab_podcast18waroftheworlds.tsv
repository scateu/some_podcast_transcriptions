EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Prove Advertiser
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Improve the federal regulators
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,816	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	They had the first amendment
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	They understood responsibilities of the newspaper manager
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	These radio guys were conflating advertising with programming they were frightening their viewers they were acting irresponsibly
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:56,384	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	And remember this is a month after Munich when radio proved that news really works
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	On the radio
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,504	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Well one month after radio news Pino comes of age
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Suddenly there conflating news accounts
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,088	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	With fiction
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	And they're acting irresponsibly new terrorizing the public
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	And to the newspaper industry had the perfect thing to hang their critique of radio on

EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	All those

EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	The panic and I thought it was this and I packed my bags and whatever whatever and all the sort of
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Reports
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:25,312	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	People miscarrying do you feel like that's all
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Memory embellished or what how do you clean up that I may give you let me give you an analogy okay
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	If you were asked 100 Americans today
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Did you see a plane fly into the World Trade Center outside
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	September 11th
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	I think you would get an extremely high percentage
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	People saying they saw that plane fly
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	But that's because it's part of our national visual memory
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	It's really a trauma and it's it's it's the kind of Hysteria Panic or talk about that moment in time and our relationship to the media
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Okay
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	But if you were to actually find out whose TVs were on live at 9:48 in the morning that day
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	And who was actually watching
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	It would be a discrepancy in that number
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,504	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Now am I saying all those people are lying
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,528	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	All those people are
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Confused

EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Of memory to the media is extremely calm
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	Complex indeed and we think Michael sokoloff for checking her facts
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	And if you believe as he does the 1938 Panic was
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast18waroftheworlds |	What didn't happen it wasn't as bad as
