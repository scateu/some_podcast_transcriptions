EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:28,416	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	An article in the Philadelphia Inquirer
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:30,720	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We're a little bit weird as to why we are calling you

EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:50,176	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	From a woman who says that she has donated
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:52,224	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Surmise to them and she wants to know what happen

EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Today the story of the of the woman on the other end of that phone call this is her story
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:11,424	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Might save their story so far my title transfer

EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,088	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That consumers
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,880	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Then we've got different ideas
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:33,440	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Different recollection what happened
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:36,512	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We started dating across the
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,560	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Ocean for a year-and-a-half and then
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,608	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He moved to America
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,936	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	5 days after we arrived they were married a few years after that
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,472	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They are pregnant with twins
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	When did you first know that something was up
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,568	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It was at the 12-week
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:50,592	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Screening
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:54,688	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They called the first trimester screening and they're checking for birth defects
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I think the most common one is Down syndrome
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But it was September 30th 2009 ultrasound tech
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Fetuses and shortly after
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,744	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The. Came into the room and
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Said that
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,072	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Only one of the twins
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,096	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Would make it
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And one of the twins at anencephaly it would die
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Within a few minutes or hours of being born
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He said he could see that because one of the twins had a round skull
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And the other one had a bumpy skull
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The bumpy skull show them that the skull wasn't
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,944	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Correct
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Round enough
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:29,760	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The brain in skull weren't forming properly
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,296	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Which is what anencephaly is
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Bookshelf
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I can believe that
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:38,464	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's difficult the process of think
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:42,048	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Copyright I just told this is identical twins but one of them
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Completely different from the other
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,424	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Making matters worse the doctor said that
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The unhealthy twin was posing a threat to the healthy twin
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And we were
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To be safe
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We would do a selective termination to save the life of the healthy twin
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:03,552	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Surterra says they were suddenly faced with this Choice actually talk to two priests on the phone about it
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Really yeah
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Her family is Catholic
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Jews raised Catholic
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,160	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I don't know I guess I wanted
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	See what their take was on this
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	This is fine. The direction want to go to for this radio story but
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Tell man suddenly interested basically what I was saying is would you come and do a blessing over the selection termination and what they say
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	1 Priest
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Said
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	No
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Jesus said he wouldn't do a blessing over a selective termination and then the other priest
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Said that because of
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Thomas Aquinas rule of
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Leichtag is called double account or something basically like the rule that if you
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	If a train is coming
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,160	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And you like
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You want to save the life
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Someone on the train tracks and you shoot the driver
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The right thing to do
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:52,448	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	After looking it up it's actually called the doctrine of double effect and she's
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Basically right maybe not the part about shooting the driver but the overall idea is that if you're trying to
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To do good
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:04,224	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And on the way to doing good you must inadvertently do some harm
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,040	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's okay in certain circumstances
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	As long as your intention
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Anyway the priesthood because you're doing this with the intent of saving
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Healthy twin
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He would be there and he would do it
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That's what a few weeks
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We booked the hotel we packed our bags in the night before
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Was really terrible for both of us cuz I don't know we had seen them on the screen and we're bored cat
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:26,751	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	This little
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:29,823	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Kid next day they go in for the procedure
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Going to the
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,407	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Room in the doctor
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What's the sonogram on me and
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,783	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Start getting ready and he said
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Your placenta has moved since the last time you were here
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The location where it is right now
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I don't think we should do this
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Does he set up if I Nick it if I if I even just make it a little bit
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Like you're going to bleed uncontrollably and kisses
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,471	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He said they wouldn't do on his wife

EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Any decisions taken at UNC
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,807	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's not our fault
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But then your healthy twin is more at risk Maybe
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Yes
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is like a nail-biter for the rest of the six months
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	According to Rostow's six months were
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Deeply strange just buying one of everything when you know those two babies coming

EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Think about it and I remember thinking like what if he's going to beat the odds like
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Do we need to arrange daycare and like
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You know we hadn't thought of that
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Then soon after Thomas started having seizures
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Start having trouble breathing
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Stopped eating and at the time I remember thinking
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You know it come on little guilin
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Eat some more like
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Eat some more than you'll be stronger
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,559	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I was I just eat
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What's up
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	How how
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	How long did Thomas live
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	6 days
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Texas
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He died in his arms newest Runaway
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	All of the people that loved him
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And then right then
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We called
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Washington Regional transplant Community they sent a van over to our house
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He picked up his body and took him to
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,743	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	DC Children's National Medical Center
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:08,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Okay so this is where the story really gets going I guess so how did that idea of donating is working
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Hey, do your head in the paper newspaper article or something there's
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,431	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	About a baby who would anencephaly who donated liver cells
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,199	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Most major religions support organ donation
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:30,463	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What happened next
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I think some letters
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is there a form letter it basically said thank you for your generous donation Thomas's Cornelius it with incentives
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	This place in Boston where they study
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Potential cure for blindness
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Had his liver 7/10 this place in Durham North Carolina where they study ways to treat
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Liver disease
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Cuz I thought I want to know
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Who ordered it which researcher got it and what study are they working on
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Because I had this new baby Calum to raise
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I put it behind the both of us
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But then
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Sarah says they got to the one-year anniversary
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,887	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The one-year anniversary felt like a big moment to me like that's when
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I can
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That's when it stopped being in the present and it can start being in the past
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,335	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You know just explaining it to people least I can say it was a year ago so they don't have to feel
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Stressed out when they talk
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Talk to me and it felt like a big deal like I think we were going to go to the cemetery and put some flowers on his
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Craven
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I wanted to
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Tell my family
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What were the results
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What is donation
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So she called the donor Family Services person at the place
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I picked up Thomas's body and she basically asked them any more information you can give us
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	About the specific study or the researcher
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It was published and they didn't have any
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So I just thought okay well I tried you know
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,311	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But you couldn't quite let it
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Go mean what you mean she couldn't quite Let It Go
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,175	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Curiosity
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But I also think she was having
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	On some level like a big conversation with universe
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I like this terrible thing happened
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	How do you explain it to yourself
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	In God
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And how the universe works I thought that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Karma work or if I was basically a good person and I've obeyed the rules good things with
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And whatever the reason these thoughts about Thomas and where he ended up
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You just there
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She had no real Opportunity Act on it so they're just going to come in and out of her mind
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Then around the two year anniversary
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,319	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Just now a year later I had a business trip to Boston
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Nose exhibiting at a conference
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,903	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Hynes Convention Center
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I Googled it and I saw that Skype inside Research Institute was just a few miles away that's where Thomas is Cornelius at
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Lunch break
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That's exactly what I did I called Sky pins
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I said you know I donated my son's eyes to this lab
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	A couple years ago and I'm here in town
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is there any chance I can come by for a tour for like 10 minutes
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Then with the weird been a weird phone call
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Yes I mean yes
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Yeah that would like a wake her up that's Elizabeth Mason again it was just very unusual surprise
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I didn't know what to do with it before never have gotten there for 25 years
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She said hold on let me
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Connect you to the right person don't hang up a lot of times they say something they hang up on me so I said please help line
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I started searching for someone to speak with her to figure out who that is but don't hang up
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And they connected me with someone in donor relations but it was
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Financial donor relations
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I would like
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,951	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Like the different not known organ donor
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But because they don't have any other donor relation that what you know like that was the person that gives the tours and deals with the public
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:48,863	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That she got to talk to me and she was serious as the one was
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	A little bit flustered but super nice and said
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We know it never done this before but yeah come on down will
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Give you a tour
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So excited I took pictures of the outside of the building
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I felt I stood in the lobby and I
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Put one of the brochures in my purse
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,855	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I just felt like I
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I can't believe I'm here this is like being in Santa's Workshop or something like
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I didn't think this was a place you could ask
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She's taking around
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Eventually she got taken to the lab where Thomas is corneas when
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And there were refrigerators with signs that said no food
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And then she introduced me to this guy called dr. James ziskie
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Who's the professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Med School
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He was eating his lunch at his desk
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Can she explain who I was
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And you said
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You thank you for the donation and do you have any questions for me
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Of course she did
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I wanted to know how valuable the eyes were like if they get thousands and thousands or take it one or two or like when the
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Delivery came with everyone excited or was it
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	No big deal
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:57,215	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What was the sitting on a shelf collecting dust over people doing stuff with it
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He put down his lunch and he said most of the eyes that we got her from people who are older just cuz
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Most people are older when they die
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	An infant's eyes are worth their weight in gold
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I was like that could barely speak
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Could you tell me why
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:15,391	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He said because they regenerate that
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Regenerative properties
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:22,047	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And he said if you don't mind me asking how long ago did your son die and I said about 2 years ago
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And he said well we're likely still using your son's
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Sales right now
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is that the one you love

EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	About what we're calling tiny moments childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when a kid
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So did something
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It just means you read back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that a kid
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:18,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:24,927	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Epic moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,543	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	If you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Go to radiolab.org brilliance
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,175	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Record short audio message for us
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Hey I'm Jared I'm rod iron Robert krulwich this is Radio are we okay yes oh Sarah gray when we left Earth
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Two standing in a research office in Boston and feeling good
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:19,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She got this Rose of a success until after that her and Rasika in the car and head down south to Durham North Carolina
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Thomas's liver and a bit of his Blood for Blood because it turns out that in the delivery room
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Right after birth Twins were born nurses had withdrawn a little bit of cord blood from both twins sent it off to Duke
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Where researchers were studying the disease that killed Thomas anencephaly
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She said they walked in
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:42,751	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Study coordinator this guy who worked on the Human Genome Project
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	A grad student
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They made all these different researchers who all seemed really excited about her twins blood sample
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I think it was just weird that one of them had anencephaly one of them didn't and they were genetically identical
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Play for them to compare
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:17:01,439	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Kappa Delta one of the researchers even told them that they had compared
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Thomas's blood to Callum
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:08,863	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They found there were a thousand differences in epigenetics between both twins
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:14,495	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They're called epigenetic Differences I think their genes are the same but the things that control the genes word
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	They began identical but then somehow in utero
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Little changes
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Set up between them
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Yes
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Fossil in a few this changes might one day explain the disease
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,367	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	In fact I even asked the grad student who work on it most closely
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Deirdre crop as a were you surprised by what you saw and she said
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	For me to be surprised
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,535	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That implies that I knew what to expect
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So we're just at the beginning of this trying to learn about
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So that's two roses like this is that is amazing yep is it to sort of
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,799	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	He's on a roll here
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So after visit to they got in the car drove down the street to this place called Saito net
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is there a town with liver ended up
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Basic recital net will take a solid liver
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And they liquefy it
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And then they inject the liquid liver into a baby
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's waiting on a liver transplant
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Plant as a bridge therapy
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Liquid liver
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Yeah they went in again refrigerators Petri dishes
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Issue with Thomas
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	His liver was bruised
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	When they got it
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:25,151	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So they couldn't injected into a baby then they told her that they were able to use it in an experiment
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To determine what was the best temperature to freeze infant liver cells
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Which is -150 degrees C
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	As you already know
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Okay have a rose and she says it one point as they were being walked around the place
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We watch to the break room
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And someone had taken a picture
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Of Thomas that we had handed out
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And they took the photograph and they taped it up in the break room
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	With a little sign that they wrote on it saying Thomas Gray was a donor here March 29th 2010
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And it was so excited to see that cuz I thought they're just as curious about us
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	As we are about them
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Like I was wondering who what kind of person goes to work and opens up a box with liver in it
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:09,183	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You're probably wondering what kind of person takes their loved ones liver and put them in a box and mail it over here
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So my name is Rupa Ganguli
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I'm a professor in the department of genetics
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	At University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:26,079	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Nella Rupa Ganguly just switched her for a second she said he's a kind of cancer of the eye called retinal blast
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Stoma which happens almost exclusively in children at this point
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She doesn't know Sarah she has no concept of
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	What's happening
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She is just studying eyes
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Philly Philly Philadelphia
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Nature studies tumors but she also needs healthy retinas in order to do her work now you can imagine that getting an arm
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Retina
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Is
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Not a very
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,351	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Easy task
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Because why would you get it on
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	From a baby
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I must have knew that if
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And when an eyeball comes
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It is not
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	A pleasant experience
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Right because
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	For a moment you have to think
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	The origin of the sources
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,247	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Stop this
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Eyeball
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,063	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Sad
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:11,135	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And every possible
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Setting
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	It's sad
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Sad and frustrating
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,815	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Only when a normal child dies
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That's what I can get this
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Set a horrible setup
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	In my mind
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She says often when the retina is arrived which is
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	After me once a year and you pull them out of their packaging you right away at you feel like
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Maybe you're trading on other people's misery
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,527	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I mean it's so bad
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	When a child dies
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But I am
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Asking for his
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Are her
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Retina
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Either way I had the sense of guilt
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	In my head
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,887	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Never but never spoken to
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Apparent
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Any of her stamp
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:58,751	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So when she got that email
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Did you sitting your computer and she read the email from the company that provided of the sample saying the mother of this sample
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Wants to get in contact with
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,991	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I paused I stopped
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,343	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Doing what I was doing and I thought
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Why does the mother want
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Talk to me
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That was my first
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:21,792	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Question
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	So
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I did not reply right away
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	But after my conversation with the lab I
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,056	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Took I think one day
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,104	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To compose a letter
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And I sent it back
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Do Saturday
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:40,992	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And they ended up eventually talking on the phone I told her I think
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	At the very onset that sorry you have to understand
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,880	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And that
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I feel awful
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:51,232	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You said she felt kind of guilty because she wished for the stamp
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Like almost by wishing for it
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She made it happen
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She said Aruba you should not feel bad about it
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	If you didn't use my son's retina I would have buried in the ground
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	You're the
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Only one that wanted
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Bad things happen to children
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	And so by being able
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To help you
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	With your work
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	We added a layer
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	To Thomas's life
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	That was
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	I was amazed
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	Eventually Sarah and Ross visita de roupas lab
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She gave them a tour
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15graysdonation |	She sold them thomases right now
