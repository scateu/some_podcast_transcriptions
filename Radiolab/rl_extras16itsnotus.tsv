EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And so we moved

EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,975	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It's hard to like hear the finished product
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's just a listener

EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I think we should underestimate
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,551	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,831	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So

EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It'll definitely get you closer to God
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,015	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's what ya God does exist in India
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:40,927	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So my aunt started out as a civil rights lawyer in India often defending people who he thought have been

EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Life After Life I think of
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:24,863	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That was our afterlife episode it was a series of meditations
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:31,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Undeath this hour we ask that question I did what happened
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:37,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	At the very moment when you slip from life to the other side and what happens after
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,479	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And resulting it I was just stunned silence

EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,551	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And once the
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,599	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Was it seems that's always stuck with me
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is the
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,463	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I remember you were talking about a group and it said
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:55,839	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What happens when the group dispersed some people go their separate ways
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,655	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Does a group die or do they carry
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It with them this was a short fiction p
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Peace by the neurology
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:06,079	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is David Eagleman which was right on our show by the actor Jeffrey Tambor
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:08,383	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	When soldiers part ways at War's end
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:12,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The breakup of the platoon figures the same emotion as the
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,039	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Well the death of a person
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Participants
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:22,207	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Gamble away feeling that they were just part of something larger than themselves something they into it had a life
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,303	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Even though I can't quite put a finger on it
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:31,167	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In this way death is not only for humans but for everything
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:31,679	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That exist
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,263	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And it turns out that anything that enjoys life
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,287	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Enjoys an afterlife
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,359	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And then there was something about when you pass away
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What happens to the
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do the things that make you up when you die

EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'd never thought about where life begins and

EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:36,191	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And my uncle mentioned another Eagleman piece that causes a year
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	There was this one thing that you said which was

EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:45,151	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	When the Lost person
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:45,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Speaks your name
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,455	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's when you're gone
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:48,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	There
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:49,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	R3
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:50,783	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Guess
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Now the first is when the body
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,927	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The second is when the body
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,231	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Consigned
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,023	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Foot in the grave
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,839	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The third is that moment
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,399	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sometime in the future when your name is spoken
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,703	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	For the last time
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:15,615	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	With my father and my grandfather
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,895	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know the TV
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Forget them today
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,711	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	UWE
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:21,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Stop bossing on their stories in
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	No one remembers him
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's when
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,111	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's when they're gone
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,903	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's actually gone
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,207	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So you're listening to this
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:34,047	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Are they any other people listening and there's this kind of Deep Quiet in the car
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,071	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah and then what
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:40,959	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So that happened and then that was my introduction to listening to podcast
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:42,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So then I started listen to Radiolab more
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:47,103	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And who did you have a lot of time on your head about what's going on after school what happened
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So what happened was
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,943	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Even in school
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I've been a loyal
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,295	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I had reached this point where I thought
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:17:01,951	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know I was done with human beings I was done with human right I was done with all of that stuff because I felt like
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,487	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The we were just
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Too far beyond
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,559	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Receiving
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,119	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I feel like
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Clearly this is not where I should be
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:12,703	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because there's
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,007	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	A big Oval Drive trivia some affinity
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But what are you what are you decide to
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,847	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What was the news
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,639	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I wanted to go back to school
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I wanted to study ecology
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I attended the
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's awesome
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:25,503	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Ecology
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,807	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm completely blew my mind and I decided
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You look good I'm not on the right path maybe this is about
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:32,159	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Should be on
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:37,023	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I remember we was living in Brooklyn right across from the botanic gardens
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,559	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,887	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Even through the winter I go there and I will listen to Radiolab
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Honda
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:47,007	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Everytime I think of Radiolab I think of
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Smiles and tears
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:51,103	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So streaming down my face
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,895	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	There's always
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,735	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So much emotion to tell if backed into it
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,015	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Babysitting the
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,807	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In the cold
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,623	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In the snow in the botanic gardens no one else around
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,415	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	With a small notebook
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:09,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'll listen to Radiolab and every time something would come into my head at jot it down
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:13,119	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So sitting there in the botanic gardens listening to us like what what what
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:13,631	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To the Dufour
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So open me up and help me together
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Did both things right
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,287	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Open me up to
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The new world
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	If ideas and Thompson
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:26,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	A community of people who
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,479	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Also have similar thoughts
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,783	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You also want to find out more about what
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,295	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Going on
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,623	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And also help me together because I was
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,159	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sold by myself
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,767	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm very very fortunate
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,559	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Have my wife with me and she was
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:45,631	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Let me she's been a huge bill of Sapulpa
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We have bolts
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,471	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So to step out of our comfort zone
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	An affordable Visa
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,103	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To some extent
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because of Radiolab
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:58,431	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Every time I hear the
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,967	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Opening credits of Radiolab
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,575	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It feels like I'm just stepped back home from the cold or something it's just
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,599	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You don't shake off
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:08,159	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	All the snow from your jacket
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,439	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Unsettling
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You do feel like you sort of
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,535	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Solve something
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I hope not
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,375	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I hope not but I totally feel
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,655	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Are you happy about where I am
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It's interesting
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	If you if you listen to the show we do we never solve anything
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,847	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's right yeah
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You never do
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,407	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So you know what this was
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,247	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	This is something I've been thinking about a lot recently and I was speaking to a very close friend about this
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I was thinking about what is the rule
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Scientist
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I found it
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,743	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	More recently been there have been things that make me
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:47,583	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Wonder what the scientific Community is looking out for some time
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,887	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I think sometimes
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,935	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Will Solace caught up in
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,471	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Our credibility and the fact
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,543	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We must maintain The credibility and we shouldn't break rank
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,615	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Put new one
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:03,455	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Becomes a scientist because they read a really credible
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Scientific
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:04,735	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	FIFA
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:09,087	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Bereaved did they become scientists because they're inspired by
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:13,183	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	This world around them and they're just really curious about what's going on
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You inspired me to
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:18,815	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To be more curious
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Beretta
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,655	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To recognize that we don't have answers
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,727	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And sometimes just looking for questions
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:29,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is enjoyable it's a lot of fun
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,639	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What I do together
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:36,479	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To be looking for things together to go on this treasure hunt
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,783	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Around life together
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That's home
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:44,415	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Robert I think I might be in love with my uncle
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,791	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	When we shook hands I remember like holding onto his hand like for an ex
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,815	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Extra beat because
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,631	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	When you do this for a living you don't expect
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do anything much more than tell a story
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But if you can
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:04,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	If you can help somebody get out of a hole or climb a mountain or change
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:06,431	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	No change a life then like that
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Cherry
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:07,967	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	On top
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:10,527	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Super duper cherry on top and I happens
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,551	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Carly
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,855	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Not on off and on
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:14,879	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Show
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So that's really cool
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,208	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I just had to
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:22,048	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Just say like if you listeners if Radiolab has touched your life
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:28,960	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	At some point in this past year doesn't mean they had to have a career makeover
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:33,312	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was just like it made you smile or it made you think about something a little bit
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,336	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Differently
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:39,200	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We ask you to remember you're part of a community and this community
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:41,504	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is held together with listener contrib
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It really is what keeps
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,320	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Radiolab
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:47,392	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So let's suppose you were in the mood to give
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,440	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Radiolab something how would you go about

EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:35,008	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Well you don't want to meet her so here we go
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:41,408	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Okay so a few months back we did a story called alpha-gal
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:44,224	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm getting nervous
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:49,088	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And the star of that show was a woman named Amy Pearl get my EpiPen
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Allergic
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,648	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To radio greatness
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:56,512	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That I know of has been really exposed to that yet
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:59,072	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm Robert.
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:00,608	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The story was about any pearls
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:06,752	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Allergy to red meat and how she got the allergy to red meat so I'm going to tell you anymore she goes in the story lesson right now
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:13,664	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But the reaction got from the audience on Twitter and in comments on our website which is insane you should we get kind of like
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:17,504	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know the outcome and hear their love the show hate the show where's
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,784	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Science stuff like that
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But this time it was just like this
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,904	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Huge outpouring of deep deep love for Amy Pearl
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:30,816	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You don't get that girl her own show she's incredible she changed my life Amy Pearl for president was one of the tweets
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:37,216	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I felt the same love her that everyone else did in my Java the show is again a lot of cutting tape and sound design and
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,240	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Music and stuff like that
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:41,568	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So I never actually like met her before but I met her through her voice
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I also
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,152	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Thought how she's very wise
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,968	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In ways I feel like I really need in my life right now
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:54,880	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And so this is one way to get more it'll bring more Amy Pearl back into our lives again which feels good
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,160	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Good hello hey

EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,944	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Probably
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Last night

EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,960	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	On the side

EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Lectin
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,920	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Every oak leaf look like
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,200	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Meloetta
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:03,552	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	MSN there such a pretty shape and I was like oh my God
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,112	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	These are just being thrown out by the tree
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:11,744	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	These are not even like of Youth and I was like well every single year it grows up
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,280	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Brand new Leaf
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:20,448	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And then dropped it off and the girls another one dropped it off and grows another one drops it off at a must-have for like 200 years of Michael
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:26,592	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Imagine how many leaves the tree drops off in like where does it all go and like what is all that energy coming from and why
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:27,616	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Doing it
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,920	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And it smells good
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,432	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Pretty
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:38,112	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Probably covered in dog piss but I didn't get that close
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:41,184	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I thought it was really beautiful and it was like
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,000	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was a good moment
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:49,120	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Amy Pearl
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,656	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Bath
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:55,008	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You don't like she was so when you hear Amy Pearl talk about anything
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,080	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Dog pee is fine
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,920	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because Amy Pearl is what is what you would call a moor inn
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:02,944	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	F
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,224	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tea
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,760	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What's that a natural storyteller
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:10,368	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	There's no way yes there's no way she can't make everything interesting
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:14,464	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And cheats to win this tape came in when we heard it we want oh my

EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,536	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Friend don't take her off
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,096	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We could just live on a mean girl
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:24,704	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Now listen though Robert there's a reason why
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:31,104	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We were able to get Amy Pearl on the show
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,640	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Feel precious but don't always
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,224	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do the thing that precious things have to do in order to keep
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:42,368	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Keep other precious things alive and well I don't know what that means but I think it was an attempt to say in a poetic way they
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	People who love the podcast
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:46,208	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And give just a few dollars
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Make this work
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,560	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Possible and exactly what I'm okay
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:55,680	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I want to add something we actually have some really great radiolab's swag

EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,560	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm sure that when we look at each other we give
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:27,680	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You can get the swag without making just a little donation
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,472	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And we ask
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,032	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Funny you ask Robert let me
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:35,360	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tell you radiolab.org donate

EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,280	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And that
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,048	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Question was
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,352	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Perfectly encapsulated
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,168	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	By this interview with this woman
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,448	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Emily Bartell
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:33,216	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You could add something like
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:34,496	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	She want
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:38,336	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm on a Bartell I'm a Libra enjoy long walks on the beach
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:44,224	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So this story came to us from our senior editor storm we literally just heard back there
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,528	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And basically The Story Goes Like This
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:52,416	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tony Bartel is from a family that lives and breathes and bleeds
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:58,816	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Football her dad Mel Farr the Superstar was a star running back for the Detroit
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:31:05,216	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Lions he was a two-time pro bowler both her brothers were professional football players until 4 Monday 1
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:06,496	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	First son Parker
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,544	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	As soon as the doctor
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,592	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Saw his third thumb
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:20,576	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	We're going to the NFL baby yes and then Parker's 10001
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Announce
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:23,392	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He's the biggest thing he walked out the room
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:27,744	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm still going with 3rd Stop
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,536	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	She signed Parker up to
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,352	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Play Little League when he was 4 years old
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,168	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Immediately they named in the tank
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,496	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The moment he gets on the field he is just
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Wound through kids getting touchdown after
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:42,080	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Touchdown
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:45,408	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But this is where things get complicated because
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,456	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	While Parker is on the field
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,224	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Dominate
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:50,784	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Monet has a relative
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:56,672	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Who played football for a very long time and was experiencing symptoms of CTE
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,464	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,768	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Which is the what comes from like
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:01,536	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Concussion questionnaire
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:05,632	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Symptoms include memory loss sometimes bouts of anger
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,656	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In this case
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:07,424	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,216	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Depression it was
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,008	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Suicidal Thoughts
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:12,288	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,848	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was getting phone calls
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Like hey I need you to come
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,152	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Come get him
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:18,176	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,968	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He's having dangerous
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,480	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Thoughts
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:27,392	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And money told us that eventually her father started experiencing symptoms of CTE as well
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,416	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And that
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,440	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Put money in a very
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:30,976	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Difficult position
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:35,072	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because on the one hand she believed that children should not play foot
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:39,168	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But then it's exact same time she believed children should play football
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:40,448	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Did it say
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,216	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Great sport
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,520	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Jasper Parker
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,288	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Parker

EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:47,360	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	His favorite things
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:49,920	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Were the trophy and the pizza party at
EDL	00:32:51,712	00:32:52,992	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Had no desire
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,784	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You want to play again next season
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,552	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Now
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:59,648	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Now our favorite moment of this whole story and allow listeners to
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:00,928	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Who's win
EDL	00:33:04,768	00:33:09,632	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Parker comes home from school and sits down with Soren and Monet and Soren ask
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:12,704	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Look if you don't like football anymore do I go sports

EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:32,160	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Mostly because when I saw something about it
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,184	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Kind of cool like

EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Threw us all for a loop
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:49,120	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	My dad was like the healthiest person that we know
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,144	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And he

EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:19,072	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Expecting that at all

EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,448	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That jokingly would say my
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:27,520	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Having a conversation with my dad towards the end of his life
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:30,080	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Would be like I'm 50 First Dates

EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:45,952	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Think about it
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,768	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And then getting the results back for my father
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,048	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm like God

EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,840	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Space force
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,144	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is Mike Webster
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:57,984	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Just to jump in here Mike Webster was a former professional player
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:01,056	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Who was suffering from Amnesia dementia depression
EDL	00:37:01,056	00:37:01,568	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You died at the

EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:09,248	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Junior Seau was another former professional player
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:10,016	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Shot himself in the
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:11,040	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Winchester 243 or
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,344	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	CH4 is something
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,392	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But these families are
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,160	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Suffering
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:17,952	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because they're watching their loved ones
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:19,488	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You can't take it anymore
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:21,536	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So they think that taking their lives
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,816	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is the easiest

EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:17,599	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Matter in a year

EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:30,655	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In a way that few
EDL	00:46:31,167	00:46:37,567	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Hi my name is Tracy hunt I'm reporter here at videolab and I wanted to talk to someone who has a very different
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:39,615	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Relationship with giving lacera
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:41,151	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Hello Sarah Gray
EDL	00:46:41,151	00:46:42,431	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Oh hey there you are
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:44,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	How are you I'm good I'm still good
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:48,063	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sarah was the star of the show that we did a little while back called Grace donation
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:54,207	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I guess I'm like a little bit nerd famous now
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:59,583	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Will just nerds know who I am you don't need to listen to Radiolab
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:01,119	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Just a quick recap
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,143	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sarah
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:05,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tell the story about how she was pregnant with twins
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:06,239	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Thomas and Callum
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:08,799	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And something was wrong with Thomas
EDL	00:47:08,799	00:47:10,847	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Doctors told her that he had anencephaly
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:12,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Being bored
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:13,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He said he could see that
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:16,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Because one of the twins had a round skull
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And the other one had a bumpy skull
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:24,415	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	She ended up giving birth to both of them and Tom aside six days later
EDL	00:47:25,183	00:47:29,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The Washington Regional transplant Community they sent a van over to our house
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:32,351	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He picked up his body and took him to
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:34,143	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	DC
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,679	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Children's National Medical Center
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:44,639	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So the story was about how Sarah ended up going on this journey trying to find out what happened to all the bits in
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:51,039	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Pieces of Thomas that were donated so she talked about for example going to Duke University where they were using cord blood from her
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:57,439	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Twins and they're actually researching the disease that killed Thomas anencephaly and going to University of Pennsylvania
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:48:03,839	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Talking to women there who was studying this I cancer that mostly affects children call retina
EDL	00:48:03,839	00:48:06,911	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Blastoma eventually sarin Ross visited Aruba's lab
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,447	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	She gave them a tour
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:10,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And she showed them Thomas's retina
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:11,263	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	She still has
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:13,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Samples of it in her
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:14,591	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Freezer
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,359	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tiny little
EDL	00:48:16,127	00:48:18,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I don't know tiny little vials maybe you
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:20,735	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Third the size of your pinky filled with frozen liquid
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,503	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Liquefied
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:25,855	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Right now it didn't look like much but it was amazing to think of how many
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:27,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	People were involved
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:29,439	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Getting the samples there
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:30,463	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Like we had to
EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:35,583	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Approve it we had to fill out this paperwork done the doctor had to come and remove the eyes and I had to be process
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:36,607	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	If not I have to be
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:38,143	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Shipped up there that they have to
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,703	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do whatever DNA process they do in
EDL	00:48:42,751	00:48:43,519	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I don't know valuable
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,311	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Maybe even priceless
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,591	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The simplest
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:51,199	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Since the show came out she released a new book called A Life Everlasting
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:57,599	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I just really wanted to get on the phone with her and just talked about what the impact of the show has been and what's
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:58,623	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Going on with her life
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:01,951	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And one of the first things I found out was that she had a new baby
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:08,095	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yes we have a baby girl that she was just born in June congratulation thank you
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,887	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He's doing great
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:11,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	This is Thomas's brother
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:13,727	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	He can now read a little bit
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,495	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The first grade
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,543	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And he's liking his
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,055	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sister
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:19,871	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What what have you told him about Thomas
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:21,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So he knows that he had a brother
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:26,527	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I was a twin who had a very very very bad boo-boo on his head
EDL	00:49:26,527	00:49:28,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah and that's why he died
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,367	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Let me just explain you know
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:34,719	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sometimes kids die that's just part of life
EDL	00:49:34,719	00:49:36,767	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	People in other cat diseases just like grown ups
EDL	00:49:37,791	00:49:39,327	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And it's okay to die
EDL	00:49:39,327	00:49:41,375	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Does he ask you questions about Thomas
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Can we visit the grave maybe one or two times
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,703	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The year and
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:46,495	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	When he was younger he asked
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:49,567	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is Thomas scared under the stone
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,871	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So when he was probably maybe two or three
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,151	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Questions like that were hard cuz
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:54,943	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know I don't
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:56,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Explain the afterlife I don't understand
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:57,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Myself
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:50:00,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah so I just told him no he's not scared
EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:04,159	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know he stinks of Thomas's being in heaven
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:08,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But he also asked me it'll can you tell me what is it like in heaven
EDL	00:50:09,023	00:50:09,535	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I said
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:11,327	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know it's really like her
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:13,119	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Wringing my hands are cold what do I say
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:17,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Well you know some people think it's a place you go when you die
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:19,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Some people think it's got clouds and
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:20,799	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	McCallum just goes up
EDL	00:50:21,311	00:50:22,591	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You look it up on your phone
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,711	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	What you wanted a picture
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:29,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	IPhone
EDL	00:50:29,759	00:50:35,135	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Do you know this way to be real but be real but this is what people think you show me a picture of God
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:41,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know stuff like that but you know sometimes it's hard and then sometimes it's easy
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:49,471	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And also since the show Sarah has kept on donating in fact when her daughter Jocelyn was born
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:50,239	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Born
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:52,287	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I was inspired to donate
EDL	00:50:52,287	00:50:54,335	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Placenta and the umbilical cord
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:56,383	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It was turned into four different
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:57,407	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Skin grafts that are good
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:57,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Used
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:50:59,455	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And surgeries
EDL	00:50:59,967	00:51:00,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	For burn survivors
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:03,551	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And also the umbilical cord blood went
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:04,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To research
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:10,463	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But also she's been inspired to track down the people who have donated things to her
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:11,743	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Idea
EDL	00:51:11,743	00:51:13,023	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	For checking.
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:19,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Blood donors when she was in the hospital with the twins she actually had a traumatic delivery she lost half of her
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:24,543	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Blood and she ended up getting a transfusion from 11 different blood donors
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:27,615	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So I emailed the blood bank and I've met with them
EDL	00:51:27,615	00:51:30,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And they have sent out a thank-you letter from me
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:36,063	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	To those 11 people and when Sarah was in the hospital with Jocelyn Jocelyn actually got some donated breast milk
EDL	00:51:36,063	00:51:37,855	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I ended up saving the bottle
EDL	00:51:38,623	00:51:39,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Actually framed it like you do
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:42,463	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Just tears me up to think of
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:43,231	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Strangers donating
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:44,767	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:46,559	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But you know the breastmilk place
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:48,607	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I said this is my donor ID for the breast milk
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:51,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Can you tell me who who are the people that donated this milk can I see
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tell him thank you and this is all kind of
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:55,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Like I know I sound like a donation weirdo but
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:58,335	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You don't think you receive and you give them
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:01,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I think it's neat to make the connection find out how that really work
EDL	00:52:02,431	00:52:08,831	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Since we've recorded the episode with you have you heard me like anything new come out of the research using your sons
EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:09,855	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Tissues
EDL	00:52:09,855	00:52:11,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So there's a study that came out
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:16,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	On tissue that could be my son's cornea this lab in Boston
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:22,143	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	They've been studying corneal blindness because when your corneas are damaged those cells
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:25,471	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Would you lose them that they're never coming back they don't regenerate their just
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:26,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Dad
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:27,775	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Have corneal blindness
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:32,895	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And so they're trying to figure out ways to regenerate them so corneal cells
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:33,919	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And they wounded them
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:37,759	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And then added umbilical cord blood to those cells
EDL	00:52:37,759	00:52:39,039	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And they found some
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:41,855	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Early-stage steps to show that these
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:45,695	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Corneal cells might be able to regenerate with stem cells which I believe is
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:47,999	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Kind of weather getting out of the possible
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:49,279	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Stem cell eye drops
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,559	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Deer Vision back
EDL	00:52:50,559	00:52:51,839	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Oh wow
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:55,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So this is like way way way it's the beginning of
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:58,495	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know what if situation and what if we could make eye drops like
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:01,567	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You talk like that the research
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:06,687	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	How often you do whatever I feel like it does it feel like you're kind of
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:09,503	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Lake kind of
EDL	00:53:10,015	00:53:16,415	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Continue in your relationship with Thomas in some way by by checking on these things I don't I don't know what you call it
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:17,439	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I feel like Thomas
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:20,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You don't he lived
EDL	00:53:20,255	00:53:22,303	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And he died and he made this
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:23,583	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Contribution
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:26,655	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I'm like a spectator kind of
EDL	00:53:27,167	00:53:27,935	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Watching
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:30,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	How is contribution is
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,543	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Affecting other people
EDL	00:53:33,055	00:53:34,335	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah and I'm
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:36,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm more like learning from him
EDL	00:53:37,151	00:53:38,687	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Then having a relationship
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:39,455	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Abraham Butler
EDL	00:53:40,223	00:53:44,575	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah yeah yeah I'm not sure that relationship is the right word I was just trying to like
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:46,111	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It's almost
EDL	00:53:46,623	00:53:51,231	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I don't know I I don't want to say like it it's like he still there and nothing like that I just
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:51,999	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You know like he's
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:55,071	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I can still very much a part of
EDL	00:53:55,583	00:53:56,351	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Your life
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,119	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In some way
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:59,423	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah he's still relevant yeah
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:01,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	New Life did not just affect my fan
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:02,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Is life affected
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:10,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Many other people and in fact Sarah told me that eight months after the show came out she heard from the
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:12,223	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Miss couple in California
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:14,015	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In California they had twins
EDL	00:54:14,527	00:54:16,319	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And unfortunately one of them died
EDL	00:54:16,319	00:54:17,087	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Unexpectedly
EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:18,367	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And I believe they ask
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:20,671	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Could they donate and groupset
EDL	00:54:21,183	00:54:24,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	You can't donate for transplant cuz your child is too small
EDL	00:54:24,255	00:54:27,327	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And if it will be her Radiolab can we donate to research
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:29,631	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And they said
EDL	00:54:29,631	00:54:30,399	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yes
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:35,007	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And their daughter was able to donate eight different tissues to eight different studies
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:38,591	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Yeah and in fact the retinas
EDL	00:54:38,591	00:54:41,151	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Went to the same
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:42,943	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Lab in the same researcher
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:45,247	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	That received my son's retina
EDL	00:54:46,015	00:54:46,783	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	LOL
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:51,647	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I know the other weird thing is that they're twins were born on the exact same day as my twins
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:53,695	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Pets
EDL	00:54:54,463	00:54:55,231	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Bethel Park
EDL	00:54:56,511	00:54:58,815	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm really I'm really kind of speechless of that
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:54:59,583	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Now that happens
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:03,935	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	It is for me it was bring back so you know when my child died
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:04,447	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Cilic
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:06,239	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Google control
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:10,079	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But being able to donate gave me a sense of control
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:11,871	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Back that you know at least this is
EDL	00:55:11,871	00:55:12,895	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	This is one thing I can
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:13,663	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In control
EDL	00:55:13,663	00:55:14,175	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Great
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:17,247	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	So I was glad that it had that
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:18,271	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Impression hot.
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:24,159	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sarah talking to me about
EDL	00:55:24,159	00:55:26,719	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Trying to regain a sense of control
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:28,255	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In the face of
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,791	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Unimaginable grief
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:33,375	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Remind me of something else she said at the end of Grace donation
EDL	00:55:34,143	00:55:34,911	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Are you stupid
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:37,215	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Like the universe
EDL	00:55:37,215	00:55:38,751	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Treated people the way it should
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:40,799	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And now I don't really believe that
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:42,079	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	But I'm
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:43,103	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I do believe that
EDL	00:55:43,615	00:55:44,127	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	There are
EDL	00:55:45,151	00:55:46,431	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Really amazing
EDL	00:55:47,199	00:55:48,479	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Kind people
EDL	00:55:48,479	00:55:48,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In the world
EDL	00:55:50,015	00:55:50,527	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And
EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:53,087	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Science and medicine has something to
EDL	00:55:55,903	00:55:56,927	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I started feeling that
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,231	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Thomas his colleagues
EDL	00:55:59,231	00:55:59,743	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Endoscope
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:02,047	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And that he was a valuable partner
EDL	00:56:02,047	00:56:02,815	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	In the
EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:04,351	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Important research that was being done
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:11,263	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Can I feel 10 even more fundamental shift almost like I had felt like I was a boat on an ocean that was like
EDL	00:56:11,263	00:56:12,799	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Rocky and choppy with waves
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:16,639	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Can I have this feeling that I am not the boat on the ocean
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:19,199	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Like
EDL	00:56:19,199	00:56:20,991	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The decisions that I make
EDL	00:56:20,991	00:56:22,527	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Are changing other people
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:26,367	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I'm supposed to just I'm about getting slapped with Waze all the time
EDL	00:56:31,231	00:56:33,023	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Pets make me feel
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:39,167	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Purple
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:51,199	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Sarah gray speaking with Radiolab Tracy hunt
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:57,599	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	I think that really is a perfect way to wrap up some of these catch up stories that we've been doing during this
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:57:00,671	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	Episode of Radiolab stories that really have impacted
EDL	00:57:00,671	00:57:03,743	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	The Radiolab crew and you are listeners
EDL	00:57:03,743	00:57:05,791	| rl_extras16itsnotus |	And make sure I'm ready I'm just
