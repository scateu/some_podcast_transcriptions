EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In terms of the idea of the American idea of upward Mobility the bootstraps myth
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Clearly it happens enough
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,687	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So that it persists
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But what what is the case you would make happen enough to make it
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	More likely to be in America than to be in the Philippines or in Argentina or
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Mexico or is there some kind of analysis that says how many people
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Born into a certain
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,143	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Social place
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	End up
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Moving up like how many what percentage of Americans
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Throughout the course of their life
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Actually do better
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Well
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,663	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The way that you measure this generally
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is how many people go from the bottom of the fifth
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Income bracket
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,039	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	To the top
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I'm from America on the average is about
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	7 and a half percent
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That's
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	If you are
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is it really sounds low to me
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It really
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I would imagine it I was hoping for sugar from the bottom to the very top why is that in Canada
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Lights that nearly and in Denmark better and less
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So we decided to look at the numbers of hard numbers
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Denmark is 11.7 it's much better than America is at 13.4 which is
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Roughly double
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You know there's a bunch of countries all across Europe that do better than we do so you know
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	When it comes to the basic measure of upward Mobility
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Not only are we not unique
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Resort at the bottom of the pile when measured against them other countries while you sure yeah
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:20,543	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Crucial thing to remember is that even within the US your chances of moving up there he's
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Subway from one place to another there's a
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Famous researcher named Roth
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Chatty at Stanford
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And he showed that in some regions of the country your chances of moving up
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	A really good the best in the world
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Places like
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	San Jose San Francisco Seattle
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Salt Lake City to San Jose 12.9% San Francisco 12.2 dc11
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Seattle 10.9 saltlake 10.8 when you get to
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Columbus or 9 Atlanta Milwaukee Charlotte Four Points
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	4 in Memphis
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It's closer to 3% this is the percentage
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Of people who are able to sort of move on up
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Yeah it sounds like the bootstraps myth
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,927	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is pretty much not there except if you like born in San Jose
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Place like that
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Yeah so that just shows that
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Your likelihood of moving up
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:19,167	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is based on where you are even more than Who You Are
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Let's listen to more of that story Teddy the worst-performing neighborhood sarkar later
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Did with segregation income inequality
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,431	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Single parent families
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Poor schools and lack of social cohesion
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	These neighborhoods
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Are very often black
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And overlooked when official set budget priorities
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Teddy says that government
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Can effectively begin to Boost mobility
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	By investing in and fixing those neighborhood
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Meanwhile I can do a better job of moving families
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Especially with young kids
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I would have some
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	25% of the Gap Band Yearning between blacks and whites
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is driven simply by the fact that blacks
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Tend to grow up in neighborhoods that are much worse on average
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Cny
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The government already spends more than 20 billion dollars annually
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	On housing vouchers calculated to enable poor families to rent in better areas
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But they can take years
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Even decades
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	To get
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And when they get them Most states allowed landlords to refuse vouchers and they often do
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Sobeys families wind up where they started
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Paying a Savvy slumlord much more for much less
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because there's no place else for them to go
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In 1863
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,831	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The Negro was told that he was free as a result of
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The Emancipation Proclamation being signed by Abraham Lincoln
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He was not given any land
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	To make that
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Freedom meaningful
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Martin Luther King at the National Cathedral in Washington 1968
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It was something like keeping a person in prison for the number of years and
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Suddenly discovering that
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That person is not
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Guilty of the crime for which he was convicted
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Just go up to him and say now you are free
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But you don't give him any bus fare to get to town
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And the irony of it all is that at the
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Same time
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The nation
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Failed to do anything from the Black
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,799	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It was giving away millions of acres of land in the West in the middle
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Which meant that it was willing to undergo that's right persons from Europe with an economic floor but not only did it give the land
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Built
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Land
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Grant colleges
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Teach them how to farm
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,183	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It provided
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Low interest rate so that they could mechanize out forms
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And to this day
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Thousands of these bad persons are receiving
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Millions of dollars in federal subsidies every year not the phone
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	American soil from the vet people
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Tell Negros that they must lift themselves
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	By their own bootstraps
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But it is a cruel jest
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,207	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Say to a bootless man
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That he ought to lift himself
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	By his own bootstraps
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In 2003 the National Bureau of economic research published a famous study
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,895	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In which researchers responded to help wanted ads
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:46,783	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Clerical administrative in customer service jobs in the Chicago Tribune and the Boston Globe
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Applied with names associated with whites like
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Greg or blacks like Jamal
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:56,511	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Based on naming data for babies born in the late 70s
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The white names produced 50% more call back
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:06,495	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	A white name yielded as many more callbacks is an extra eight years of experience on a black resume
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In another study based in New York whites with criminal records
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Got more callbacks than blacks with clean records
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So much for bootstrap

EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:22,623	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Luck is not something you can mention in the presence of self-made men
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Indeed surveys find that
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Wealthy people are far more likely than poor ones to say hard work is what leads to

EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So they're happy lot in life
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Of course hard work and talent matter
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But they offer no guarantee
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Has Robert Frank
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Professor of Economics at Cornell University observes in 6s
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And luck
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Good fortune and the myth of meritocracy
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He said success may also hang on the month or location of your birth not to mention the wealth you're born with
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But when we compose our personal narratives
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,303	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Those things recede into the Mist
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	As Frank found when confronted by Fox News host
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Stuart Varney
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You are lucky
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,079	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That's outrageous
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That is outrageous
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,407	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What about the risk
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You know what risk is involved in Coming To America with absolutely nothing
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You know what risk
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,903	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	With a British accent
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	A total Foreigner you know what
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I do
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,815	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is it luck
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You hold a tenured position
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Yes
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:46,335	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I'm insulted
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,383	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	If you come to America
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	How do you play by the rules
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You work hard
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:57,855	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You get discipline inside yourself
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That's not true
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I got in my cab leaving the studio and of course only then that I
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Think about all of it
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Fat pictures he'd thrown my way that I've completely failed even to swing it but I'm speaking sometime later at New York
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	University
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He said he'd come to the USA with nothing
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He had a degree from the London School of Economics that's that's coming to the US with nothing
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He had
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Somehow overcome the handicap of working in America with a British accent
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Americans love British accents
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He said he took risks
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,351	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What what's a risk I looked it up
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Merriam Webster
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Risk is the possibility that something bad or unpleasant
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Such as an injury or loss what happened
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Who took risks
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Any 6 seater
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Well that means by definition that he was lucky
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	.
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But I didn't have the wit to point that out
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What does it matter pointing it out
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Well as Frank notes
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Several studies suggest
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That when we
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Feel gratitude
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Play more generous to strangers
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,375	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	When were reminded of Lux importance
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	We are more likely to plow some of our own Good Fortune back into the common good
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	We under play lock
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,847	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because we can recall our own
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Struggles far better than the faithful but fuzzy role of chance
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:31,295	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And because the very idea corrodes our face and free will
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But mostly because
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Like Penny Franklin
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,951	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But deeply invested in our own autobiographies
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Take me
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	My parents went broke a couple of times once we had to put all our stuff out on the lawn to be auctioned
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I went to college almost totally on 8th
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But I always knew
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I was going to college
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Even on nights when supper with leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken I brought home from the job
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I knew
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	This was temporary
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So I can say wow I'm really self-made
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But I know I'm not
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Sure
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,135	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I always kind of knew I was lucky
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But not into working on this
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Series
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Did I really begin to understand what that meant
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Hard work is
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Real
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Bootstraps are bunk
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And social Mobility

EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times when I
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So did something
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It just means you lean back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Did you been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:49,535	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart

EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Let me just say that
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What is the most important
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:44,832	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Hearts
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	This whole Enterprise for me
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,440	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Was to let people
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Tell their stories
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Bully as they could
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In their own voice
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And I
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:58,400	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And that was the case was Margaret Smith
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:02,752	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	She started doing with me and end in chat in chapter 4
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Yes can you can you set up
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Set up the conceit
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So we did the myth of bootstraps
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,480	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And this was the myth of the safety-net
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That's what this was about
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And I'm Brooke Gladstone busted America's poverty myths
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	This time it's limited America's social safety net so imperfect still is able to catch p
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	People eating conomic freefall before they slam the pavement but there's no way to confront that
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Without conveying how that
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So prepare yourself for the narrative equivalent of black
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And I talked about
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,504	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	How
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:48,832	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Many many people only have
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,928	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	$1,000 or less in savings
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And that a majority of people
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Would not be able to
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Save themselves from
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	A relatively inexpensive from her point of view
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Short-term emergency
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I'm so what I was trying to do in that episode
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Was to describe the way that people put their lives together
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And how fragile
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Those arrangements are
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And Margaret was an example of that
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,368	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So get ready for that
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Boom Splat I mentioned at the top
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The sound of someone

EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I've been trying to find places
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:21,824	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But everytime I go to the place

EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Back together
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In the house
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Me and my family were victims
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Apocrine
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So why should we
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Lose everything
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because of what someone else
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Created for us
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,752	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It's not fair
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Tell me about you
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:55,616	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	My oldest son
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,920	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That's why I'm he's a diabetic
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	23
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Very good kid
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,040	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He helps me with the children while I work
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	My other son
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Raymond cook
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is the one that was shot he was 17 years old
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Every morning
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	He would
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,816	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Get the kids off the school which is down the street from my house
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,864	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And then he will go to school
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So by him being in the hospital
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I didn't have the kids in daycare
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because I feel like I had enough older kids
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	We can put together
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And make this work
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	So everything is just
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Screwed up
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	My 15-year is my daughter

EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:24,960	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	There's a lifetime limit on cash assistance of 60 months and Margaret had used it all up
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Many years ago when her father died she required long treatment
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	To overcome a suicidal depression
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Later she had diverticulitis
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And she has a mass in her throat surgically removed

EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You never know when it's your time
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Anything can happen
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You might be on top of the world tomorrow but it can end for you to next day
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And you will go through poverty what we going through
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,840	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	James Baldwin once observed
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Anyone who's ever struggled with poverty knows how it's
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	How extremely expensive it is to be poor
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:05,312	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	If you're poor you pay more for public transit
EDL	00:30:05,312	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because you can't afford a monthly pass
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Or you rely on old cars that break down and cost more to fix while paying gas prices that have out
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Run your wages
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You pay more for car insurance because of where you live
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You pay more for rent
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And your place is worth
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	If you're poor you're unlikely to eat healthy meals
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:28,608	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Because healthy food costs an average of $45 more a month
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,656	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Minimum wage
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You can't buy any food cheap
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,264	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Sleep because it cost more in poor neighborhoods
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And without spare cash
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You can't even save by buying in bulk
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:41,920	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You're less likely to have a bank account because of
EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:43,456	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Soaring fees and penalties
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You cash checks at places that take a cut
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You also pay a higher percentage of your income in state and local taxes but no rest of us do
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And so on
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	It's Death By A Thousand Cuts and no way to staunch the bleeding
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	As Baldwin wrote
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	1 feet have simply been placed on the treadmill forever
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:07,776	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Yuan 30 by now and nothing you have done that's helped you to escape
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:08,288	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The track
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What is worse than that
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The nothing you have done
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And as far as you can tell nothing you can do
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Will save
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Your son or your daughter
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Bonita same disaster
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,392	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Possibly coming
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Like I know
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I know that people construct their lives in such a way where there is zero margin for error
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:40,544	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	On some level I think every parent who isn't
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Made of money
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Lives in that state where
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Any moment
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,432	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Drop everything to go deal with a sick kid or whatever
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But this was that
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Ordinary experience
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Taken to a degree that was
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:54,624	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Shocking was truly shocking
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That you could see somebody making it and then suddenly they fall and they fall so hard and so quickly
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	For no other reason than they just got black
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:06,400	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You know from me
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	To hear that
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,264	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	FICA so yes the shooting was
EDL	00:32:11,264	00:32:12,800	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Uninvited and unexpected
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	But
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Then comes the eviction
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	And then comes
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	The refusal to amend
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Or in any way
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Spoon the eviction
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	In the face of what is
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:25,856	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Obviously
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:29,184	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Well that's because people
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Find Lisa saying if there is any police action on your property
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	You have an instant eviction
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	I mean it isn't instant it's 3 weeks and they won't
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Stop it they won't stop at for anybody I've heard this
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,776	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Over and over again that
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:47,872	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Wasn't just because of some recalcitrant landlord
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	That
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	Is
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast17otmbusted |	What goes on every day
