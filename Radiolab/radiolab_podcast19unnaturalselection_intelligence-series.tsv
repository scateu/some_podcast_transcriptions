EDL	00:00:06,912	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:20,992	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Hate this is Radiolab
EDL	00:00:20,992	00:00:21,760	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I'm at Walters
EDL	00:00:22,272	00:00:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And today we have the fifth episode of our mini series
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,208	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	G
EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Last episode we had a story from Google Miller about eugenics
EDL	00:00:34,560	00:00:40,960	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	All about scientists who were applying the darwinian idea that species can be shaped by natural selection
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:41,472	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Too Human
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like instead of waiting for nature to choose which individuals
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Of the human species were most
EDL	00:00:48,384	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A quote-unquote
EDL	00:00:50,688	00:00:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They thought
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They could speed things along
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,272	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And in the process
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,040	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Create like
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:55,808	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A perfect human
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:59,392	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Which I as we got into last time was
EDL	00:00:59,392	00:00:59,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I did after
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And at a certain point Lulu argued that these eugenicist
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:05,536	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In emphasizing
EDL	00:01:05,536	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	There one narrow idea of
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,632	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Perfection over everything else
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:13,728	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They sort of missed the point of Darwin Darwin talks about
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:14,496	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	1
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:19,872	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Sing this one ingredient that he Marvels at he doesn't understand why it's there
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The thing to which we all
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Oh
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Existence on Earth
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Variation
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:26,784	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Variation
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:30,112	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What makes a species resilience
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:30,624	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is differ
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,720	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But that's a very selective reading of Darwin
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:41,632	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Turns out not everyone agrees with her it is true of course that variation is really important to evolution
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But it's variation coupled with selection that actually gives you
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:46,496	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Success so
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know I disagree with
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,312	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Her interpretation
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So not too long after we talked to Lulu
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:54,688	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I I did an interview with a scientist
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Who takes a very different
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Aficionado
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:01,344	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And he's come into a bit of controversy
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,136	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Some people argue
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Betty's
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,672	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Taking those
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Old ideas
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That certain people can decide which humans are fit enough to exist
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And which ones aren't I think it'd be very careful because
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Nobody here is trying to optimize
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:23,616	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	One specific trait or number what we're doing is identifying outcomes that I think most people agree
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Free maybe are not good
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And arguably he's walking those ideas
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:33,600	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Into the future hello
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,136	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Okay to backup a Beat
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Hello
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,184	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Hi is this Steve
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah this is Steve this is Pat
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Hey Pat how are you
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This is
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve Schuh
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I'm a
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Theoretical
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Physicist who also works in computational genomics
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve in his early 50s
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Has short black hair little wire rim glasses
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,104	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And he says he's been interested in genomic
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The power of DNA
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah actually so when I was a kid. I watch too much TV
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,832	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is that right
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:07,648	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah this is 70s there was no parenting going on
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Things were so laissez-faire back then and so when I went home in the afternoon if it's the very favorite
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Thing I would watch
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Was
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,144	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Star Trek the original
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Star Trek with William Shatner as Kirk and Spock
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And in the Star Trek universe in the late 20th century
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Engineered intellect
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How to survive they had these so-called
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,760	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Eugenics Wars
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,088	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In which some genetic Supermen were created
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Check out who is this man
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Bite technology
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What do you want with us
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They were smarter and more capable and they almost took over the Earth and all that was quite Vivid in my mind when I was
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Was growing up and he says
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Elsa made him Wonder
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve like lots of kids growing up in the 1970s had to take an IQ test at some point
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	End
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,176	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	He says he's bored
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Really high
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like in the top 99 percentile
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,552	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Any bathroom self
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Why is that
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Am I getting better vitamins is it cuz my mom and dad
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You don't make me go to bed early at night
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is a city environmental causes that are making me
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Different from my peers or is there something different about my DNA
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Mrs. Pete
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	At one point took this question to his local library I found this whole section where they had book after book
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About studies done on identical twins how they measure IQ or are they measure cognitive ability
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So I just it was
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Very Stark in my mind that something about our DNA
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Could influence
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The power of effectiveness of your brain
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This was
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dope that late 1970s
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And at this point science just
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Wasn't quite ready to tackle those questions in a serious way
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:52,351	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	At that time we had no way to actually directly measure DNA
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And even by the time I was in college
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We had not
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,239	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We're nowhere near being able to sequence a human genome
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Soap Steve went in a different track
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Went to grad school for physics
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Said well I'm going to work on black holes and Quantum field Theory because
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Where are you know we would take a huge technological breakthroughs for us to make
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Progress on these questions
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In my lifetime
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It wouldn't take as long as he thought yes
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Speakers
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	15 years later
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This is when roughly this was
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Mm
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	June 26th
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	2003 back
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Good morning
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The moment we are here to witness was
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Just brought about standing beside podium in the East room of the White House
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	President Bill Clinton announced
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:44,319	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Of the entire human genome
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	More than a thousand researchers across Six Nations
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Have revealed nearly all 3 billion letters
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About miraculous genetic code Eastside come to fruition
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Search Project huge advances in our capability to
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Read out somebody's DNA and along with all these advances Steve watch as the price of a
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:12,735	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Soda for Human Genome was sequenced at a cost of 1 billion dollar
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dramatic
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Today the cost
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Does Pell Grant decrease
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Genomic sequencing
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	$47,000 in a roundabout $1,000 cost of genotyping
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is going to come down here I realized wow
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It is amazing how this rapidly
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	444 is born even conceived ideas about genomics and
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,687	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Genetic engineering will come true
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And if I get to be one of the scientists
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Who makes real
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Some amazing trope
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,183	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	From science fiction that would be the most awesome thing in the world
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Maybe thinking
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I was anyway
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	At me Steve Mister point about Star Trek episode about the Eugenics Wars
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That was his interpreter
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Those thoughts were in my mind when I thought what is it going to take
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,359	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For us to figure out
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The genetic architecture of human intelligence
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,479	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Still around 2011
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve started to Pivot from physics
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Did you know me
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Just hoping to find a portal
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Secular
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Place in the genome
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,463	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That was influencing your say IQ score
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But now
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I'm Diane Sawyer
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Tonight on 60 Minutes
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,119	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Even if team ran into a problem
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You mentioned the human genome in all of the things that it was supposed
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Do
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Ashley
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A lot of people have been this
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Pointed genetics turn out to be way more complicated than a lot of people thought of
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because way things were promised and it hasn't really happened
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It was definitely oversold an initial hope had been like let's find the one gene causes
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Best rate
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And the one mutation that causes
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is that disease
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And I in the early years scientists found a few of those sort of one to one
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Only if you
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Failed to turn up
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know some of the Hidden connections they had expected to find or they turned up stuff but then it couldn't be replicated
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The same within a decade all human diseases would be cured
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,503	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Not too many of them. That was kind of the
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The first
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Face this is Megan molteni I'm a staff writer at wired and explain to us what they found was that
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Became clear that most traits in human beings are caused by a single gene or even a handful of genes
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They often arrive out of the complex interaction of hundreds
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Thousands or even tens of thousands of genes and other bits of DNA working in concert
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So the challenge sort of shipped
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It was about finding a single gene or mutation for any one thing
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About mapping the huge after the genome and looking for variation
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so we realize we need many many more phenotypes
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And much much more data
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How the address that was
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dexter began banding together into these big International Consortium to pool together data and dial up
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Statistical power for everyone 2017
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Public Square 23andMe provides contributions
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Their data into the mix and so by the summer of 2018 they're comparing the DNA of 1.1 million people
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Japanese giant data set that essentially launch
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This next wave
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Genetic study
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yes that is the data set that has been studied to produce predictors
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And that kind of brings us to
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Can I bring the city's genome-wide Association studies
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Explaining these can get pretty complicated but the basic ideas
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But that you have a bunch of talk
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,271	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	People and you want to find out what makes them tall
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Genetically
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So you take the genomes of all the top
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,159	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	People billions and billions letters
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you feed that data in Turkey
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Computer that scans all the buildings flat
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And it looks purple
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like what do these people have in common
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And computer might say like
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A bunch of them have a certain mutation at
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Spot 270 3674
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And a bunch of them also have mutation in spot 920 3672
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And another mutation is about 38000
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I'm just making
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	App
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,623	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve actually did this an hour
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For height and the
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	AI algorithm identified about
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	20000 different
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Locations in your genome
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Determine tight
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	At least informed
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	20000 spots in the genome that have
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,495	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Some influence over how tall you are
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It is
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This is called
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Training docker
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And went to train
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What's its found all of these pattern
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,223	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Once it has figure all that out
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You can men do
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,807	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is prediction
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,343	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For people that have never seen before
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So what you do is you take the Genome of someone knew what we call out of sample data
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This person is not involved in the training and feed
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Gestageno
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This guy have a RB at this location how about at this location how about at this location
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You at 20000 x
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	End of the fing world
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Predict
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This guy's going to be 6 or 2
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Wheaton in how accurate exactly is this thing
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well so we recently just a year-and-a-half ago so
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Succeeded
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Building a predictor which has an accuracy of about
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Plus or minus in
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's pretty amazing
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah and we don't know like what those genetic variations
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Doing we just know that
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:48,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Computer said there's something different happening
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Indonesia
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,143	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Places
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I pray the taller people then for the other
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's correct
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Avere eyes are almost like Black Box
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Does you train them
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And then you got to carefully test them but once
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Once you validate that
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	My God
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The Lord
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Are the Martians just came and gave me this black box which does
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,063	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This thing
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It predicts height
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And not just
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We have a pretty good bone density predictor turns out that's pretty heritable
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Things like
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Diabetes atrial fibrillation
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Breast cancer prostate cancer
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So you can you can do us
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like literally anything
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Again
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Cheney
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So where this gets
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Interesting
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,943	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Perhaps unsurprisingly just in the last
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Years
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,271	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve Hsu starts wanting to
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,087	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Use these genome-wide Association
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Study is
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	As a way to
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Predict
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Intelligence
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Intelligence is a complex
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,303	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Straight so we know there are genes involved
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We know there are lots of them
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But environment so where you grow up even how much you get to eat like all of that matters
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,751	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	2 but decent dozens of studies
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Lockman tenant wins when it comes to intelligence
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:06,943	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Or cognitive ability basically whatever we want to call what an IQ test measures which
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	As we know how is it going to take
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The evidence that we know today suggest that genes are responsible for somewhere between
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	20 to 50% of house market
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Bar or
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How we can house how we can measure
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What we call in Telugu
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so that gives you hope that if you had an update at your AI algorithm
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Figure out
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I had a crudely predict
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Cognate perform
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	From from your genotype alone
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,799	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	No Estes allowed to do that
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The first hurdle community in Renton
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	She was only a fraction of the 1.1 million
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	People
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In the study
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Had
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,039	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Peace Corps data available
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,831	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And without that it would be
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Serving pasta
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,135	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How to predict someone's IQ
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But nearly every Jewish researcher on the planet was collecting
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Educational attorney
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And that's just the number of years that people have been in school they did that is like
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Person that got nice
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	School diploma or a PhD
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I am with Steve and I actually a bunch of other res
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Searchers would eventually figure out
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is that the genetic pattern that predict
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Educational attainment is actually
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Very good at predicting IQ

EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So just put that in
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,911	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Correlation
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	1 means the computer would be able to

EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Let me give it to you this way
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If you admit a bunch of
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,279	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Kids to college
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you have their SAT scores
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You can predict their GPA in college
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:06,495	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And the correlation between those two variables
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is also about point
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Got so we're kind of at that level of capability from

EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,423	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Back to my discussion with Steve Schuh
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:46,335	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So you also have a company yeah actually it's a it's a tech startup with invest
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Stirs Venture funds and
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know wealthy individuals
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What's your company called again
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's called genomic
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Genomic prediction
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Prediction
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you you're starting to apply these things you've discovered to
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Two testing yes by testing for embryos
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	First of all the embryos were talking about here are the ones that were produced through IVF
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	IVF
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Speedo basically pass to baby
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:17,567	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Take a little sperm and egg combine in a Petri dish for later transfer
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So every year about a million babies are born worldwide
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:26,015	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Using IVF a million I didn't realize was that high
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's about a million worldwide
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And that means are actually many millions of embryos produce
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because when you do IVF you often produce
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	More embryos then you end up using
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Which means that oftentimes what IVF couples face
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is a choice
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Which embryos to use and which would be the best to use
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It is now common to do genetic testing on those embryos
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Typically really basic
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The most common thing right now is just a
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	To test to see whether the number of chromosomes is normal to screencast down sin
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Relatively simple test that is by far the most common kind of genetic testing is done
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But now though if you think of the technical breakthroughs that I described to you you can you can screen against
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:09,279	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Much more than just down syndrome
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so the company that we started
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:18,751	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Takes the same standard biopsy that's already used to do the chromosome count screening but takes it a step further and
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And actually sequences a chunk of the Genome of that
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And we can then applied all of the genomic predictors that I described to you
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	To an embryo
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So the doc might say
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Embryo number 4 looks like
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Stephanie can have type 1 diabetes
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Umbria number 3 has a very strange outlier for heart attack
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Etcetera etcetera and applying the information you have about
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Intelligence
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Today's embryos in this decision
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	As well
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So that's the most challenging
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Question that's the one that everybody wants to focus on
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because we can do it
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But you know it whenever journalist contacts me
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Even if the person I know has an unhealthy fixation on IQ and doesn't want to talk about all the help
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Positive health things
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Associated with this technology
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Just wants to focus on the one thing that
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know everybody gets heated up about the end
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But yeah I still want to have the conversation because Society needs to understand what is actually going on
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Our current policy
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And we arrived this after really a lot of
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Thought
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,079	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And not wanting
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	To get out ahead
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Of where Society is on this
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The only thing that we report
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About the intelligence of
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The individual embryo
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is if the embryo is an outlier
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In risk for
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I think the medical term is
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Takacs what is it is it a mental disability
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Something like that
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I think it's
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,911	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Intellectual disability intellectual disability
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And that
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The predictor would be
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,543	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Saying that it's likely that this embryo would have a
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And IQ score below a certain number yes I think intellectual disabilities
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Probably something like IQ of 75 or something like this and
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It would mean that
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,831	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The IVF physician will get a report
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Saying
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,695	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Embryo number four has a very unusual
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Large number
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Of the variance
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Depress
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Intelligence
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And I think that's a reasonable thing to want to know
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is there a parallel track happening in your mind
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because the other
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:32,383	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	People who had gotten excited about making super people besides the science fiction people are like
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The Nazis
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know the idea that you would
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dehumanize some people because they're less able
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is extremely dangerous
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But this notion that all we shouldn't do any of this research because there was a guy called Adolf Hitler
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's kind of crazy
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:53,887	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Tumi
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We every technology really powerful technology weathers AI or genomics or nuclear energy
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They have
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Risks it's always the case
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Sure but I
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I guess I don't trust the IQ part of it like
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Pretty well-established that I
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:19,232	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The IQ score isn't a good way to determine intellectual disability like I think it's way
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Be more complicated than that
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:25,376	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Right but keeping my none of this is a sure thing in the sense that we're not saying
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That we know
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Embryo three
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Will have IQ below 75 we're not saying that
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Purchasing the chances
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The child
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We'll have a lot of difficulty
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Modern society
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,968	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That probabilities elevated
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I guess I this is me where we disagree is that like I don't I'm not convinced you can know
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What's the quality of someone's life is going to be like based on
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And I cute
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We're talking buddy that what you saying that conditional on that
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Score
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If I go out in the population I look at people with that score
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,424	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A lot of them have not
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Had
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Very
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know I think positive lives
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:06,336	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And I'm pretty sure that most mothers when they're pregnant
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,616	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	When they go to sleep at night
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They're not dreaming about that outcome their dream about another outcome for their children it just feels like
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,552	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Bad idea
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The only question here is
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Imagine that you are
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,184	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Sister is going through IVF
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you happen to have the genotypes of all the embryos of your sisters
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Potential kids
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you find out who a embryo for is predicted
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	To be
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In less than the 1st percentile
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For cognitive ability
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But all the other ones are in the normal range or maybe even above-average
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:41,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Would you tell your sister
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I mean that's the basic
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Question right
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Who anyway we're going to make some kind of brutal decision like okay these two we implant
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Those 8 we donate to science
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:56,512	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah right so it was going to happen anyway
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	2/8 of their 10 embryos
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Right so
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The thing is
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If we can help your sister with little bit
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Let's Help
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's my attitude
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Ind2
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I also want to emphasize that typically the embryologist will actually just look at the shape
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:18,016	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Mike did the cells grow in a nice symmetrical pattern they just literally look at the shape of it and say like
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That one looks nice yeah with your sister rather
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Go with the gut
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Feeling based on the shape
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Or would you rather go with
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Some genetic evaluation
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well I don't
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I don't know because
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's probably really hard for parents to know like
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:39,008	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The really interpret that information they might just hear 75 and then here
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You probably intellectually disabled I don't want that
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And I think
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That freak me out
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yeah I do think the
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We need really good genetic counseling
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So the people understand the world that we're entering into
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because again no one's saying that embryo for is going to have IQ below 75
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's extremely bad that that's actually not the message
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:04,608	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The message is that the risks are a lot higher than for all your other embryos
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's always
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:13,056	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But as for what a lot higher really means I mean there's different ways of quantifying
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The strength of the prediction
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The way to interpret it
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is it's a good
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Predictor
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	On average and that's what makes it useful
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In research
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,880	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I talked to this guy named Dan Benjamin
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,928	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But in general
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,488	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's not a good predictor at the end of each what level
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	He's a professor of economics
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	At USC and one of the founders of that big Consortium of scientist social science genetics associate
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Consortium that help pull together the million or so genomes that Steve's genetic IQ predictor is effect
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If we built on
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And he says
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Think about that comparison Steve made to the SAT
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:54,016	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know it's very hard to predict who's going to do while in college
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And SAT scores are
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:58,880	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Among the better predictors of that like
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	On average
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The kids who score well on the SAT
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Will do well in school but I mean if you look at a
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	University
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You boys seen your grade point average yet there are going to be some pretty poor performers
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you might ask yourself
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:21,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Why did the squirrel admit those students shouldn't they have been able to tell
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,456	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Go students
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We're going to do
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Praying and the answer is they couldn't tell
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For any individual person SAT scores
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Are not
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A good predictor
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	There are just too many
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Other things that
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:38,816	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Matter
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And justice
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Shift away from the sat back to like
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Using a polygenic score to try to say something about an individual
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If you had to
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:48,032	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Quantify
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	What not a very good production meet how did you do that
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well if you pics two people
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Randomly
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:56,992	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In the sample
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And you asked
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How likely is it that
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The one with
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,648	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The higher polygenic score
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Is actually the one who
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	.
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	More
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Years of schooling
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The answer is
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,352	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About 60%
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	60%
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yes there is a 40% chance
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That you'll get it backwards
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And more to the point
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know in the context
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,848	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Embryo selection
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:26,432	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The prediction is most likely to be right it's going to be something like
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Reducing it from 60% to 55
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So according to Dan these predictions can be useful in large groups
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But on an individual level
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They're just a little bit better than a coin toss
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I worry that companies that are offering a service
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Exaggerating
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The potential gains
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And also
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Are not being
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,192	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Upfront
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	About what the risks are
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Two things on that real quick
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,824	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	First dances
EDL	00:26:54,336	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Because we don't really know how the genetic variations that predict IQ score really work
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,248	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If you select against them
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You might accidentally be selecting for others
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like mental illnesses or certain diseases are are these risks and we don't even know what all of the risks are
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Number two
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Which might even be bored disturbing
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:19,168	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dance has the genetic data all of this is based on
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Came only from white people of European descent
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I think they can get their hands on
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:28,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Consequently if you try to use at a test like Steve shoes
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I'm someone who's not a white person of European descent
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It pretty much doesn't work
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That correlation
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Drops to the floor
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So even the possibility of doing it is pretty much limited to
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well off
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	White people at this point
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Insulin Steve
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Thrift stores with this comp
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That the genetic predictor is pretty much like the SAT
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	That's just not the whole story
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	For complicated
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And what worries me is that you know you have
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Guys like
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Dan Benjamin
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Advocating for this
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You no more
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Complex understanding of what
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Statics really mean
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You're saying they're being funded groups
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They're not meaningful and individuals
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You on the other side you have
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve story
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Which is
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's just so
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:23,936	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A straightforward and compelling and you know it's Steve story and dance story
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Happy face off
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I just feel like
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve's will win every time
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Story of Stow
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Simple it does feel like
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In the end what you're able to tell someone
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Like isn't that much because it is in a one-to-one predictor or even really
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Close to that
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Well it will get better
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I guarantee you as we get more data the predictive power will get much better I think it will eventually
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Achieve a kind of
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Capability kind of like what we can do with height
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Where are you you know that the error is about
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:57,472	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I need a maybe plus or minus 10 points of IQ
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,264	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know I will say that
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Mega miltank
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Right now while he may
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Be an outlier
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,688	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	In terms of what he's willing
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	To offer based on kind of where the models are now I don't think he will be an outlier
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Furlong
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Information is going to become available and it's
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Only going to it's only going to get better
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And of course there are many ethical
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,840	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Things that we have to
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It's sort out and I think different societies will decide different things about
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	How they want to deal with this
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,472	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,264	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You know if a particular country
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Said
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,848	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We do not want you to ever
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,360	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Report
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Anything about
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Cognitive risks we just don't want you to report that
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:40,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I would totally respect that
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	But then I think you have to read
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Respect
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,112	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If the nation of Singapore
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,928	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	If they decide this is an important thing to do
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,720	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Will you better respect them too
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,768	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Otherwise you're some kind of racist
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Colonialist guy who says only my ethics
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Count
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,472	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So I realized I eat I realize the NPR audience may not like it but
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:04,288	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	This is the world that we're entering into
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Have people used to act like has the
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Predicted tool been used by
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Consumers yet
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	So
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	They're different

EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,904	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Along those lines I'd probably have to check with RCU
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:04,192	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	When I staying just the other day as we were finishing the story
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Steve roach rosson said that while the company has provided brisk reports

EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Yet
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And at the end of this
EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:27,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I find myself thinking about
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	The thousands of couples out there who are doing IVF
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	And the thousand more who will do it in the years and decades ahead
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:42,080	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Honestly wondering like
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I would love to use any name they want to know
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:54,624	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Cycle early stages of IVF cycle 1
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You can tell them
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	A really hard question
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Feel uncomfortable
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,584	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I think I would have a lot of anxiety over that.
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,376	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	You sure that is
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:06,144	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Not that act
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Brilliant

EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I don't see what harm
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	We would need to ask
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	Before we would ever
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:28,416	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I would probably want to know you want to know but then you're looking at a world where
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	People who have a lot of money

EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:44,032	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	It is something I think we will test for before we do our next round he's probably will do
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast19unnaturalselection_intelligence-series |	I don't think about it long and hard
