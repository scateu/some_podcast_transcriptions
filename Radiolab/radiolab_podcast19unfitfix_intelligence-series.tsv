EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,943	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Darkside attempts to measure the human mind and fit people into boxes and
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Reaches out into the present-day in ways I honestly never expect
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And also
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Because the story of how we got the buck V Bell
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Is all tangled up in the history of the IQ test that we got into an ER first episode
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It begins with this guy who sort of moons over all of it

EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Walked around London with a pen in his pocket and a piece of paper
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Quantifying the number of women that he found her attractive
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	On the left side of his pocket and that's in the Box full story and on the right side Fifi women that he did not find it
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Attracted to get a statistical measure
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	IOffer tracking
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Everything kind of crazy thing is that he was related
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	To Charles Darwin cousins and publishes his Opus on the origin of
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,343	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Species
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Princeton picks up his cousin

EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And I could completely shut him
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And his idea was that this mysterious Falls of natural selection which seems to kind of invisible
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Naturally
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Sheep creatures into their most perfect
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Formed
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Man could harness this
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And do the work of nature
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Faster
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Better
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Because through his measuring the statistics his research cotton had become convinced that it wasn't just
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Unilec

EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Almost certain all those things
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Could be inherited
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And not just physical and mental but moral characteristics and traits could be inherited
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	If you could measure everything is good measure these human qualities
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Then you could read people just like you bread animals bring out the ones you don't

EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And as a result her foster parents sent her to the Central Virginia Training Center which in those days was called the

EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,111	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And so
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Pretty was on the hunt
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For the case

EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It linked to the blood
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So he found her

EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The number on the bottom
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Okay this is not a
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	We're not going to be the first one to do this okay that's white because to us we feel weird about it you know what I mean it's just
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,400	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	You're not the first one
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Exactly I don't think people understand this type you know these type of people they're difficult
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Okay
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Basically the answer is a
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Resounding yes
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,280	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Needs to be done
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,304	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It's common
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Don't worry about it I even
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Concern but what if people know with my neighbor's no no
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,960	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	No it's sealed
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And get everything
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Okay alright well thank you so much okay alright bye bye now
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:48,992	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Get the guy
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Really quick a couple of things first of all to be fair to her
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It is not officially her job to judge whether or not so much to be sterilized it's her job to get that
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Question to judge
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And second of all there is a legal difference
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Between sterilizing someone for eugenic purpose
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For the good of
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,912	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Society
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Like there's something wrong with them that may
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:13,312	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	He passed down to the Next Generation and threaten the race
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Versus sterilizing someone for their own
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Quote unquote best interest
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And there actually are a number of states today that allow
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For a parent or Guardian to have their disabled child sterilized
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For medical purposes
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Even if that person doesn't give
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Cuz if they have a child they might die, thing
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah and some of the laws even talk about that person's inability to adequately care for a child
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,472	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Do you think the woman who is
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Responding to mark
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:49,408	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Sing oh yeah we've done this before with that kind of case in mind or with more Eugenics beef-flavored case in mind
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Honestly I don't I don't know I was able to find her but she said she couldn't comment on this
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Case for the story
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,088	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And numbers
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	How frequently sterilizations are done
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Are really hard to find
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But what is clear is that at the
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Time of that call the lies It Was Written In the book
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	One of the reasons why a judge could approve of a sterilization
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,960	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Procedure is and I quote
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That the individual is mentally impaired and that such defect
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Genetic nature that it's likely to be passed on to any children
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Which is just
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Pure eugenic
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Reasoning
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Right so it's
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:29,088	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The general welfare what's in the best interest of
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Society not about what's in the person's best interests
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And so I found a disturbed
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So he was
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Horrified
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:39,584	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And I wanted to put the nail in the coffin. He also this was kind of his like
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Hero Genesis moment is a press release
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Wanted to pick a fight
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The Christian lost his considering suing West Virginia Etc universe
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Eugenics forced sterilization law
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,944	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The Charleston
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Gazette pick it up
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And his idea was
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,040	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I was really hoping
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	State
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Wood
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Innocence defendant that we can together
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Get it before this
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Supreme Court said hey
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Overturn this
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So his dream was like
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I'm going to reach out to West Virginia and say let's do this thing and you defend the law
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And then we'll get it the Supreme Court has his legal strategy was
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,520	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Suet
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Make them up to something and just going to work its way up
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But right after the article came out before the legislature and they just unanimously refill this
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	How fast did that happen with notified about a couple months after
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:38,976	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Immediately
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:43,840	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Overturned because they were like we're West Virginia we don't want to be seen as up
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Holding
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Eugenic sterilization
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The great for the people of West Virginia
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But Mark's bigger plan to overturn Buck V Bell
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Spoiled and so
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	He starts thinking all right if I can't

EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,504	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I reach back into the past

EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So she said no
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And ironically all that time her job at the colony

EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And they gave
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:05,472	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	You should give her a math
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:10,336	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I wish she thinks was ether and she felt the world slipping away and she was like
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	She figured she was being euthanized
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:23,904	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I woke up and did you know when you woke up when it happened

EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Listen to them tell their stories about how they were taken from their families and in what happened here
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,488	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And you know
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:02,560	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	If he goes down to the Virginia State Assembly General Assembly
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Bring them rexana with him she remembers it
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:06,656	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So what

EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	He wants a bill
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,336	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	To get some type of compensation
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	4 victims who were forcibly sterile
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:23,808	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	To go down to the Virginia state government and he makes this appeal he says Virginia was where the first supreme court sanctions there
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:24,832	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Elevation happen
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Virginia should be the first
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,136	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	To compensate
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Victims
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And they basically pass

EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So frustrating about this was that he didn't really have the support of like

EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And they say they're sorry
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:50,848	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And then a couple years later Virginia passes it but then Virginia only gives $25,000 which

EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,880	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Downs me the most is like
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:49,024	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The way that you're Genesis talk it's always about the good of society saving the race saving the nation
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,608	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Obsession with the future and with perfection a master race
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:54,144	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	They say that it's
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Science
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:37:01,056	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That if you just look if you read Darwin and you apply his principles this is how we make a better race
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,664	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But the thing that like they all
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Somehow happened to miss
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	In On the Origin of Species
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Is
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	How
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Frequently
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Darwin talks about 1
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Sing this one ingredient
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That he marveled that he doesn't understand why it's there
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But it is the thing to which we all
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Oh
EDL	00:37:26,656	00:37:29,216	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Our existence on Earth what is that one ingredient
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Variation
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,080	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Variation
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,384	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It is the engine
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:41,504	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Of natural selection of of beings being created more perfectly it when it is what
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	You know when a gene pool is
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:49,440	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Two homogeneous it's weaker and so the Genesis by breeding out
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,464	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Variation
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:53,280	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	We're in a way for oiling their very own plot
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:55,328	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Building a master race
EDL	00:37:55,328	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:57,632	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Like who gets to say what we need
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	You know
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,704	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Does the humidity built into it
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The theory of nature
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Selection
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yes it is immediately
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:07,360	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Immediately distorted with social Darwinism
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:08,640	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Rightly but we decide
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:11,456	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Exactly and I think that often times
EDL	00:38:11,968	00:38:15,040	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The story seems like it's past tense like it's over
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:16,832	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But that hubris is
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Still
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	In our laws today I mean I talked earlier about those laws which are
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Supposedly different from the eugenic sterilization laws
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The laws
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Where you're allowed to stare like someone in their best interest
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Does
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Statutes are so controversial
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:36,544	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	As Paul Lombardo explains when you really dig down into the language these laws are still saying
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:39,616	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	There are sometimes when we should be making the decision
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,640	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For someone else
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,432	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	About whether or not
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	They should have children
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:48,832	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I think your inclination is correct there are reports of abuse and there certainly are opportunities
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,112	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	For abuse in this case
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	These are powers of the state which we should
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:56,256	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Which way should be incredibly
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Suspicious of
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:10,336	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Hey this is Pat I did I just want to jump in quick
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:10,848	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I have
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Personal this destroys so intense
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:19,296	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But I guess I just kind of one question at the end of that about that last thing you're talking about Lulu
EDL	00:39:19,296	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	So so they're these
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:24,160	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	These laws that are different
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:25,184	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The new eugenics
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Sterilization laws bat
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I guess still allow for
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Involuntary sterilization like
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Buy a parent or Guardian
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:39,264	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I guess I just wanted like to have you heard of that
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah I know I talked to parents I talked to parents
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Do parents actually who are struggling with this
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Right now
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:51,552	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Are you talk to a mom who has a son with severe disabilities and
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Approaching adulthood
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I'm she's like watching him
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:57,952	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Piano grow into a man's body with men
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Desires and thinking about sex
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And she's like worried that he would
EDL	00:40:04,096	00:40:05,120	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Get someone pregnant
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Beyond wearing that like
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	She doesn't think there'd be any way he'd be able to care for a kid
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:15,616	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I'm so in her mind she has entertain the thought like would he
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Audrey be able to live a freer life
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:24,064	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	If you could have sex and have romantic relationships without the worry
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Of getting
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,880	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Somebody pregnant
EDL	00:40:26,880	00:40:27,392	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah widget that is just like a
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	An impossibly
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,536	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Difficult place to
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Sitting as a parent
EDL	00:40:35,328	00:40:36,096	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah I think
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:38,144	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That there are
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Parents family members grappling with this question in a really private
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,776	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Hardway like
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:45,824	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Is there some wine
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:49,664	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Where someone is so severely disabled they should not be allowed to
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:50,176	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Kids
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Okay so no type of situations
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:41:00,416	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	This is Ivan Nova Smith the historian and disabilities Advocate we heard from before
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	When I talked to her about this she says that when it comes to looking for that line
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I think it's really dangerous
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Cuz that line moves
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And so

EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:18,592	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	I get what you're saying that the needs to be aligned and needs to be
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:19,360	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Some point
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,384	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	But
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	At the same time
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	My fear in

EDL	00:41:31,392	00:41:35,488	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	The policy is in a politics in the couch deciding where that line is a
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Parent Guardian someone appointed by the
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	All of that is scary for us I guess for the disability community
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	It's scary to talk about the line because
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	That means we have to leave somebody out
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:52,384	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Ivanova says if she had been born in a different time or even

EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:25,151	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Because the the orphanage was never able to teach me in my native language
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And I'm living the word from you weren't speaking

EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Difficult because she put that she had a very visible disability
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Does she be sitting there in her chair moving her body back and forth

EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And she was terrified
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,383	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Dilaudid my prayers

EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,391	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And she had started to believe that I agree
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,951	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	She worried about all these things
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:45,023	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Yeah like I wouldn't like I would forget to feed them

EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:57,055	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	And worse than that I don't understand other people's emotions
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	SOI
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Mascara that I would not have that nurturing
EDL	00:44:01,407	00:44:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Feeling like she look at the baby and just filled

EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19unfitfix_intelligence-series |	Until she came out of me
