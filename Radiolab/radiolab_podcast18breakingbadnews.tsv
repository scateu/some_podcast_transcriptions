EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Very upsetting in ways I couldn't totally articulated a time I was like you need to be more
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Aware
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Someone's house
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Taking their food
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He jumps up he grabs is tearing that he uses to punish his cat
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And I ran outside
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And I started shaking it
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I wouldn't even take a video of it
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And then Sandy his fast is like
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	By the house will sing like a dog
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A mic
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Although the Bertolli freaked out it
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Booked it
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Back into the woods that way they walk up to the Peachtree and Peachtree has been
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like Matic
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The parts of the tree that are
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	60 below
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We're pretty much
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Stripped
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Peaches are there just always Peach pits and like half-eaten peaches got it around and every one of those is like a
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Repeat that they're not going to have like a pie crumble they're not going to have the feeling that
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:47,679	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Just
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Los
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Nnn's
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,847	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Determination I was like no
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I can't
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I don't want this to keep happening at this point
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	See
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The pieces that are left
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And I would like them to be hours
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I think the bear has had his fill
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And this has to stop now so
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	They go back inside
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And Rob immediately Google's like how to deter bears
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And then at some point they come across a website that says
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The one thing that bears are very afraid of is
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Human voices
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,887	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah so I was like
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Pink
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:21,471	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The what I need to do is make a giant
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Play with the pots
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And play it
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A podcast
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah and so he takes
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This old iPhone with a broken screen and
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He then begins to build the
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Spare deterring
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Podcast

EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	At
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Scaring away
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A bear

EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	PJ's laugh
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Imagining a bear that was like

EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know that your bear tutoring machine is doing its job it was an instinctual choice
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:13,504	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I felt like continually revealed itself to be the right one

EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	From the bear encounter at the bear
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Had eaten about 40 peaches
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Space on the bucket cleaning up the
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:55,744	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The mess
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,560	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	How many peaches the bear had taken from him the way it should

EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I got we got about as many pieces
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,168	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He thinks it

EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And so anyway
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The end of writing this entire story on Twitter
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,320	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The story of how was happening in my yard right now
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It got a
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Big response and I was a little surprised
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,208	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I think that the number of
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	People who took the Bears
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Height
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But I was like that's the problem I can't the bear have some
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Not up to you just for you like
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:36,960	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bear apologists
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Do they understand that there are there's food sources
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Been the one Peachtree and Rob dubbins yard
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like clearly not know
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The way I see it is like
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	If Rob had domesticated the Bear Race it to only understand that food gave her metri and then sent it out of the woods there
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But other than that that's ridiculous
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I'm not taking
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The morality of it
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The bear doesn't like
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Reply off
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Rockets
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Do you think on any level the bear
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Got something out of listening to the show
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Now

EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:22,272	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But I think it was in 2014 that
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:25,856	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	She was on Facebook I saw a post about this bear and he was
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	In a
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Video walking by
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And I was like oh my God this is so sad like you want me to think it was like
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Funnier
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Now I thought it was sad
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Why does the video make her sad
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Accuworx animal rescue and she's rather than being like just
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wow for her when she wants a video
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	What she saw was a bear that was
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Injured
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:54,528	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So the thing is that if you look at some screenshots of petals close up you'll see if she
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Really had no hands
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	One was like amputated
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like I stabbed it was like pretty much missing and the other one was
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Just broken
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Mangled
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	At least that that's why he walk on his hind legs
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:11,680	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I mean I'm sure he ate whatever berries or whatever he could get
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:16,544	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because he couldn't use his paws is why he was walking around these neighborhoods
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,592	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because he was starving and he couldn't feed himself
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:21,152	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Her first thought was we have to help this bear
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	She gets in touch with a couple women they start a GoFundMe campaign helps a pedals raise $25,000 in my
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:30,624	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	4 days
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	To basically Dart him transport them and house them at this place called The Wildlife orphanage there's a couple other why
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wild bears there a couple of Pam like retired

EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know it's not a zoo
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So
EDL	00:33:46,496	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The best thing to do with petition
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The state of New Jersey to Justina Lake
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Do it cuz that's against the law for us to just start a bear and

EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We have no interest in commenting on this
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	White why would they not even comment well I think you can understand that
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,272	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	If
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,064	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know the rest of the story
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Has a lot more
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:34,112	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Story
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That you don't know
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,952	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Alright let's hear the rest then
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Okay what's up what you basically have if you have a collision of two ideas
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	About black bears
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And what they are and what they need
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So that's John welham magazine
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I knew more about it earlier works like before he got famous
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He's written a lot about animals including pedals and explain to us that what you had was this device
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,248	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Where
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	On the one side you have people like Lisa
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,624	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	When they looked at the bear they thought
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's injured struggling
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We gotta get out there
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,256	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	On the other side
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Do you have the state of New Jersey
EDL	00:35:13,792	00:35:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Came out it from a completely different
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	View point where they
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,728	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know we're just as interested in
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Calling code helping the bear and making sure the
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The Berrics
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Livid
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,968	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I don't know best life I supposed to say
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:36,320	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But they wanted to go by in a very different way as far as they were concerned it wasn't it was a wild animal
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:40,416	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And you don't take a wild animal out of the Wild
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Unless absolutely necessary fact that you saw this bear walking on two legs
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There is a real Survivor
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:51,680	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This is like a feet of evolution like this pair of all
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	To survive we should just let him do his thing
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Davis still out there being a bear
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's the right thing to do
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So this is
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This is the part of the story
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	About pedals that we
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:04,736	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We haven't told you yet
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,784	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:09,856	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Petals was first found in 2014 first showed up
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Shut up again the next summer and then yeah even early 2016 their videos of pedals and then nothing
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And then a bear that has become a national sensation is
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:22,400	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is Dad the bear known as pedals
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So in October of 2016
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:27,008	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	News broke that pedals
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,032	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Batman killed
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:32,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Turn the bear hunt on Monday
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A place in New Jersey
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A familiar story played out
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This morning over the apparent killing of a
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,832	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The fame blackbear

EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	People posted photos of his home his wife's name and in the midst of all this
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I think everybody out there should

EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Pedals the bear
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	One reason why I find conversations by animal so interesting is because
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Animals always have no comment
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Right there

EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Spend some time on all fours
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Had been distinguishable from an ordinary bear
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Whether he's been standing upright in the wilderness looking for posterous

EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There's never clear what we owed pedals exactly
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,184	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You could argue that allowing pedals to live in the woods
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Be hunted like any other bear with an act of respect
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,792	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Validation of his wildness
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You could also argue that it was a gruesome lapse of human compassion
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Pedal stood for something we may never agree what it was

EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,056	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Times when a kid did something
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:51,104	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Well
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:55,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Maybe it was the moment that I

EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know maybe this is the moment when I should admit that
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:55,615	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Everybody broke repair
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:59,711	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I can see that coming
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know and you woke up in the morning full of them figuring excitement would you do the hard news or would you right away
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:08,159	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	What you do the bad news
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like what I was hoping actually and I mean immediately Molly Simons had a little bit
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like the hurricane you just come in but I was really hoping was it somebody was going to get us
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Solid Rock Solid breaking news about bear
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Kind of thing and I actually had one in my sights that I was just sitting on waiting to see if anybody got it so
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:33,247	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Something that the Trump Administration did though most people to know actually the seeds of it were planted during the Obama Administration wasn't
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:33,759	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The grizzly bears
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:40,671	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Came off endangered list it and in the wake of that there was about to be for the first time in almost 50 years
EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A hunt around Yellowstone
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because the Grizzlies have gone from like you know whatever it was a hundred left
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	2 now around 700
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	They've also started encroaching on
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Makers campers hunters and Ranchers
EDL	00:43:54,495	00:44:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	These are the ideas that once you do list them which should be a success say they came back we can do list them now but also the same time that means that
EDL	00:44:00,895	00:44:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We can start
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:02,431	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Column
EDL	00:44:02,431	00:44:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Mechoulam yasso the ranchers are geared up to get their licenses and head out there and have this hun
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And at the last moment there was a court case and a judge said no no not time to do the Hun
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And that happened a couple weeks ago and then that just at hunting season he's before the hunt or whatever it was I guess
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	What is the reason from the judge
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I think clearly like some activists if they're not yet ready this will damaged
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The population in so yeah the judge had kind of like that maybe that the administration hadn't shown
EDL	00:44:31,871	00:44:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Enough recovery to Warren
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Hunting
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And but that then just two days ago that of that ruling got to have like either confirmed her upheld or whatever it is and now that
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Functionally actually means that the grizzly is not
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Dlisted
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That it is still on the endangered species list and there's even some amongst
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bear
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Turn Folk
EDL	00:44:51,327	00:44:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You talk to you then they're not
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Quite sure what to think because
EDL	00:44:54,655	00:44:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	If you're going to have an endangered species list you need to occasionally have
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	An animal come off of it
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Hey need to win to win otherwise you just lose the political will to even
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah totally do it or you or you just
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Show the doing it is pointless
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You're going to lose them eventually sold on you never get off right now you need someone to get off and I guess
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know you can probably go back and forth for a lot about whether it's
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,159	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Time for the
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yellowstone Grizzlies to be off or not but
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,255	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah so nobody got
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That but but don't we have one more
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	On story and it comes from
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Annie McEwen and lots of knots
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Verses about bears
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:34,847	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Some ways both really is another
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:38,431	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Using the sense that it's recent but it's breaking news in that we're staying stuff
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That is true about the world that has not been reported before
EDL	00:45:41,759	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So it's
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Breaking news about bears
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:49,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah I think so okay where do you start

EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Look for in the app
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:13,151	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Afternoon following the court in court to a cabin
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There was a hill
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And I could see some traffic coming down
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Down to the cabin
EDL	00:47:19,295	00:47:20,831	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Fresh Bear Tracks around this
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:25,951	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	They're coming back
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:27,743	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And that's the approach if they see that this
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:29,279	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Cabin is also been Rancid
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The bear has gone in
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He broke the window
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Okay well we'll continue on
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So this is a third cabin they pass wow
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The door open
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Made a message say is it normal for a polar bear to go into cabins and throw mattresses at

EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Start tracking it again huacachina cop Holloway
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:47:57,183	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And at this point they start getting a little worried
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:59,999	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because these tracks coming toward the community

EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I noticed you're not open
EDL	00:48:13,823	00:48:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Too close to the cabin this is this presumably the next
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:22,015	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Destination for the bear
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Sure enough
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is bear was Heidi

EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Feeling better
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,575	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is differin
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Something is off
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,135	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I took a shot at
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I hit it
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,743	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	He kills the bear

EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	They approached it on their schedules they get off

EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:11,167	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Looks
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Strange
EDL	00:49:13,215	00:49:15,775	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's a blonde bear
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Once you catch a grizzly bear before and that was my first time
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:30,367	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Amber Lakes are dark. Boots and socks or whatever
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:30,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Circles around
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:37,791	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wow interesting so he takes it back to town and he checked in with this government officer
EDL	00:49:38,815	00:49:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Can I take a look at it and he's like David
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I think this might not be a polar bear
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Might not be a great leap
EDL	00:49:45,215	00:49:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It might be a hybrid
EDL	00:49:46,495	00:49:48,031	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Hybrid bear
EDL	00:49:48,031	00:49:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah like a little bit of both little bit of both
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And David had never even heard of that before I have never actually heard of that it's not a common thing to happen
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But a few years before David the bear
EDL	00:49:58,783	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Extremely rare
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Creature shot and killed in the Canadian Arctic first one ever was caught in the wild
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:09,023	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grizzly polar bear hybrid media
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	David Attenborough included
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bound passenger
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Got really excited
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So we've known for a while that it's happening out there and even David has encountered a few more
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Out there in the wild
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Two little teddy bear cubs
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	For sale hybrid
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:31,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So cute this is some kind of crossbreeding between these two species
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:32,575	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:38,975	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The crazy twist was when when this guy David Katana shot this thing at
EDL	00:50:38,975	00:50:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This particular pizzly Berry sent it off for genetic testing
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's called the first
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Second generation bear
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:47,423	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The mother was
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Polar bear half grizzly
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And a father with a for Boost
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This Bear That David shot
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is the first indication that
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	These bears are fertile
EDL	00:50:59,455	00:51:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Which is something that you wouldn't think if a horse and a donkey
EDL	00:51:02,783	00:51:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Say what
EDL	00:51:04,319	00:51:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Together making me all those mules can't then have Offspring I thought that two different speakers
EDL	00:51:10,719	00:51:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Different species
EDL	00:51:13,023	00:51:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The branch off evolutionarily like hundreds of thousand
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:20,959	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Pretty much the same time that we broke off from the Neanderthals and so be like us
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Meeting a neanderthal

EDL	00:51:29,919	00:51:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Creating a specific it sounds like you had
EDL	00:51:35,295	00:51:41,439	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Franklin Ave April 10th call me
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wait wait
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Do they branch
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Instead of the police and The great leap branches
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:48,863	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	At the same time is left in the neanderthal
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Are around of a ballpark I mean all these are ranges so okay
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:56,287	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	I thought that's not
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That doesn't work
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:51:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	What it kind of
EDL	00:51:59,871	00:52:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Shouldn't work
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But Wildlife manager Marshall Brannigan says
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:07,551	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Sorted does I'm kind of against the bylaws
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Terminology that we use for
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Breaking the rules
EDL	00:52:12,671	00:52:13,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But neither
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grizzly bear
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Has been growing over the last few years
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Mission in action
EDL	00:52:21,375	00:52:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grolar bear might not be considered a rare creature
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	For too long of general idea about this whole new species
EDL	00:52:27,775	00:52:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is it linked to the changing climate
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:34,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because now these two species are overlapping
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Canada's grizzly bears North Wild
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Polar Bears are losing much of their eyes
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:39,551	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Spennymoor
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Thailand
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Polar bears
EDL	00:52:42,111	00:52:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Have
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Hair covering the bottom of their feet
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grizzly bears do not but it pads
EDL	00:52:47,743	00:52:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Fit knee pads
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Has like partial hair
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Recovering
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Feel like maybe you get the best of both worlds you know grip or whatever but also your your warm
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So it's a good thing to be one of these half hybrid Vigor Best of Both Worlds
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This is the new bear in town
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah
EDL	00:53:15,135	00:53:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The may become increasingly common
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That's kind of like a necessary we got interested in and that's the story
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That has been reported
EDL	00:53:28,191	00:53:31,263	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But then last year this paper came out and it
EDL	00:53:31,263	00:53:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Kind of completely changes the story
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And are we at the place where the where the the bears become breaking news
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This is even more interesting than that first
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:46,111	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's way way weirder
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It could more dramatically play out like on an HBO miniseries
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Lay it on me
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So last year a paper came out and it's signed if we talk to you Marcia Branigan is one of his co-authors
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:54:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It is a basically made a big giant list of every
EDL	00:54:00,703	00:54:02,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Sighting of a hybrid bear
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:07,103	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And of all the genetic analysis to like every time we've seen this happen in The Wire
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And all the information we could possibly glean from that
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And what you found was it every single one of these hybrids can be traced back
EDL	00:54:16,063	00:54:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	21 female
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Polar bear
EDL	00:54:19,135	00:54:20,927	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	One single bear
EDL	00:54:21,695	00:54:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Really
EDL	00:54:22,975	00:54:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Names
EDL	00:54:23,743	00:54:25,791	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bear 1096
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	0
EDL	00:54:31,679	00:54:35,519	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is she is she is literally the mother of all hybrid
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wow so there's something about this polar bear that seem to attract Grizzly gentleman
EDL	00:54:41,407	00:54:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Or she was just interested in Grizzly gentleman
EDL	00:54:45,247	00:54:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	We mostly just have kind of guesses of how it went
EDL	00:54:47,807	00:54:51,391	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Down since there were no Witnesses this is Elisa McCall she's
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:52,927	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Staff scientist at polar bears internet
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:54,207	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But we think
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:55,231	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Could have happened
EDL	00:54:55,231	00:55:01,631	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is that there was a female polar bear and maybe she did have some you know interesting personal preference for brown bears or May
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Maybe it was simply that
EDL	00:55:02,911	00:55:03,935	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	She was an estrus
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And a Milky Way There
EDL	00:55:06,751	00:55:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So she's giving off a scent that she wants to mate okay they leave the stinky butt
EDL	00:55:11,871	00:55:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Trails and so males will follow them on the ice what are those smell like
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:21,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Oh my gosh do you know I've never smelled that but I know to a male polar bear they smell good that's all I know
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:23,647	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But as the female put downs
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	McNally Footprints the males are like
EDL	00:55:25,439	00:55:31,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Oh yeah and they'll follow her for you know days and it's cute though actually put their feet right in
EDL	00:55:31,071	00:55:35,167	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Footprints yeah so maybe there was just
EDL	00:55:35,679	00:55:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This really aggressive brown bear grizzly bear mail
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:40,543	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	2
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:42,079	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Follow the female track
EDL	00:55:42,079	00:55:44,639	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	XM could have fought off other
EDL	00:55:44,639	00:55:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Polar bear male maybe this is a case of of like
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Consensual but if you look at sort of like the genetic analysis it looks like animated with tutu
EDL	00:55:54,367	00:55:56,415	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grizzly bear she had babies with
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Two different grizzly bears
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:56:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And with one of them she had babies
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:04,095	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Years apart oh so she's had three letters with with
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This was two different grizzly bear
EDL	00:56:05,887	00:56:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Interesting
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Singer from the
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	3 non hybrid bear
EDL	00:56:09,727	00:56:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So this is narrowing
EDL	00:56:11,775	00:56:15,871	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Scope really quickly
EDL	00:56:15,871	00:56:19,967	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah just like species why'd you know new adaptation
EDL	00:56:19,967	00:56:20,735	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's just like
EDL	00:56:20,735	00:56:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There's this one lady who has this one king
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Strange Place Savannah
EDL	00:56:29,951	00:56:36,351	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Those were just the only dudes around I was thinking like oh my God maybe this bear is a genius
EDL	00:56:36,351	00:56:42,751	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Things like ice change around her and you think I need to save my DNA and the best way to do is to put it
EDL	00:56:42,751	00:56:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	With a grizzly
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is there doing better than I am that's hilarious I mean
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:48,383	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah I imagine that
EDL	00:56:48,895	00:56:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bears
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The hybrids are kind of a mess to be honest they were really well suited for land or for ice they were such an in-between bear
EDL	00:56:59,391	00:57:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That they really just weren't that
EDL	00:57:02,207	00:57:04,767	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Grizzly bears are so well adapted
EDL	00:57:05,279	00:57:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	To life on land and finding food got the big hump they've got the big whitehead they've got these long
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Claws for digging they don't have fur on the pads of their feets they don't need it polar bears are
EDL	00:57:15,519	00:57:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So well adapted for the ice they've got a much
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:24,479	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Smoother Sneakerhead that helps him get in and out of seal hole they've got thicker sharper claws to grab seals and help them walk
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:26,527	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Their fur is
EDL	00:57:26,527	00:57:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Halo eye which helps trap warm air against their body is in the hybrid
EDL	00:57:31,647	00:57:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	They're like this weird in-between so their head is kind of like
EDL	00:57:34,719	00:57:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Not really sleep but not really boxy kind of this weird in between They Don't Really blend in that while with the ice
EDL	00:57:39,839	00:57:42,655	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Soar with the land cuz they're kind of this creamy color
EDL	00:57:42,655	00:57:46,751	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And then there for itself is depending on where the Furs on the body
EDL	00:57:46,751	00:57:48,543	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is like a mix of
EDL	00:57:48,543	00:57:50,335	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Halo but not Halo like
EDL	00:57:50,335	00:57:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So yeah it backfired on
EDL	00:57:52,383	00:57:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Nerf that was her
EDL	00:57:53,919	00:57:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is Marathon hot
EDL	00:57:55,455	00:57:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But I like that idea don't these pizzly bears are just
EDL	00:57:58,527	00:57:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Probably not
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The new
EDL	00:58:01,087	00:58:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Horizon of the bear that will
EDL	00:58:03,647	00:58:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Accident
EDL	00:58:05,439	00:58:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Top of that
EDL	00:58:06,207	00:58:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So okay so it if you're Imagining the family tree right so there's a mama polar bear
EDL	00:58:10,815	00:58:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	With these two grizzly bears at different times write a letter to Dad in the stepdad
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	One of the kids
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	A daughter
EDL	00:58:19,007	00:58:20,799	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And she's the only one who's had kids
EDL	00:58:22,591	00:58:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And came from her
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:26,431	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	But it turns out that all those third-generation Bears including the
EDL	00:58:26,431	00:58:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Bear the David
EDL	00:58:27,199	00:58:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Katana shot
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	That bear the
EDL	00:58:30,783	00:58:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	The daughter bear she mated with her father
EDL	00:58:33,343	00:58:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wait
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:35,391	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There's some sort of incest
EDL	00:58:35,903	00:58:36,415	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Parts of the eye
EDL	00:58:38,463	00:58:43,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Let's so weird
EDL	00:58:43,071	00:58:45,375	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Kind of like dated the stepdad sort of thing
EDL	00:58:45,375	00:58:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yes or no
EDL	00:58:46,655	00:58:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah she slept with the same two dudes with her mom.
EDL	00:58:49,727	00:58:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Oh my God
EDL	00:58:50,495	00:58:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Gosh now we're going from HBO to like
EDL	00:58:53,823	00:58:54,591	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Shakespeare
EDL	00:58:54,591	00:58:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Yeah I like Greek
EDL	00:58:56,383	00:59:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Tragedy years now all the sudden it looks less like a species wide
EDL	00:59:02,783	00:59:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Movement for life will find a way
EDL	00:59:04,575	00:59:06,879	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And it looks a little more like this is one crazy intro
EDL	00:59:08,927	00:59:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Wow
EDL	00:59:09,695	00:59:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	So what do you make of that
EDL	00:59:10,975	00:59:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Maybe this one like crazy inbred family is the
EDL	00:59:14,303	00:59:15,071	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	First
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:16,607	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	You know quite awkward attempt
EDL	00:59:17,631	00:59:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	What may become like
EDL	00:59:19,423	00:59:25,823	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Might be like Evolution driving forward making shaky step up their shaky status
EDL	00:59:25,823	00:59:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	It's not like pretty the way you expected it to Ranchi because sex
EDL	00:59:29,919	00:59:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Like like
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Animals try things
EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Flights
EDL	00:59:34,271	00:59:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	This could maybe this is going to keep going but but
EDL	00:59:38,111	00:59:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Only time will tell
EDL	00:59:39,135	00:59:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	There's no way for us to know
EDL	00:59:50,911	00:59:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	And one last thing which is
EDL	00:59:52,959	00:59:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Kind of an ass
EDL	00:59:53,727	00:59:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Afterthoughts but but maybe not
EDL	00:59:55,519	00:59:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Because while it's not
EDL	00:59:57,311	01:00:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Clearweather are polar bear family is is an awkward evolutionary step forward
EDL	01:00:02,687	01:00:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Or just
EDL	01:00:03,967	01:00:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Freaky
EDL	01:00:04,991	01:00:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	At what we do know
EDL	01:00:06,783	01:00:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Is that nature is not

EDL	01:00:36,479	01:00:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18breakingbadnews |	Just made it all that more uncomfortable
