EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The periodic table
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,272	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I never heard of the periodic table
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In the last year
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:28,832	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And when one day his wife

EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I told she was using it as a term of abuse
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The cable many many times

EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When describing something he felt was bad or dangerous
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,032	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Without
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What I meant by that
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Appraised
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I guess like what was it like to be a very important person in the very important circles
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,248	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But have this Gap
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well I'll tell you what I became good at bluffing
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I was on the board of
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Number of Mining Company
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I hope none of my colleagues
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	From those companies a listening
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:10,560	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Part of being on the board met yet read all these geologist reports
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,864	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Intelligence reports
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then we would have board
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Discussions about a lisp
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I would sit there striking my chin in the way I hoped would look like a wise
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Jeff
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But I didn't really have a clue what people were talking about that you didn't have
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This is where it all began of course
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I come from Zimbabwe and I went to school there
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It was a boarding school the kind of school where you eat wear uniforms you play cricket
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And for some reason if
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Extra clever
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Instead of sitting any signs at all you said he Greek
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Greek Couture
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So it's not as they did me a huge amount of favor
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,872	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So he'd always thought soon as I have time
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,968	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's what I'm doing now I'm studying science
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For the first time the age of 71
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And he's really going for it he's got a tutor for 3 hours a week
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Studying physics
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Biology and
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The favourite
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,280	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I have been really absorbed by Kem
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I guess you are married
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To a scientist is that
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Crab I am case of what is is that influencing your studies at all or
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:27,360	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The Desert Sun point I would put this right coupled with another agreement that she would be a very helpful
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,432	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Shoot it to me it was indeed she's proving to be
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But I think there's a danger now that she's going to rather wish this she'd never encouraged me to do this cuz I
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I know I never stop singing while have you noticed this
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Something it was Polly the periodic table
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When I first discovered
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I couldn't believe how elegant it was how come
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Preston beautifully defined it or was
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But I am
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Very very devoted to it the end you have a copy of it close by most of the day
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,528	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Very committed this is amazing then there are other things
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Principle of electricity and how it lights up bulbs and how it then moves on in
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Casual around the house
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Who comes out at the other end and

EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like this little curly hair and she must have straightened with a flat iron
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:08,959	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then she put one ponytail holder and then another ponytail holder
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The kind of look like a water ox
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Rihanna says
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Leslie did something that just sort of
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,175	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Struck her she started like
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gritting your teeth scrunching her face
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Squeezing our hands I just walked
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dog is making me so mad
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm going to punch it it's so cute you know she's like it's so cute you just want to smash it
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I want to punch you make me so mad at me
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And Oriana was just sitting there watching the show and she was like wow that's a strange reaction like Leslie saw this
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just wanted to kick it in the ass
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which might seem odd
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:59,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But is Oriana kept thinking about this moment she was like
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah we do this we do this sort of thing all the time I do that I totally do that sign out Ariana's new
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When I see my baby
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Steve's like little body
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	My joints tense up in my hands my fingers start to curl
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	MIT start declensions
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I just need to eat his face and I need to figure out what's going on here this sort of like a feeling with cuteness
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What is it that we're doing and why do we do that
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Back in 2011 orellana set out to answer those questions
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And the conventional thinking of the time was that you know if this is there is an aggressive expression like gritting teeth
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A clenched fist
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or wanting to
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Squeeze something must be representing some sort of
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Aggression
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Underneath that there's a little bit of violence
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You want to hurt
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That thing yes
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sure makes sense to me because I think my first thought is we were all cannibals at some point and I'd there
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There's something in there coming through
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I'm in and it's not good in flights
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Society in that
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is just
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The urge
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sneaking out
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In some way
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	No I think it's a
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Work is work is continued
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For the last six years on this and I've found a lot I've understood a lot now about
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,151	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What these Expressions communicate
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And what they represent
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So when Oriana first started researching this
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	One of the things she said figure out was
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When we see something
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do we actually want to squeeze
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or is this just a
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Russian
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Figure of speech I want to squeeze you
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	She started doing these experiments where she would bring people into the lab and she would show them these pictures like a little baby duck
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A little baby fluffy puppy and then give them bubble wrap
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's like really quiet Hall and throughout the entire semester
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You could hear papapapapapapapa and for the really cute pics like baby
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ducklings you sure that's like they was just being ringing out she's above a rat that I identify with that
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I was like bubble wrap would not cut it for me so Oriana was like okay
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It looks like there's real aggression here but
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I made it this isn't that much of a shocker
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	At the same time
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There's actually nothing negative going on inside the
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	These people they were actually full of joy and happiness while they were
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Turn bubble wrap
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's not about
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:40,159	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	An actual latent aggression we're just we're just sort of
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Expressing it this way but we don't mean it
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That we're aggressive at all
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But that's so
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Strange to have this sort of
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Weird
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Schism where you're at
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Happy on the inside but aggressive on the outside
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's actually not as weird as you would
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	No no Briana pointed out that in some ways it's so, and we don't even notice it
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Happens all the time you see athletes for sports fans looks like absolute
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Fury
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Punching the air screaming or weeping
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When something great happens
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And that's another thing
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Think about you know
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tears of joy you see brides and nuc
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Lottery winners
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You see people weeping at the off nature
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Double complete rainbow think about all the times when
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What happens on the outside the disk
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Play
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Doesn't match
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What's going on on the inside
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I saw it but I still feel like I'm at why why would you want to punch the cute puppy
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We put the rainbow started to look at all this stuff
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:03,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And having tested everything that I can think of everything that's in the literature there is a through-line to what these Express
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Represent and communicate
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So according to Oriana
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When you see tears like all kinds of Tears
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Weather for winning the medal for looking at the beautiful sunset it's the same as tears at a funeral
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Greece communicate
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wanting to stop
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wanting to be
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Still
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wanting to pause
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And Oriana said that when it comes to these like Expressions cuz you know
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Now you see a cute puppy or you scored a goal or you act
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Actually want to fight somebody
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's about wanting to
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Go
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wanting to move
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wanting to approach wanting to get close to
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's about
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Moving forward or momentum
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's funny cuz I like when I
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	See my baby at 4 in the morning when he
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cat that wants to nurse
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm exhaust
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's but it's not until like ice

EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Get on going
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pause moments

EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's definitely it is
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's a listener of those care behaviors
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	EXO
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just nice to know that in situations where like we may not know what's going on we may not be able

EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Simple set of

EDL	00:16:56,575	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Page where any question at all might be legitimate
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How did you land Upon This Way
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So one of my friends my hair

EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is breaking out a story that was going to involve Samson yes and so I want to know a little bit about
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How did you meet Samson
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I got Samson in 25
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In 2015
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This weird thing happened we're all of a sudden I became obsessed
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	With just wanting a dog
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	All of a sudden all I could do was
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Browse
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	These dog adoption websites in the DC area so there was like a lot of like
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know going to shelters and going to rescue groups in
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Finally this rescue group that I think she's been in contact with email turned said
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Want to come meet Samson and I clicked on his profile and he was really really adorable beagle mix
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They had this a cute video on YouTube are you
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Jumping around and he looks so happy and he's cramping in a field playing with other dogs
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And the profile didn't really say much about him just said that he was a little shy he was a stray and South Carolina
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so I arranged to
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know go meet him up
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Adoption event
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When my partner and I go to the event
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We find Samson and
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He is just as cute in person
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Except we noticed that he's
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Super super
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,159	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Scared
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:38,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where he's like shaking and
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He can't even stand on his own and the people at the adoption event at the house
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,095	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The flap
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So I don't know maybe that should have been a red flag for
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Who knows.
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:51,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For me I was like I don't like
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Keep that going to come out
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So I'm going to be the one to bring him out of his shell
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Samson was living with The Fosters
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Family and they wanted to do a home visit
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So if I still came over with Samson to my apartment my little basement apartment in DC
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And we gon this walk a little exploratory walk around the neighborhood
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And while they're walking we passed by a man who is black and he's wearing a sweatshirt
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Scanza Foster turns to me and goes
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He doesn't like men in hoodies
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So cat is thinking
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I'm thinking it was you sent me this
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Are you saying that he's scared of guys in hoodies or are you saying that he's afraid of
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black men
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Right
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Samson was also afraid of me
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tell Philly badly wanted a dog and Samson seemed
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know just like
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like he needed me
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I don't know maybe this is
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Patronizing
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Human
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Adopt a dog think I don't know I don't know and so I decided my partner and I decided to adopt him
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We loved him so much and we love him we love him
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Present tense
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:10,111	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cat her partner take sanzen-in and almost
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Immediately
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cat would have a friend over who is black-market her friends who are brown
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For a long time that he especially did not like what if I create an American friend when they would go outside
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He just was afraid of anybody who was an American or you know like
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Let them out but then it became this
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Clarify just one thing
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You yourself are not white
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I am I am Asian American and Chinese Americans you think that's maybe because you said he was afraid of you at first
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do you think that he maybe was afraid of you because you weren't like
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I don't know he is so at he did like my partner more and my partner is white
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In MCAT did put Santa in training in butt
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That didn't seem to work so she was just left looking at this adorable little dog that she just taking in thinking
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is he racist
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I should be quick
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This is like a question that a lot of people have
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know you know what's going on
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:17,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This is not the first time I've heard like this morning my mom called me
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This idea that dogs can be racist is racist
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Chose all the time he's going to get really aggressive towards people with darker color skin
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Huffington Post in Psychology today and actually what parks and
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Jacksonville dog owners have you ever heard of this idea that a dog can like you're racist and they're a bunch of people who were like I have
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:50,720	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Totally wants long time ago you know I heard stories about
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Play somebody there like he doesn't like a white girl dogs that maybe didn't like white women you be bottom and just black women
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black men I guess all this is just a long ways that this is definitely you know
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So my question is
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is it actually a thing now I'm rolling so this is going to be kind of
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A fun conversation about race
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,000	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Can I sat down with this woman sure
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,560	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sure I'm Alexandra Horowitz I
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:32,704	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Study at the dog cognition lab and Barnard does research and dogs think about dogs. Dogs all things dogs
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,240	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So go to jump in Cattails Alexandra
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That how she is taking Sampson in
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Barca seems to be
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ina races
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But like you know is that even possible I don't know can a dog be
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Recess
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	She was like
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Obviously
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dogs aren't racist
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The way humans are racist
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I mean racism is rooted in our history the history of our country and how we've dealt with different
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:02,400	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Groups of people
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But dogs do not know about that
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What the dog knows about comes
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,288	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	From
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Its own life
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That dog's own life
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:16,224	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ancira talking through what dogs can do
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We ended up having this conversation
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:19,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	About
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The most basic elements of being a racist
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Erase it erase it anything about it
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know step one is just
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Putting people in these different groups in your head
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Can dogs
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Remember types of
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People or just well I do think the dogs are sensitive to new things and differences
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:47,200	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And one thing that Alexander told us that she's seen in her work is that dogs do seem to play differently with diff
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:51,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Different breeds for instance they play better with ones that kind of look
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:57,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like them wait so dogs have a bye at the good they are purchased for there on time
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They do and partly might be because they have the same kind of equipment the same length tail the same time
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ear shape the same body size
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So they understand each other's cues a little better might just be easier but that's what I'm saying is dogs notice difference
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Census in the world
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And when it come to noticing differences between people
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:22,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There's some at least anecdotal evidence that dogs can see can tell men and women apart
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:25,088	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They can't see differences in skin color
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Right cuz I are dogs colorblind solutely can see
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:31,232	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Color differences
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What is the world look like to a dog
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Best approximation is that there's probably seeing something like the color spectrum when it's
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dusk and feels like yellow
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sense of worth in oranges
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Have disappeared or have been muted
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay so the dog can see color yeah so it seems like it's possible that maybe dogs can tell the difference between skin
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But then the next question is
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:55,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Can a dog
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:55,808	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Then
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Make associations you know like light-skinned people like this and dark-skinned people are like this
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then carry that forward and all this other interactions whenever it meets another person
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like that person
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ingroup bias
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And can it do that with dark-skinned people in question
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's okay I actually did this
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Did us-34 code-switch okay
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's rainy and afraid of that she
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	She found 20 Mori
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Laurie Santos she is another dog cognition expert except this time she's at Yale
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Call and I'm like
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Hi I think my dog is ready
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,584	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And she comes to the same thing as Alexandra
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I think the word racist has a lot and it you know the history of race in America and all these
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But in her work
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,520	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	She has been trying to answer
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This is very basic
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Can a dog show preferences for certain racial groups the Lorry designed a study a dog
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dog version of a very famous human study known as an IAT which is the implicit association test
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I don't think I've ever heard of this test
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:10,048	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I don't know what it is okay so the implicit association test that is put up my heart rate right so basically that test
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You can take it online it kind of feels like a computer game where you get these words and have to sort whether they are positive
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dave or negative
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then you're also getting faces
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like to speak to the people and you have to sort weather Bay AR
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black or white
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:30,016	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Basically they're kind of test to see if you would like associate certain groups of people with certain kind of negative or positive
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Images of thought
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,832	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tracks yes yes
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How on Earth would you give this to a dog
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:38,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I think our dog is here right now so we can
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:44,608	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Lori found with implicit bias research similar kinds of Studies have been done with human babies
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He's just to see if they have racial preferences and since their babies
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They can't use computers with words
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Researchers use photos photos of different human faces
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Adidas for dogs
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Lori had this Pit Bull mix named Vader come in and what she does is she
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Bring the dog into this little room
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And they have a dog sit
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:12,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I live near the center of the room where there is a reason
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And she
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Hatha Spa
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And it kind of reminds me of like a little Puppet Theater
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,264	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's open on one side
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,616	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And you can slide in different images
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	At the front that the dog will see
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So the research assistant gets his box ready
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Life in a picture
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gold office cover to show Vader a picture of a black person
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,768	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just a straight face
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:46,304	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah kind of headshot
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:51,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They said the same picture to Vader over and over
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Over again
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You seem straight face
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black person
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But then
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The researcher shows Vader this picture of a
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Smiling
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Happy looking German Shepherd
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black person
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Smiling German Shepherd
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's all very randomized
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,168	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So sometimes it is
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Black person black person then smiling dog
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The boy
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:38,016	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What is it that they're looking for here they only showed black faces and happy dogs
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And you don't
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When data comes it again the Lively show him other kinds of combinations
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	White faces angry dogs
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Angry dogs and then if you know
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So on
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:53,376	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And what they're looking for and in this is the same thing they're looking for when they
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Did the test on babies
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is to see whether the dog is attentive and focused
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or bored and unfocused
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Basically how is the dog reacting to
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	These two different pictures being put together
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,736	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The way Lori but it was
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:12,064	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know if a dog shows like a pro white bias then
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They should find the categories of white faces look happy dogs easier to process
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And therefore more boring
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So they might like Look Away more or
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They might not be able to stay focused boredom implies that that dog might have a preference for white people
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But then if they see a black face a happy dog and they stay really focused on it and they're not bored
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:36,640	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That could possibly mean that maybe they're surprised that these two things go together
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And maybe that's evidence of a little bit of prejudice
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So so what is Lori learned
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Will Dad here it is
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The big news
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:50,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And it's too soon to tell it's still too early to tell
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah I mean we're really at such an early stages it's really hard to say I guess one thing we have learned is that
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:03,264	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Are so many people are interested in the results of the study your people really want to know the answer to the question of how dogs
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,032	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	CDC categories
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And that's been really compelling just to realize
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How fascinated people are with this question
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How often do you get the is my dog racist question
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:19,392	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Shure again Alexandra Horowitz you know because we see dogs as mirrors of ourselves
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Our dog
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Books as mirrors of ourselves
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They are
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:27,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Because regardless of what a dog
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Can see or not see
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:31,936	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or whether they associate negative feelings with
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Different faces
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The one thing that dogs are very very good at
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:39,872	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And in this is something that both Lori and Alexandra made a plaintiff
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,432	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Paying attention to us
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,736	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And more specifically
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,528	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How we behave
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For instance remember this idea that thoughts and tell men and women apart well she was like
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:59,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Probably has nothing to do with what men and women look like but instead it's how we behave men and women.
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Deal with dogs a little bit different
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:02,656	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	On the whole
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You should bring treats
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:12,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Women are more effusive
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	More likely to talk to dogs
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:20,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In a higher pitch voice women might be more likely to crouch down
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:24,928	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To a dog instead of kind of coming right up to a dog so these are obviously generalizations
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I think a dog is very sensitive to
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Does behavioral differences in Alexandria says the person who dogs are the most sensitive to
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Who sponsored their King the closest amount of attention to
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:39,008	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is you
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You the guardian
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,848	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You the owner
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,616	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We have
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,944	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To be sensitive
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When we feel
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tents
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:52,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I wonder if
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know I suspected this thing
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:56,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Became dislike
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sort of funny but not really funny thing that I always wondered
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And somehow convey
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Confirmed it or made it happen to spy
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just the anxiety of
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh my gosh is my dog actually
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is he racist
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:13,312	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well so if for instance and I don't want to
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,848	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Put behaviors in your
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I don't want to say you're doing something or not but if you tense up
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When you see your dog's going to have a reaction
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To somebody
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And your Dogs Unleashed sure they're at some level in your control
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Then the dog will feed off of that
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:33,024	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cat do you think that that's something you do do you think that your
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That you have almost as pre reaction
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To Samson's reaction that might sell Samson to react
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:43,264	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Nothing no I don't know
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Could be a situation where
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,640	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This has become such a running joke among
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,664	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Our friends you know
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:51,456	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That are friends who
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You know many of our friends are people of color they come over and they're already like all this
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This finds like this stupid.
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This dog
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,648	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You going to bark at me he might bite
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:01,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I don't want to touch him really yeah I do
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so maybe that like
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,792	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Maybe a host of things reinforce to Sampson
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I may be cancerous
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But like there is a potential that
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I have created this world
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	My dog
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:17,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Now sees the construct of race through me
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,640	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just because I have taught them to him through my
EDL	00:33:20,640	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like that all nonverbal cues of
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A lot
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:25,504	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Esta
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	If only we could talk to dogs
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,088	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Understand
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	If you had 5 minutes apart not going to make it harder if you had
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	2 1/2 minutes to talk to Sampson what am I
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What questions would be so hard to do but
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:45,728	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like I would want to know about his history but that would obviously take up way too much time cuz I feel like
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Being a southern boy he would have like a really hard time
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:52,128	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So I think I would just spend those two and a half minutes being like
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,408	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You are such a
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:58,528	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Acute dog everybody in general regardless of race I don't even know if you can tell the difference between
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People they would love you
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:00,832	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He loves attention so much and you know like when he does get settled into a situation he can be such a
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,744	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A cute and I like
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,792	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Devour he always wants at some scratches
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:12,864	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sam said if you were this nice

EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:17,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And you just didn't let fear dominate you
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People would love you so much
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Watch
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I know I wish I could give him that pep talk
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I wish someone would give me that
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Good boy okay

EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:33,248	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ruffle here Raphael Kroger
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I read for Harper's magazine
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:38,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Has had a long-standing question when it was answered
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	By a German scientist
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Highest gross
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In that scientific paper he just
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:44,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:45,792	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This began for
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,584	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The author of the paper must
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The same way that it began for me it was an idle curiosity
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:50,656	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Paucity
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He was
EDL	00:35:51,680	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Raising
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	3 kids
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He would take them to the park
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Their children and families around
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:00,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But there was also
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Assertive
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:01,920	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Crisis level
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,200	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dog poop
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He sees people letting their dogs
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Poop
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just walk away
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And he starts to wonder
EDL	00:36:13,184	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How can you
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:14,976	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just leave.
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,328	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How can you
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do something so
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:23,424	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So specifically antisocial
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	As leaving
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Feces
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,752	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	On the sidewalk
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:29,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What's with these people
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:31,360	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What's what's going on in people's heads
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,408	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	On the way to work in the morning
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,736	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He would
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:39,040	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Follow people at a certain distance
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Without talking to them and take notes
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You have to study there in front of you I have the sitting in front of me
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:46,976	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I quote
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Neighbors watch
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:50,048	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Poop falling out of the dog
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:50,816	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What it means
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:56,960	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Poop in public huge pile of excrement on the ground and on the way back I'll go owners look away from their poop
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:59,520	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In the afternoon he does
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The same thing through the medium of poop
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The earlier science
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:08,224	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I had my God the fact that those previous studies
EDL	00:37:08,224	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Great
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:11,552	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In the previous studies on this
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:12,064	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Russia size
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The typical distinction is between people who pick up
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The poop and
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:18,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People who
EDL	00:37:18,208	00:37:18,720	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just leave the
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wet
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:23,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Babe categorized as
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Responsible and irresponsible
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dog owners
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:27,680	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:31,264	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	After he's observed these people for a while
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You start to recognize
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But there was
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Something more complicated
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Intriguing
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,968	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Battle going on
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:43,552	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The 101 of the behaviors he observes
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:44,320	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:48,160	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People bagging the poop going to that trouble and then just leaving
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,952	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Scooping the poop up
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,744	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Putting it into an envelope
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Plastic envelope
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,304	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then they
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,584	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Don't throw it away yes
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:57,376	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People will bagging the Bandit
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sometimes right next to
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Garbage cans that are not overflowing
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:05,056	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	D'Amore
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,080	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Intriguing
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Version he observes his people baguette
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:10,688	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then display it
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:13,504	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Prominent Place sometimes hung on a fence
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:14,784	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sometimes
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Hanging in bushes are ship trees
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:19,136	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Switches be actual vernacular term
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:24,512	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah actually my favorite mysterious example and got the paper points to
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Hanging the bags

EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Maybe you bagged
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,696	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The poop to begin with
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's because someone's watching you you want to be

EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:00,608	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	00:39:00,608	00:39:02,144	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Then later
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It switches
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:03,680	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	2

EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so leaving the poop returns humans to Nature in a way
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,112	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Humans can no longer
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Run around
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pooping freely in the wilderness
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:27,232	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The dog
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Becomes a kind of proxy
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,304	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Through which this
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Aggressive mischievous
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,400	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Atavistic desire can be played out
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So I want to drop my pants and just poop on the street but my dog does it
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Good for me
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Something like that yes
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:45,664	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is that mean
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:50,016	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When you see a man or woman with a dog who poops on the street
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:51,552	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You should be getting those cheat just pooped
EDL	00:39:52,064	00:39:52,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:54,368	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:56,416	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	At the very least
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	If you decide to get into it and
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,256	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tell somebody pick up your poop
EDL	00:40:01,024	00:40:04,352	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The U is ambiguous
EDL	00:40:47,616	00:40:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Weird
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm honestly speechless by that
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,712	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Robert I did Nazi that coming
EDL	00:40:52,224	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well I will just walked in and an end
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And left it there for us
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then it was picked up by
EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:02,976	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Adler who
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Back and put it
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:06,048	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	On display
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:11,168	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	As sometimes happens of course it's time introduced
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,448	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I guess
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,472	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Time to take
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,008	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yes but you got to take a break
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:17,568	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We're back a few more questions

EDL	00:41:47,776	00:41:52,895	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:41:52,895	00:41:55,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments

EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:03,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How did they do that
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:11,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To you
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their music
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or maybe the kids in math class you notice their writing used
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Taking the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:30,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It doesn't have anything to do with it

EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Comes from producer Pat Walters hello Emily are you there
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm here
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:10,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Alright a few months ago I called this
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tree sign
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:15,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	My test and Emily Burns and I'm the science director with save the Redwoods League
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I have so many questions about trees for you
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But I really just had one
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:22,751	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So I I read this
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:26,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A little tiny article in the spring I think
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which artifact in it that really shocked me
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:30,175	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ian the fact
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Was
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:33,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That redwood trees have
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:34,271	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	12 *
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	As much
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	DNA as humans
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is that true well it looks like it is turning out to be at eight times bigger than the human genome
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay. So 12 is closed a little overestimated name is not a reliable source
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But the idea that like these trees would have so much more DNA than I
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just kind of like
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:57,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Twisted my brain up in 7 different ways
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's pretty crazy
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:44:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cuz you usually think of genes that means something to do with complexity exactly so if your Mozart
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:10,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh you're a Tall Tree like who's going to have the most genes
EDL	00:44:12,415	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Don't like what is all that extra DNA even doing well I'm not a geneticist
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Forest conservation
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	One thing Emily was able to tell me
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:25,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is that I was missing the forest for the trees
EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:28,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So to speak and why is that
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well family told me that Chris Treadwell it does have a very large genome there are
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tons of things that have way more DNA than us
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:36,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Anime bowling
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:38,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You just got a new.
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:41,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like a rundown
EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	An onion has five times as much
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:51,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	An onion apus salamanders with 40 times as much
EDL	00:44:51,839	00:44:58,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Let's hear things like lungfish has a cockroach red meat Lobster
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:04,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I love to just lies in the bottom of a cold seeing bolt at the top of the list arguably the
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:06,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Prison with the most DNA in the world
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:09,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	With 50 times more DNA than a human
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:13,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is a tiny not so remarkable looking
EDL	00:45:13,599	00:45:14,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Little Japanese
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:16,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Flower that's deeply strange
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:22,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's puzzling by the way is biologist Ryan Gregory professor at the University of Guelph
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In Canada and my area of study is why certain salamanders have 40 times more DNA
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:29,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Then you and I do
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:34,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Am I told me like no one knows exactly why that's the case
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:38,431	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well that's why I still have a job is because this is something we're trying to figure out what
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:39,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	According to Ryan
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Here's what we do now
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:47,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So in your genome and I I say yours and I mean that in a mine too I'm not going to single you out take the human genome
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Your genome is about
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:50,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	1 1/2 to 2% jeans
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Only about 1 to 2% of your DNA is involved in making the stuff that makes
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Up you
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:00,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's the stuff we called jeans
EDL	00:46:00,191	00:46:06,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Now there's another couple percent that we now think are there to turn those jeans on and off switch
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:11,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is important but the vast majority of your DNA is accumulated
EDL	00:46:12,223	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Detritus could be a gene that sort of mutates into grades and no longer works in might be random
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:21,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Redundant copies of other DNA example of might be
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:27,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	80 80 80 80 a million times
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:29,119	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Became essentially stock
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:35,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In the genome and so now they're passed on from parent to offspring but the key thing is that all these little random bits of
EDL	00:46:35,519	00:46:36,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	DNA
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:39,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Turn a hanging around there not really doing anything
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:44,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which princess is how you can end up with a huge genome even though you're just a
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:48,063	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The tree or frog or a worm or even single cell
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:52,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's right but if they're not doing anything to help me why well
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:55,487	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They would be doing things to help themselves
EDL	00:46:55,487	00:46:56,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Help them
EDL	00:46:56,255	00:46:57,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sounds a bit like
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:58,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You think about
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:00,095	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The bacteria in your gut
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Most of them are probably just
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:07,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There because you're a nice warm bag of nutrients that is a great place to live if you're bacterium
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That would be kind of the same sort of thing that might be happening in the genome which is
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,151	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But they're not like
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:14,687	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Alive
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:17,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Really right like there
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where are they
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well I don't I don't know I think it depends a lot on your definition of a live so I mean are viruses alive
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:27,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That that's a philosophical question that
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is pretty difficult
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:31,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But the shift that you have to
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:32,095	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Kind of make
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,423	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And thinking about the genome is less that its it's
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:39,263	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's basically the recipe for making you or the blueprint for
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:42,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A human or any of those kinds of things and think of it
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:45,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Almost more like a little ecosystem
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:49,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A jungle with all kinds of different entities
EDL	00:47:49,759	00:47:50,783	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Doing their own thing
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,319	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The one thing that they all do
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is used us
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,463	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To make copies of themselves
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:47:59,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	00:47:59,999	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In this vast
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:02,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:04,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In some part of your DNA you get some
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:05,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ancient fire
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:07,679	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It just keeps
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Happy
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:11,263	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Little further down the line
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,055	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Another one
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,335	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do the same thing
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:21,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then in some other part of your DNA 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
EDL	00:48:21,759	00:48:25,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just copying itself again and again and again and again
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:29,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Almost everywhere you look you have these dumb bits and TNA just
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:32,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Copying themselves over and over again
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:38,399	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Building up yourselves with useless DNA looks like a hitchhiker that gets into your car you turn around suddenly
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:40,959	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is it a Fred there's now Fred and Fred
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:46,847	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah and then turn around again this Fred and Fred and Fred right I mean Fred and Fred and Fred and Fred and
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's pretty much how you end up with these super huge dinos
EDL	00:48:52,223	00:48:52,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sometimes
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:54,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Back and bi Pride
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:56,575	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay so
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:59,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Brian told me about this particular sound
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:01,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Certain group of salamanders
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,463	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Caballito glycemia
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is part of the
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:06,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Very large family of salamanders that live all over the Western half of
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	North America
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:14,751	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A long long time ago something happened in the environment that made the salamanders get
EDL	00:49:14,751	00:49:15,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Littler
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,287	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Define
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Except for this one problem they have big genomes
EDL	00:49:19,359	00:49:21,407	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And the more DNA there is
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:23,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The bigger the cell is
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Saumur DNA
EDL	00:49:25,247	00:49:26,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Hagerstown
EDL	00:49:26,015	00:49:26,783	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Because
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:28,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	All the DNA have to go in the nucleus
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,111	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Of every single cell
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:32,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So as the salmon start getting smaller and smaller and smaller
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Their bodies are getting smaller
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:36,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And their heads are getting smaller
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Because they have these huge dinos
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:40,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They tend to have
EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:41,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Ignorance
EDL	00:49:41,375	00:49:43,935	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And now you're trying to cram a whole bunch of big neurons
EDL	00:49:44,447	00:49:46,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Into a tiny little skull
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:48,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well you're not going to fit as many and so
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,567	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Relative
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:51,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Two other salamanders
EDL	00:49:51,615	00:49:52,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That haven't been man tries
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Their Vision starts to degrade slightly their ability to
EDL	00:49:57,247	00:49:59,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Look around in the world and distinguish like
EDL	00:50:00,063	00:50:02,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What's an insect and what's a leaf
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gets worse Conte I can't do the kind of visual predation that you normally
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,023	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	See you in there was a relative
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Instead they
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:11,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Shifted to
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:13,631	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Being lie in wait predators
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:16,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Basically but having a huge genome
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Maybe salamanders get dumb
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:27,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I couldn't help but think about you know all the extra stuff you accumulate so.
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's almost hard to get in
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And close the door behind
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:35,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I like my partner and I have the storage closet that's just
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:39,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	With crap a watering can the broom and a car battery
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pile of button-down shirt
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:44,095	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I want a little bit too small ones
EDL	00:50:44,095	00:50:48,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's kind of boring how old is very uncomfortable
EDL	00:50:48,191	00:50:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A lot of it I don't even know why we happening there's like a three and a half foot tall roll
EDL	00:50:53,311	00:50:56,895	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Brown paper several unfinished art project rubric
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:59,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	. right now on top of that is a flower pot or air conditioner
EDL	00:51:00,479	00:51:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh there's another backpack
EDL	00:51:02,527	00:51:07,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Remember when I was in my twenties and like everything I own fit in a couple of suitcases I was light
EDL	00:51:07,647	00:51:09,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Agile free
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:10,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What now
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:11,487	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tupperware
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:12,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Bucket
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:13,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Full of paint
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:15,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Charcoal infused fabric
EDL	00:51:15,583	00:51:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I have so much of this stuff at least you don't have
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:20,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A closet in which
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Shoes replicate
EDL	00:51:21,727	00:51:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Themselves over and over again
EDL	00:51:26,335	00:51:30,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And you don't want to complain and feel very lucky to have all these possession but
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:34,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sometimes it's a pile up starts to feel like
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A bird it doesn't that feels like a bird like I feel like I'm going down the sound and it wrote just getting bigger
EDL	00:51:40,415	00:51:41,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dumber
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:41,951	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Slower
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:43,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Bigger and Dumber
EDL	00:51:43,231	00:51:44,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Slower
EDL	00:51:44,255	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There are definitely
EDL	00:51:45,535	00:51:46,559	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Surprises
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But then I talk to science writer Carl Zimmer and he made me feel a little bit better about all the extra
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Junk
EDL	00:51:53,727	00:51:54,751	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In my closet
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In myself
EDL	00:51:56,543	00:51:58,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Literally none of us would be here
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:01,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	If not for that one gene
EDL	00:52:01,663	00:52:04,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Because he says there's one little bit of DNA that
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Climbed out of the junk closet
EDL	00:52:07,039	00:52:08,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And made all of us
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:11,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What what is it
EDL	00:52:11,135	00:52:13,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well you've actually heard about it before
EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Really special about mammals is that
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:16,767	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Female mammal
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:18,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Placental mammal
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Carrie young around inside
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	David quammen told us about it in a little while ago called infective heredity and it's basically this
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:30,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gene that makes a protein
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:31,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which helps makes himself
EDL	00:52:31,871	00:52:35,199	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Elsie's very special layers of cells in placenta
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Cells that let it
EDL	00:52:36,479	00:52:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Grab onto
EDL	00:52:38,015	00:52:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The mother's uterus and pull nutrients in to feed
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The embryo has nutrients
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:47,487	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It protects the fetus from the mother's immune system
EDL	00:52:47,999	00:52:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Now when we talk to David about it and how did we get that good idea
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We got that good idea from a virus
EDL	00:52:53,375	00:52:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We should have a maze that this Gene had come from a virus
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:53:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But what I learned from Carla is that this little Jean sat in the junk closet of our DNA for millions of
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:03,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Years
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Doing nothing making little copies of
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:07,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's not

EDL	00:56:02,815	00:56:05,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To sound that you hear when you're standing on the platform
EDL	00:56:05,887	00:56:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And the train is just about to leave the station
EDL	00:56:10,239	00:56:11,007	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And

EDL	00:57:35,487	00:57:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I got a feeling
EDL	00:57:39,583	00:57:40,863	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's Jamie Bernstein

EDL	00:57:58,015	00:57:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	YouTube somewhere like people were really not
EDL	00:57:59,807	00:58:00,575	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How to sing it around New York
EDL	00:58:01,599	00:58:02,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay so
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The question is there's a sound in the subway
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:06,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Right
EDL	00:58:07,743	00:58:09,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There's a sound in the subway
EDL	00:58:11,327	00:58:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where does it originate
EDL	00:58:12,607	00:58:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	From and is there anything
EDL	00:58:14,655	00:58:16,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Interesting and beautiful about
EDL	00:58:16,447	00:58:17,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Why it exists
EDL	00:58:19,007	00:58:20,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's my question
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:22,079	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And do you have any I guess what makes that sound
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is it the train that is singing this to me or is it the steel rails under the train that's what I thought it was
EDL	00:58:29,503	00:58:32,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I thought maybe it was it was you listening
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:33,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Actually
EDL	00:58:34,367	00:58:35,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I thought it was a train coming
EDL	00:58:36,415	00:58:37,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Rounding the
EDL	00:58:37,183	00:58:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The corner as its
EDL	00:58:38,207	00:58:39,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Coming in
EDL	00:58:39,743	00:58:41,023	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To the platform
EDL	00:58:41,023	00:58:45,631	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's scraping its side against the incoming think
EDL	00:58:45,631	00:58:46,911	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And that's creating a
EDL	00:58:46,911	00:58:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Squeal
EDL	00:58:47,679	00:58:49,471	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It just so happened to always hit that pitch
EDL	00:58:51,007	00:58:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	No
EDL	00:58:52,543	00:58:53,567	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But that's not it

EDL	01:01:15,135	01:01:17,951	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To explain to you why it has the sound
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:18,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sheldon Cana Punta
EDL	01:01:19,743	01:01:20,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm so
EDL	01:01:21,279	01:01:23,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We had to reach out to someone for some help
EDL	01:01:23,327	01:01:24,351	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Oh yeah I could tell you
EDL	01:01:24,863	01:01:27,679	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Absolutely sorry and I called up
EDL	01:01:27,679	01:01:28,447	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Jeff hackner
EDL	01:01:28,447	01:01:29,983	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Patrick professorville
EDL	01:01:29,983	01:01:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Electrical Computer Engineering at Cooper Union
EDL	01:01:32,287	01:01:35,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where I fought for 25 years
EDL	01:01:35,615	01:01:36,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Who works at the end
EDL	01:01:36,639	01:01:40,223	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	NTA and they referred to as a legend in
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:40,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Transit Circle
EDL	01:01:42,783	01:01:45,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm not sure I'm not sure who said that and
EDL	01:01:45,599	01:01:49,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	How much they had to drink when they said that but
EDL	01:01:49,439	01:01:50,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	01:01:50,207	01:01:51,743	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I've been involved for many years
EDL	01:01:51,743	01:01:53,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And Jeff broke down the
EDL	01:01:53,279	01:01:54,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The singing box for us like this
EDL	01:01:55,327	01:01:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You started by telling us how the Box even got into the trance to begin with
EDL	01:01:59,679	01:02:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Stand clear of the closing doors
EDL	01:02:01,727	01:02:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So what happened is about the year 2000
EDL	01:02:08,127	01:02:12,223	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Thousand around the time America was obsessed with
EDL	01:02:12,735	01:02:14,271	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Computer bugs go bald
EDL	01:02:15,551	01:02:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Stolen elections
EDL	01:02:17,599	01:02:18,111	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Decided
EDL	01:02:18,623	01:02:21,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They needed to radically redesign the cars
EDL	01:02:21,439	01:02:23,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Bente was like we need a massive upgrade
EDL	01:02:23,999	01:02:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So they brought in all of these new train cars or 142s
EDL	01:02:28,607	01:02:31,423	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Call them the new tech train new technology train
EDL	01:02:31,935	01:02:33,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It was going to be a whole new era
EDL	01:02:33,727	01:02:36,287	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	These trains were going to be more energy efficient
EDL	01:02:36,287	01:02:36,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	01:02:37,823	01:02:39,103	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	One big problem
EDL	01:02:39,103	01:02:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The newer train
EDL	01:02:41,151	01:02:43,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Those require alternating current
EDL	01:02:43,455	01:02:45,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The system is a direct current system
EDL	01:02:46,527	01:02:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The third rail is direct current
EDL	01:02:48,319	01:02:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In other words
EDL	01:02:49,855	01:02:51,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	There's a power mismatch
EDL	01:02:52,671	01:02:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The new trains run on
EDL	01:02:53,951	01:02:55,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	AC power
EDL	01:02:55,231	01:02:57,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The subway system could only provide
EDL	01:02:57,279	01:02:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	DC power
EDL	01:02:59,583	01:03:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wait they brought in trains
EDL	01:03:01,375	01:03:02,911	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It ran on the wrong kind of power
EDL	01:03:03,679	01:03:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yes
EDL	01:03:04,703	01:03:06,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When was AC when was DC
EDL	01:03:07,263	01:03:09,823	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What exactly is the difference between AC and DC again
EDL	01:03:11,103	01:03:17,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's all based on the flow of invisible electricity when you have BC
EDL	01:03:17,503	01:03:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Power of the fluids long smooth but steady like a straight line with a C
EDL	01:03:23,903	01:03:30,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Play pulsing kind of
EDL	01:03:30,303	01:03:31,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Find weight of a sinusoidal wave
EDL	01:03:32,607	01:03:34,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The same shape that governs
EDL	01:03:34,655	01:03:35,167	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The tides
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:36,959	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The phase of the moon
EDL	01:03:37,727	01:03:39,007	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The angle of the Sun
EDL	01:03:39,007	01:03:40,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Someone is smooth and what is Anjali
EDL	01:03:40,799	01:03:41,567	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Exact
EDL	01:03:41,567	01:03:44,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Play an AC and DC don't play well together definitely not
EDL	01:03:44,639	01:03:46,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And they knew this when they introduce the new cars
EDL	01:03:46,943	01:03:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah they knew
EDL	01:03:47,967	01:03:49,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The tracks have been
EDL	01:03:49,247	01:03:50,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Providing.
EDL	01:03:50,015	01:03:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	DC power for like
EDL	01:03:51,039	01:03:53,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	96 years so they weren't going to remake the
EDL	01:03:53,343	01:03:55,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The tracks cuz then you'd have to shut down
EDL	01:03:55,135	01:03:56,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The whole Subway for years
EDL	01:03:56,927	01:03:57,951	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But they needed to use
EDL	01:03:57,951	01:04:01,279	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	AC for these new cars because there was so much more energy
EDL	01:04:01,279	01:04:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Efficient and so
EDL	01:04:02,815	01:04:03,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It was a disconnect
EDL	01:04:06,655	01:04:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The sharks in the
EDL	01:04:07,423	01:04:12,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The Jets anyways MTA had to figure out a way to take this kind of electricity
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:13,567	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And turn it into this
EDL	01:04:14,335	01:04:18,175	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Not interested
EDL	01:04:18,175	01:04:24,575	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The song is General where the singing box comes in threes module 8 strange DC
EDL	01:04:24,575	01:04:25,599	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To a safe place
EDL	01:04:25,599	01:04:27,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The box of Sheldon showed us
EDL	01:04:27,647	01:04:30,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's what translates the electricity from one kinds the other
EDL	01:04:31,231	01:04:34,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And basically what these boxes do
EDL	01:04:35,327	01:04:37,631	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is that when the train is cruising along
EDL	01:04:38,655	01:04:41,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Drawing and DC power from the third rail
EDL	01:04:41,983	01:04:45,823	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Power goes into that little box in the engine and inside that box
EDL	01:04:46,591	01:04:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Are these little transistors as switches
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:52,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Like like light switches
EDL	01:04:52,991	01:04:58,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The switches go on and off on and off on and off really fast and in the process take that DC current
EDL	01:04:59,391	01:05:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And I guess you could say like chop it up
EDL	01:05:02,719	01:05:03,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where does the sound come in
EDL	01:05:05,535	01:05:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay so this is the part
EDL	01:05:07,327	01:05:08,351	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That I don't
EDL	01:05:08,351	01:05:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Fully
EDL	01:05:09,119	01:05:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In my soul understand
EDL	01:05:11,167	01:05:13,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But it's Jeff explained it to us
EDL	01:05:13,727	01:05:16,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Flow of current in and out of these devices
EDL	01:05:16,799	01:05:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Creates mechanical stresses within them
EDL	01:05:19,359	01:05:21,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When you feed electricity into the box
EDL	01:05:21,663	01:05:23,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The transistors on the inside of the box
EDL	01:05:23,455	01:05:24,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Any inductors in the various things
EDL	01:05:25,503	01:05:26,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It gets sort of Jaws
EDL	01:05:27,551	01:05:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And when they do but act like little loudspeakers
EDL	01:05:31,391	01:05:33,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They're not designed as loud speakers
EDL	01:05:34,207	01:05:39,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But any of these devices when you flow alternating current flow through them will have
EDL	01:05:40,351	01:05:41,887	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Some tone
EDL	01:05:41,887	01:05:42,399	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Admitted
EDL	01:05:43,423	01:05:47,263	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And it's the current interacting with these like physical parts
EDL	01:05:48,287	01:05:49,823	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah that's what's making the sound
EDL	01:05:50,335	01:05:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Okay then a bunch of very complicated stuff happy
EDL	01:05:55,199	01:05:57,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But all you really need to know is that
EDL	01:05:57,247	01:05:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When you run current through the box
EDL	01:05:59,039	01:06:01,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The stuff on the inside of the Box gets stress
EDL	01:06:01,343	01:06:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Vibrate
EDL	01:06:02,623	01:06:03,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I guess
EDL	01:06:03,391	01:06:04,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And that creates
EDL	01:06:04,671	01:06:06,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	High-pitched whining sound
EDL	01:06:06,719	01:06:07,743	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The changes
EDL	01:06:07,743	01:06:08,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pitch depending on
EDL	01:06:09,791	01:06:10,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And that's
EDL	01:06:10,815	01:06:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Kind of the key to the melody
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:15,935	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The transistors chop up the electricity at different rates
EDL	01:06:15,935	01:06:17,471	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Depending on how fast the train is
EDL	01:06:17,471	01:06:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's going
EDL	01:06:18,239	01:06:19,263	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And the train has
EDL	01:06:19,263	01:06:20,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	3 gears
EDL	01:06:20,543	01:06:22,335	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well you can think of them like gears
EDL	01:06:22,847	01:06:23,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gear one is when
EDL	01:06:23,871	01:06:24,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It starts out
EDL	01:06:24,639	01:06:27,711	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Twin sisters are doing their thing and this is the sound that comes out
EDL	01:06:28,479	01:06:34,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I meant the train shift to a higher gear as it accelerates and then this is the sound that comes out
EDL	01:06:35,391	01:06:39,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And then is a train settles into a Groove the transistors slow and then this is
EDL	01:06:39,999	01:06:41,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sound that comes out
EDL	01:06:42,303	01:06:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which gives you that Melody
EDL	01:06:52,543	01:06:54,591	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And now we get to the real Quest
EDL	01:06:54,591	01:06:55,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sandwiches
EDL	01:06:55,615	01:06:56,383	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is that a fluke
EDL	01:06:58,687	01:07:00,479	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Or could that Melody be intention
EDL	01:07:00,991	01:07:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	01:07:02,015	01:07:02,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So
EDL	01:07:03,039	01:07:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	We asked Sheldon from the MTA
EDL	01:07:04,831	01:07:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do you think that those
EDL	01:07:06,879	01:07:08,159	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Notes are like
EDL	01:07:08,927	01:07:09,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just
EDL	01:07:09,695	01:07:13,535	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Coincidence like that's just the sound that it makes or like could they have been select
EDL	01:07:14,047	01:07:15,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	No it's not
EDL	01:07:15,327	01:07:16,863	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's not on purpose to keep
EDL	01:07:17,375	01:07:18,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To like to hear that song
EDL	01:07:19,167	01:07:22,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's not to let us hear West Side Story in the subway
EDL	01:07:23,519	01:07:26,335	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But then we talked to Jeff hackner
EDL	01:07:27,359	01:07:28,383	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He told us
EDL	01:07:28,895	01:07:30,943	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The when you're designing a system like
EDL	01:07:30,943	01:07:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That singing box with the three gears
EDL	01:07:33,247	01:07:34,271	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Each gear
EDL	01:07:34,271	01:07:35,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Does have its own settings
EDL	01:07:35,807	01:07:37,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Frequency of electricity
EDL	01:07:38,111	01:07:40,415	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And if you're the engineer you're setting that
EDL	01:07:40,415	01:07:41,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	For each of the three gears
EDL	01:07:41,951	01:07:42,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And
EDL	01:07:42,719	01:07:44,255	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You're picking a frequency
EDL	01:07:44,767	01:07:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That
EDL	01:07:45,535	01:07:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is
EDL	01:07:47,071	01:07:48,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Knocking overheat the equipment
EDL	01:07:48,607	01:07:50,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And at the same time is
EDL	01:07:50,143	01:07:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Is fast enough
EDL	01:07:51,167	01:07:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That it's going to average out to this nice smooth sine wave
EDL	01:07:54,495	01:07:56,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I think it's interesting that you use the word
EDL	01:07:56,799	01:07:57,311	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Kik
EDL	01:07:58,335	01:07:59,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What does a part of your kids
EDL	01:07:59,615	01:08:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Conspiracy Theory
EDL	01:08:01,151	01:08:03,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That that that somebody design these
EDL	01:08:03,967	01:08:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	3 notes
EDL	01:08:05,503	01:08:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Guess what
EDL	01:08:07,551	01:08:08,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What I want to know is
EDL	01:08:08,831	01:08:09,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Whether or not
EDL	01:08:10,111	01:08:10,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Possible to
EDL	01:08:11,135	01:08:11,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To have that kind
EDL	01:08:12,159	01:08:12,927	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Control
EDL	01:08:12,927	01:08:14,207	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Choose the frequency
EDL	01:08:15,231	01:08:15,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yes
EDL	01:08:15,999	01:08:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Engineer codes
EDL	01:08:17,791	01:08:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Say I could pick a frequency between 1500
EDL	01:08:21,119	01:08:21,631	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	3000
EDL	01:08:22,399	01:08:23,167	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm going to
EDL	01:08:23,679	01:08:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm going to
EDL	01:08:24,703	01:08:28,031	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pick a DA in the 6th octave because I think that's funny
EDL	01:08:28,799	01:08:33,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What so that is totally possible or because you have a little bit of wiggle room within the design
EDL	01:08:34,431	01:08:35,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Interested
EDL	01:08:36,223	01:08:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So he sang
EDL	01:08:37,247	01:08:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Possible
EDL	01:08:38,015	01:08:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But the engineer who designed the singing box
EDL	01:08:40,319	01:08:41,343	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Set the gears at
EDL	01:08:41,343	01:08:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	At just the right frequency
EDL	01:08:42,623	01:08:43,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	He's to make just the right size
EDL	01:08:44,415	01:08:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So what you saying
EDL	01:08:45,183	01:08:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yes
EDL	01:08:47,231	01:08:47,999	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Did you find
EDL	01:08:49,535	01:08:51,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The person who made the design choice
EDL	01:08:51,839	01:08:54,399	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Well you know we made a lot of calls
EDL	01:08:54,911	01:08:55,423	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But
EDL	01:08:56,703	01:08:59,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah we totally didn't Carter can you hear this high

EDL	01:09:31,263	01:09:33,567	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What so he is the guy one of the guys
EDL	01:09:33,567	01:09:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah back in about 2000 time
EDL	01:09:36,127	01:09:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I was young and cocky design engineer
EDL	01:09:41,503	01:09:43,807	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And for propulsion and breaking
EDL	01:09:43,807	01:09:48,671	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Matt told us he was part of the team that designs that are 142 and all the stuff that goes in
EDL	01:09:48,671	01:09:55,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Since I got all the equipment setup including the motors
EDL	01:09:55,071	01:09:56,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Single aspect of the design
EDL	01:09:56,607	01:09:58,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Including the singing box
EDL	01:09:59,167	01:10:01,471	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And when we asked him about the sound
EDL	01:10:01,983	01:10:04,543	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This is a very distinct sound that everybody talks
EDL	01:10:06,335	01:10:12,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah I'm not only that he's a Musician musician way before I was an engineer
EDL	01:10:12,735	01:10:16,831	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Enough in a couple of hours I'm going to have to leave you if you're not bored to death by your story
EDL	01:10:17,343	01:10:21,695	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To practice with with a band were giving a concert in a couple of days in Montreal
EDL	01:10:21,695	01:10:26,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	What's your van then what are you play actually replace very
EDL	01:10:28,351	01:10:29,119	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Quirky
EDL	01:10:29,119	01:10:30,143	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Bizarre funny
EDL	01:10:30,143	01:10:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	French song that you would not understand but
EDL	01:10:32,703	01:10:33,471	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Dirt bike funny
EDL	01:10:40,127	01:10:42,175	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Home visits
EDL	01:10:42,175	01:10:43,199	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	His band
EDL	01:10:43,199	01:10:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Playing ACDC
EDL	01:10:44,991	01:10:45,503	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	In French
EDL	01:10:46,015	01:10:47,295	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	AC DC
EDL	01:10:47,295	01:10:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Very appropriate and some of the other stuff is
EDL	01:10:49,855	01:10:51,647	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Very musical theater e
EDL	01:10:51,647	01:10:56,511	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Which made us think what is this West Side Story stuff was intentional
EDL	01:10:57,791	01:11:01,631	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Do you have this musician turned engineer slipping in a little Easter egg
EDL	01:11:01,631	01:11:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A little gift
EDL	01:11:04,447	01:11:05,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	All the New Yorkers
EDL	01:11:05,727	01:11:07,519	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The ride the subway every single day
EDL	01:11:10,847	01:11:14,687	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And in fact Matthew told us that after the Subways were unveiled
EDL	01:11:14,687	01:11:15,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	People began to notice
EDL	01:11:15,967	01:11:16,735	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sound
EDL	01:11:16,735	01:11:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Even wrote a white page
EDL	01:11:18,271	01:11:18,783	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Paper
EDL	01:11:19,807	01:11:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Where he came clean
EDL	01:11:21,087	01:11:23,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And here's a spoiler out of
EDL	01:11:24,671	01:11:25,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The punch
EDL	01:11:25,439	01:11:26,975	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Of this white paper was
EDL	01:11:29,023	01:11:30,303	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Choice of notes is a
EDL	01:11:30,303	01:11:31,327	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Pure coincidence
EDL	01:11:32,863	01:11:36,703	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I know II Des is this is this is a this is really
EDL	01:11:36,703	01:11:37,727	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Spoiling your shirt
EDL	01:11:38,239	01:11:39,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm totally sure
EDL	01:11:42,079	01:11:43,615	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	So they did choose the notes
EDL	01:11:44,383	01:11:45,919	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But not for any musical reason
EDL	01:11:46,431	01:11:47,455	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Write in fact
EDL	01:11:47,455	01:11:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Just a sort of
EDL	01:11:48,479	01:11:49,759	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Twist the knife a little bit
EDL	01:11:49,759	01:11:52,063	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	She told us the first time I watch
EDL	01:11:52,063	01:11:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	West Side Story was probably
EDL	01:11:55,391	01:11:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	A couple of days ago and found it way too cheesy for me
EDL	01:11:59,743	01:12:04,607	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Yeah what about is it possible some of the other engineers in the room had
EDL	01:12:04,607	01:12:06,911	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	You don't know one in that room recognized
EDL	01:12:06,911	01:12:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Those intervals
EDL	01:12:08,191	01:12:08,703	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I can
EDL	01:12:09,471	01:12:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Sure you
EDL	01:12:10,751	01:12:12,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That I'm on my deathbed
EDL	01:12:12,799	01:12:14,847	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I will continue saying that
EDL	01:12:14,847	01:12:15,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	No one
EDL	01:12:15,871	01:12:18,687	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	At the time really cared or reading you
EDL	01:12:21,247	01:12:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	But even though my fantasy wasn't
EDL	01:12:23,551	01:12:24,319	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Real
EDL	01:12:24,319	01:12:27,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I think what is what is real is the way it is received
EDL	01:12:27,135	01:12:28,159	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Gina Anselmo
EDL	01:12:28,159	01:12:29,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	It's their weather by
EDL	01:12:29,439	01:12:30,719	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Buy incident or
EDL	01:12:30,719	01:12:31,743	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	On purpose boat
EDL	01:12:32,255	01:12:34,815	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The way it's received as by all these people who
EDL	01:12:34,815	01:12:35,839	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Are either
EDL	01:12:35,839	01:12:38,399	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Unconsciously or consciously hearing this like
EDL	01:12:38,911	01:12:42,239	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	More pleasant melody in the horrible you know
EDL	01:12:42,239	01:12:43,775	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Reaching for the subway
EDL	01:12:43,775	01:12:44,799	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Truth is like
EDL	01:12:44,799	01:12:47,359	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Lovely reminiscent Melody that
EDL	01:12:47,359	01:12:49,663	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That's so many of us are familiar with
EDL	01:12:49,663	01:12:50,431	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And it's
EDL	01:12:50,431	01:12:51,199	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	This
EDL	01:12:51,199	01:12:54,527	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Romantic Anthem to reconciling difference
EDL	01:12:54,527	01:12:58,111	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Wait remind me what is the story that they sing in that song Somewhere
EDL	01:12:58,111	01:12:59,391	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	When at the end of the play

EDL	01:13:29,343	01:13:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	I'm trying to
EDL	01:13:30,367	01:13:31,135	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	To rise above it
EDL	01:13:31,903	01:13:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And so they sing this song
EDL	01:13:35,743	01:13:39,071	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Play
EDL	01:13:41,631	01:13:44,191	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	And they imagine this place that doesn't yet
EDL	01:13:44,191	01:13:45,215	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Exist for them
EDL	01:13:45,215	01:13:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	They imagined
EDL	01:13:46,751	01:13:47,263	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	The song
EDL	01:13:47,775	01:13:51,871	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	That that doesn't fact raise them all above the horror in the
EDL	01:13:54,431	01:13:56,479	| radiolab_podcast19askinganotherfriend |	Tragedy in the violence
