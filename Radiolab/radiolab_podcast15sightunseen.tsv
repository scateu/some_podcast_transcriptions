EDL	00:00:54,528	00:00:57,856	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Kind of a question
EDL	00:00:57,856	00:01:02,208	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But I should say that there are some moments in the story that get a little
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The word
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:05,024	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Heavy heavy
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	To be forewarned
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,864	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But we'll start with the picture taker

EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:36,000	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	In case this particular story that can you set it up a little bit
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:36,512	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Shorts
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So in December of 2009 for Time Magazine

EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Station database
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	In the middle of the desert
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I was
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Embedded with the Medevac team and their role is to go in and pick up injured troops out of
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The theater of war is a small team of basically helicopter Pilots Medics doctors basically whenever there's
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Winter Soldier
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:09,280	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	These teams are called whichever team is closest to the injured Kentucky like helicopter dropping into
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Yeah I mean this is fast
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	2 Lindsey had been embedded with this team for a couple of days
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:20,544	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And not much will happen if you just sitting around reading magazines I've been re-reading the same magazines and one night
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:26,176	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I think I was lying in bed and I was totally like if I wasn't asleep I was on the verge of sleep when they
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Someone ran was like
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	There's an alpha alpha is like
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,136	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Alpha means the most
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Gravely wounded like you have seconds to get there I mean is it's life-or-death so she grabs two cameras her helmet body armor
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:45,120	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Runs Out to the Blackhawk I strap myself in and we take off
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I think it was about a 2-minute
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Flight which is so fast
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I remember I was shooting the fields as we flew in because I was trying to focus and see
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But I can see luckily they had lent me a set of night vision goggles which was really nice of the military
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Because you can't see anything without them in the middle of the night because they are using my fishing so they don't ever turn on the lights
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Look see the camera directly you would see nothing just nothing so what you do for photographer do you put the night vision
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Goggles in front of the camera lens so it looks green it's fluorescent cream
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:29,408	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I mean the picture you get is green yes so they fly for two minutes to the pitch black land the helicopter she has no
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	No idea where everything is happening extremely fast I'm trying to focus as I'm looking out the helicopter.
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And suddenly my viewfinder I see
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	A man
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Serve wrapped I think he was wrapped in a blanket and he's
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He gets
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Courtright
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	In front of me on the floor of that of the Blackhawk
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The first thing I thought
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Is I think he's already dead
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He seemed completely unresponsive
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And he seemed so young I just remember looking at his face and thinking
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,784	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	By what are we doing here
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Within seconds there are born again flying back
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:14,464	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Field Hospital Lindsay takes pictures on that brief light back grainy fluorescent
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:18,303	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Green images of the Medics 10 Soldier checking his vitals
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Wheel and
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	At the field Hospital in the hospital tent
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The anesthesiologist everyone is there a carry him inside and put them immediately on the table
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Cut his clothes off their cutting his pants off open up his shirt and the room
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Start filling up
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	With everyone because everyone has heard that there's a
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And so troops come in from across the base
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Children support
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She says with a minister room went from the handful of people 5 6
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,655	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Do a dozen 28 you can hear a pin drop
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'm in the room is
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Silent except for the doctors
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:07,711	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You know they're trying to resuscitate him he had lost I think eight or nine pints of blood they're bringing in blood
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Everything in all sorts of things
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,831	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Well yeah of course you know I'm basically trying to be invisible because it's so sensitive to be a photographer
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Current situation
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What I do I don't shoot like thing I've ever I shoot
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	1 frame
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And then I put my camera down
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I shoot another frame
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Cuz you can hear the click of the shutter
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And it is like exponentially louder than normal in a situation like that
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What did you get did anyone look give you a look
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Back off at one point I was shooting for probably
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I don't know five or six minutes maybe and an officer walked over to me
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And he said
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Hey stop photograph
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Yeah and I put the camera down and I looked at him and I said
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I have permission
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Kid worked all that out beforehand
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What are the conditions over in bed at all these conversations you know what happens in the case of this what is my ass
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:14,527	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Access what can I do but this one she says the room was full of people from across the base who didn't know any of that
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Didn't know who she was but she had permission and so she was sort of at this fork in the road
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	There is always like that officer clearly felt with camera.
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:26,815	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Stop
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Obviously this is not the time to argue or to be disrespectful so I didn't say anything else I put the camera down but uses the moment she
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She did that several other troop said no
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Let her shoot this has to be documented interesting so you have one guy who says you can't take a picture of
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Of this right almost like anything but this other guy is like no
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Especially right right first of all the guy who said no was being protective it makes perfect sense for
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:59,327	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But I think the guy to who stood up and said this has to be documented
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I think it's some point everyone realize like look this war is not going away we are losing so
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,055	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	How many lives and Limbs and no one is seeing it
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And keep in mind this is 2009 this is
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Just the tail end of a
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:18,015	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	18 year ban where the news media couldn't even photograph
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Military coffins
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Andie Case the officer Let It Go Lindsey continue to take pictures for about another 20 minutes
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She took pictures of the doctors cutting open the boy's chest massaging his heart at some point I remember someone one of the doctors
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:35,935	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It looked up and said does anyone else have any suggestions basically 4 how to save him
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,471	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Everyone said now and they should have disconnected the time he died
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	People were looking down and then they were looking at each other and
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Someone went to go get a flag and American flag to drape over
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	First body I continued photographing and there was a moment where
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The whole room was silent and people stood around
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	His body draped with a flag
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And said a prayer
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That to me
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Is one of the most powerful images that came out of this whole series
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,823	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	There's an old idea in photography called the decisive moment
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The world is filled with these far-off realities but every so often a photograph can capture a moment
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Takes you there
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This is one of those photos
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And the picture you see all these men and women standing in kind of a loose semicircle
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,511	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Some of them still have the blue surgical gloves on
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They look totally spent
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,095	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They're all looking in different directions
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And they all look
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You're not even there
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I totally lost in their own thoughts
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Their attention is
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Clearly
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	In words
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:48,383	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Yeah I'm sure all those troops were like
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Cod it. Could have been me
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Why couldn't we save him
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What are we doing here in Afghanistan is this world worth it
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And read the Expressions on their faces like it's even you can be at War as a journalist
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Never actually get to the heart of the war because
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:09,375	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	We don't have access or people don't open up and I felt like I really had reached
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,911	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Like the
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Crocs in the war
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	State was war
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Using an essence
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,543	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	If something
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Attention problem
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,407	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Any photos that she had taken that included that soldiers face
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Or any other identifying marks like tattoos and he didn't have tattoos
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	According to the rules of her in bed
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She couldn't use those photos without the soldiers permission you never got to speak to him
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	No
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So was it
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Days later
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Weeks Later months later where you began to ask yourself can I eat it was minutes later
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Military does not let journalists cover something like this without coming directly to that person and so
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Literally like I followed
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The young man's body out to the morgue
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And had to walk him outside
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I remember it was the moon was so bright that night and I was shooting with the Moonlight as he was B
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Carried outside
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And then I went back to the tent where I was staying
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Within minutes of the military payo the Marines public affairs officers
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He said you know you can't send those images out without permission from the next of kin
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That's the rule for soldiers unconscious and then dies before giving permission I have to then go to the next of kin then I said
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:33,343	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Set of course I understand you know I'm not doing anything with those photos in that moment I sign this piece of paper
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:37,183	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	When I give my word I keep that word you know but then the other side of me was like
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	F*** you know in Vietnam no one was signing pieces of paper and in Vietnam no one had to
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	To go to the next to Kin before they publish anything and that's why the American public I think
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:55,359	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Rose up against the war in Vietnam because they saw them was graphic devastating images that were uncensored
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So then what do you do in that situation room science I mean
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I imagine you go to the next of kin right well you're not allowed as a journalist to reach out to the next if they asked me are you
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Are you interested in being contacted by the next of kin if they're willing to speak to you so you can even know
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'll give you the information but I said you know of course I would like to be contacted by the next Canon please
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,167	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Pass my information on and
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I was sort of just waiting
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'm at this point where you thinking the pictures that ever see the light of day
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I had no idea
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,479	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Few days later
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,271	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Maybe you're less than a week
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Her in bed was over she was flying to JFK on her way to meet her family for Christmas
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And why voicemails on my telephone
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I listened that it was his father
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Any left a voicemail and he said I understand
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You were with my son

EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Anticipating how difficult that phone call with me
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,015	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That phone call

EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They told me story after story about how he doted on his sisters
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I would love to read and want to become a history teacher after his four years in the Marines
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And inevitably the conversation turned to the day that they found out he died December 1st 2009

EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Oh my God they're two marines at the door
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And we just kind of like like left everything
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Zooted the girls jump in the car race over
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Who made all the girls stay in the car
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I remember walking in the door and everyone just had this look on their face like
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The world
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It just ended
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Dandong
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I remember asking what happened
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The first thing I did was run to his room because
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Everything with the same before you left
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Open having his closet
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I'm grabbing one of his shirts and just holding on to it because it still had it sitting on it
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I was really hard
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	One thing I never occurred to me
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Totally caught me off guard in thinking about
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Those pictures
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Is that
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,639	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	When does Marines came to the door
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And told them
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The news
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Well they didn't actually give much news
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This right here was one of this is what was red
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Galaxy read me the circumstances of death statement
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:15,327	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Hostile action result of multiple traumatic injuries received as a member of a dismounted patrol
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That was struck by an ID while conducting combat operations in the Helmand Province
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That was that on patrol night Patrol that's all I had
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She didn't know anything
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That's it
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:31,199	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Jonathan's unit was still in Afghanistan so he
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Couldn't talk to anyone he had no clue what happened to his son so when that casualty assistance officer
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Told him
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I see there's a photographer in the room
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,439	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	With your son when he died
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'm a class like I wanted
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Want to color
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Earlier in my conversation with Lindsey I'd ask her
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What do you remember the call
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So the call
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,703	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I went to my mother's house in Connecticut
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:59,103	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I asked my mother to be left alone which in a big Italian American family means
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Look at me like what
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What happened to the gas bedroom
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I called him
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And he picked up
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I think he thanked me for calling him
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,487	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I don't remember exactly what we said but I said
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You know
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I was with your son when he died
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I will give you as much or as little information as you want
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And he said
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I want to know everything
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,311	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Because I wasn't there
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:29,823	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I was here
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He said I want to know every single thing I want to be with my son not be there for him.
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That's notes hard
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Really hard
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,623	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I felt very awkward because I felt like
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:49,535	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	We know why was I privy to this moment and he is the father could not be perfect
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Most important question me was
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,863	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They suffered you think it is ever
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I said
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Now she told me Miss Taylor I don't I don't think you separate I think
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He was in shock
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:05,919	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I told him everything how much blood is Sun lost how long did they try to save him and at some point
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I said look I have these pictures I have
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	All of these pictures I shot everything
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I need your permission to publish the ones that show his face
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She asked me a proclamation and
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,232	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He was quiet
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I said
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,608	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I told her yes
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But that
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He said II can I see them
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I wanted to see him first
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Before I give permission I want to see every photo
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I said you know I'm not sure you want to see these photos
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:44,064	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Cuz they're graphic but he wanted to see the outfit he wanted to see every photo all of them
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:49,952	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Course I we were on the phone I couldn't jump pictures and legally I needed
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Permission from Time Magazine to show anything because
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It was a journalist you can't show anything to anyone until it's published you don't show people pictures of
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:00,704	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Journalism before you publish them
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:06,848	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This is one of those Cardinal rules it's drilled into every journalist said if you show a subject the raw stuff before it's out there
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You kind of given up the only Independence you've got
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,528	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That's why she says ordinarily I would never ever ever get out for a second if
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He to be cynical about it if you show him the picture
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:21,440	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He might take away permissions you might have otherwise give you exactly
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Exactly you can say is a publication no I won't show those pictures before you have to just say yes or no
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,864	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What do you give your permission
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:35,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Like it anyway if you get down to it I feel like one of the fundamental layers here is just like a question of whose rights
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:39,360	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Comes to that information is more important I could hear an argument that says
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:43,968	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The battle is important it was authorized by public figures it is carrying
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	America's message into the world
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:48,576	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And shouldn't Americans see what goes on
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:53,696	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Yeah but I could hear an argument says shouldn't dad be able to protect who sees his son
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Malaysian
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Mini case Lindsay called redditors a time they had a series of conversations that went all the way up to the editor of time we had a
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Very intense conversation and we collectively made a decision to show him the photos
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,616	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	To say that decision was unusual from their perspective
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:13,408	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Would be severely underweight
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:17,248	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	When I first got these
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'm from
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:19,552	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	FedEx
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I know they were coming
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I was actually
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,696	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Scared to look at
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I saw my son there
EDL	00:23:30,304	00:23:31,840	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I just kept looking
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I don't mind looking
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You can see
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	These were they in the Medevac when they got him on
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You see the night vision lens there is Jonathan's body
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:46,944	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I just there's a space thirsty ox
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Plus watch on still she is as close to her that was
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,392	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So many hands not working
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Consider doing CPR there
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	No
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Are you saying
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:04,096	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Right leg is really
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,120	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Mangled
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Unbroken
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That's really why I lost so much blood it was just
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	All right in here some of these pictures that are really hard to see ya
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,384	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Leaving now
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They show that messed up War
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I got a piece of Jonathan
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,368	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This is as my treasure
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,208	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Now she want the pictures that
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	To me it's
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It always stands out
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,352	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He brought up the picture of the prayer
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	All those people standing in a semicircle
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Far Away Eyes running
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:43,264	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	When you see a little different interfaces hair
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I mean
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Hitman something
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,384	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He was somebody
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,992	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It wasn't just a number
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Dad said you wanted people to see this picture
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,112	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And the others to convey
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What's
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,952	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Happy over there
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This going on everyday
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And he says for him it's not a political thing
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,608	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You can feel however you want to feel about the wars were in
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	For him it's about
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,680	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	People seeing
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:14,752	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	What is actually happening when we don't want to
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:17,056	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Let people say in the sacrifices they Boys Town
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It took Todd and his family over a month to decide what to do about those pictures
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:26,016	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Weather in Grant time permission to run the photos or not
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He says ultimately he called Jonathan's mother over for her husband
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,392	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I'm
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,672	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	My wife and I
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	We all discussed it
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And ultimately
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:37,792	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She said no
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And it was a lot of back-and-forth you said no to showing any pictures at all
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Well he can't say no to any pictures because
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,312	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Exactly
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,896	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	He said no to any pictures with the face or identifying marks
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Wish I didn't really that
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Waiting on these pictures to get out
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Prepare that
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Is sisters
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Tell me how to get back to them and
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	That was the big thing
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:06,464	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Adam Anthony belsito shot as her dad I want to protect them
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I'm saying something
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:08,512	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	We decided not to do it
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Time had planned to run a whole photo spread on the Medevac team trying to save Jonathan Taylor's life
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Since they now couldn't use most of those photos
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	They have to make a photo spread more general what had been the basically the death of a soldier ultimately became
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Photo essay on the Medevac team
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And those pictures were maybe
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:38,720	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Two pictures of three pictures in that spread but they were not the focus
EDL	00:26:38,720	00:26:41,024	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Print photo is in the new Sprite because
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	In that photo
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	How you can't see the body
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	For the flag there no identifying marks
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Somehow in that context
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,216	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It's
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It's not got the same in back
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Ridley
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Because you see me after without the before it exactly and Todd showed me
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,272	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Original photo Sprite cuz I had sent that to you
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:04,064	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You know again super on YouTube
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This Is the End
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This is the
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Future they wanted to do
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:09,952	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	See the pictures of someone's Montclair
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This is
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Tumblr layout is going to be
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	29 minutes
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Scrapping it out minute by minute
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This whole process
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,936	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	So there you see all the before pictures
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:20,448	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Lead up to the
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And what seems like if you don't see all that stuff though the wounds in the blood in the tenderness
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	As they tried to comfort him and then the emptiness they feel
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,456	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	When they couldn't save him
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	If you don't seal that
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,064	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You're not really standing with him in that prayer at the end
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,112	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You still seeing him across his face
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The original spread
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You are
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	There in that room
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:46,048	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I did a they did a great job
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You know
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Really powerful
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:50,144	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I couldn't help but think that like
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,216	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Maybe
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:56,288	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	This would have created that conversation that Lindsey talked about
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And how weird and I'm one of the only people
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And to know that like I
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,248	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The only reason I can describe it to you is come on the radio
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You know I will always feel like
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Journalistically
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:16,768	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	We we sacrifice you know we did not tell the story as powerfully as we could have
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	But we had integrity and I feel like we treated everyone with respect and we kept our word
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Lindsay and Todd now stay in touch
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Over email once or twice a year
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And just keeping your word Todd has made a deal with his daughters that they can see the pictures when they turn 21 but interest
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	The three of them don't agree as to whether they want to
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,016	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Paige Mackenzie
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	You are about to turn 21
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:41,344	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Say they don't want to see the picture
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I just couldn't handle it
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:50,816	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Nothing for me I just don't want to see him in pain you know it's Mackenzie
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,120	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Amber him in one piece how he was I'm just
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,912	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She's sensitive
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Bethpage
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,984	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Now Lauren the youngest for me
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,520	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	She said she needs to see this picture
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Because
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I want to know what he went through and
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:05,408	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I like constantly knowing things
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	And I don't like things being kept for me
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I just want to
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	I guess I just want a visual
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It sounds like she says she knows he's gone but she still somehow need to proof
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:19,488	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Not that it happened she knows it happen
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	It's so it feels real
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,416	| radiolab_podcast15sightunseen |	Okay so
