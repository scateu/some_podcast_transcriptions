EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know they joke about this this TV show that they hosted in the 70s
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Courthouse

EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Invent
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They go into this song
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Does this
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Maniacal singing and clapping in Christian is doing this horsey dance
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:19,327	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can you do this before in like why
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	After the third repetition people laugh
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Maybe they get it like oh they can just going to do that and then somewhere around like forever on the 4th time
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's not really not funny
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:40,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Quiet. I'm done with that I'm done I don't want to watch this anymore why are they still doing
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then and then that changes
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Factual hatred
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stupid people you to stupid people but somewhere between like
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	9 + 11
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then they then they're like a like these
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You get this next level which they can't continue
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then they do continue doing it
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You really their eyes are starting to cross
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Dripping sweat christened angry that I've gone that long
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:44,319	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I mean you can hear it in that thing like losing track of the song because he's going to
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Dentist on Tiger Woods today
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I've have Catherine stage whisper
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stop it
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Baby my favorite thing in the history of the world
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What I love about it is
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Your brain is trying to make it into what you wanted to be which is a joke
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:33,215	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But there is no joke happening and sowed what these two people are doing is creating the expectation
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The expectation is going to be broken
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:42,431	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But then breaking that expectation that the expectation is going to be broken by just delivering the thing that they've been delivering over
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	4 and over for the past 10 minutes what's the longest you take it
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	10 minutes
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In Australia
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You were drunk
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:53,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It seems like it seem like 10 minutes at we can't be sure
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You if it was 10 minutes it seems like there's no way 10 minutes 10 minutes
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And the audience
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Crazy

EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I was raised in the bottom in the house set
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Said this couldn't have been that Shall We Begin
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay tell me the beginning How The Story start
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It was odd Christine actually call me Tuesday morning about
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	10
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And just said what are you doing Mom and said oh I'm just going to go out in the yard and do some yard work and run some errands
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How to do the yard work early because
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Going to be hot today
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Now it's wearing in the summertime August 24th and apparently
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What 10 minutes later half hour later
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Cheese
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Said I called her she had left me a voicemail
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Something like
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hey Christine it's Mom something
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Something's not right
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Something's wrong
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I need you to call me back
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So I gave her a call back and
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And she said
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At something about the house isn't right there
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,351	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Things look weird in here
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's weird what what are you talking about
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then she said
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	One looking at the calendar and it says August 2010
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I'm like
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,615	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Aha
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That he's like
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well that's not right and I said
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well yes it is
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	August 24th 2010 and as soon as I said that out loud I grabbed my purse
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Talev
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Oh my God she's had a stroke that was my
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	My my first reaction and
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Oh that makes me feel emotional
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And so
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Christine said she walked out of her house to the car keeping your mom on the phone
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All the while your mom's telling her one thing after another just doesn't look right
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She says there's a strange black
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Truck on the driveway
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which is the truck that belongs to her boyfriend that has been parked there for 10 years
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And of course the increasingly I mean I'm just
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Freaking out at
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So she hangs up with her mom and then calls the paramedics
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And a half hour later Christine
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Arrives at the house
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	By the time I walked in she had been there
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For 5 or 10 minutes at the most
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	As soon as I walked in the doctor greeted me and said
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is her doctor Jonathan Vallejo
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Christine
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's immediately evident
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's not a stroke
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Not an infection that's that's a huge relief but I said
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Your mother has has
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:36,415	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Transient global amnesia Global transient
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'll be honest with you I had no idea what that meant
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I think the word I heard the most was Amnesia your mother has
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Lost her ability
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Forum
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	New memory
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can't remember but
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's not going to last
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Last forever
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It usually last
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Between 1 and 24 hours and we're not sure what
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At this point where the story goes from something kind of frightening
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Something a little more surreal
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah so when I came in mother is sitting up in bed and
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She immediately started asking questions
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tuesday
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	August 24th
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Of course we have a video on YouTube
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	My birthday
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,031	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm trying to remember the last date I remember
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:32,735	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We hung out you came over to my house and we watched a video that I made for you and I was in Texas
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And all your sisters and
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:41,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Your brother said happy birthday to you on the video but we still have the video again but you're going to remember
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They say it's just temporary
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Here at home
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yep you're at home
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Jackson gardening and you called me and you're feeling confused
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Call the paramedics
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I can come and get you
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And we came here
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stepped on you
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:58,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's the date
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	August 24th
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tuesday
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm trying to remember the last
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Read and remember
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You don't remember my birthday
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah couple weeks ago
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Name I missed it but
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This conversation they're having
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just started over
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,423	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Because every 90 seconds Mary Sue's memory reset
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's strange the repetition like we started that last clip you heard with her saying this
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	90 seconds later after her memory reset she says
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Seconds later
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Remember
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:40,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The last
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Read and remember miss you watch this video for a few minutes you realize What's Happening Here is it Mary Sue
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is in a loop
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It goes like this
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	First the date
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's the date
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	August 24th
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She didn't respond
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In almost the same way every time
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:03,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yep
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And every time she says that
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Darn in exactly the same way it was
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fast forward
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If I pass my birthday
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:17,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You must enjoy your birthday quite a bit then she laughs
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,975	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	NBA recap
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You're working in the gardens and you gave me a call I'm just saying it's usually when she says the word paramedic
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,167	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Call the paramedics
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And had them come and pick you up
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Mary Sue's eyes get really wide in this look of sheer
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Butter
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:40,479	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Disbelief isn't that creepy I mean every single time
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Weepy 90 seconds later
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is stomach sleeping
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	90 seconds later
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Repeat itself at this point
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Right after creepy
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pachira sets
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay so I don't know what day it is
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:02,495	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like somebody put it on rewind over and over and over again
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:05,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I had repeated the birthday so much
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That the nurse
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Apparently was behind me now doing the words my birthday
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Groundhog's Day
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We're doing a little yes we do that we have had the same conversation over and over again
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Two and a half hours
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Danny Phantom
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That is what we're talking about today
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What day is it
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tuesday
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	August 24th
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,991	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You didn't miss that you were there
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Watching it
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I wanted to slap me
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I want to bring it out and let me inside
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Damn it I just
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Told you that for the record you would never see my mother. I know she would.
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is a person who's lost
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Commemorate
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But why would her
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Heath
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Once I go to the next piece soap
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Precisely and cancer
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Systole the same
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Exactly the same
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	DIY
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I think what it is is one of the things nurses said
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is that when you have something like this your true self
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Comes out
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Huh
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Your true the word true isn't
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I think so yeah
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Oh yeah I mean I got my mom through and through right there made
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What Christine means is not the repetition
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But their mom keeps asking so many questions just wants to know what's going on with with all
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Across-the-board I love
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Problems I love
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Puzzles
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Are you like a sudoku fiend you know
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I am I am I hate to admit this God
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Iplate escape room games
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	On the internet
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Escape room what are those they're stupid little games where they have little hidden pixels that you find
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,791	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You're you're stuck in a room and you have to get out
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Got to find the key to the door
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And there's all these little
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hidden places is the perfect escape room
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There's a different way of saying this
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:22,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	First of all Jonathan blajos that ER doctor who seen a bunch of these cases
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He said well that Puzzler Instinct that's not just marysue what everybody does
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Struggle over and over again
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Where am I
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And when
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just a brain in survival mode
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And another thing that everybody does
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You see about six of these patients so far is it everybody
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Not just Mary Sue but everybody
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Lee comes a broken record
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,335	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Right down to the
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Phrasing of the sentences
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which keeps them out a little
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Admit you to make sure the brain seemed a little bit more like
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:59,135	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A machine you know you give the machine exact same set of input
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Every 90 seconds given the same doctor the same hospital room
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Steeping machines
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	See if the output never varies and it does
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It almost seems like the patient
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Has no free well
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And so sometimes
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In the back of his head he thinks
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thought if I had that condition at someone videotape me
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I would love to see
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	See my own tape
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Why you know I think
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I want to see
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Could I somehow ask
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or or would I would I end up
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	End up with the rest of us
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:42,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Now thankfully according to Jonathan what normally happens in this condition is that as time goes on. 92nd
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Lutz starts to slowly expand more like 2 minutes
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Soar 3 minutes eventually 4 minutes
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Now it's 5 minutes into a Mary Sue after a few hours at our Loop got longer and longer old memories
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Start to creep back in
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	By that evening she was remembering up until
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like that Sunday
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Few hours later her memory began to extend into Monday morning
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She remembered Monday night
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Finally Shall We Begin
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tell me the beginning
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How The Story start

EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:30,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments of childhood Brilliance basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A kid you know did something
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:54,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Go to radiolab.org brilliance
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Record a short audio message for us
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Again that's radiolab.org / brilliance
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,463	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hey I'm Jenna Radiolab and this hour we're talking about loops loops loops
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nothing
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is 1.0 is the obviously

EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Here's looking at Euclid
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When I was a kid I used to think
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A 06 Tahoe with nothing in it
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But actually zero
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Chosen by the Indians
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's kind of reflecting
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Eternal cycle of the phases of Heaven
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Raymond's
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Greeks and the Jews
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We going to have a zero
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We just had units. Everything started at 1
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	One reason why we didn't
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is that
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm kind of afraid of The Voice
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Afraid of the Void
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How would you describe something
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It isn't there
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nothing
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:38,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There's nothing to say yeah it's an emptiness
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Anna nothing is in a means you're so long you don't even know where you are a psychological
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Barrett's was grasping the zero in India
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Everything and nothing was the same thing that have the first of the fluidity and then growls decided that nothing this was something
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I'm leaving the way they decided to represent the nothing
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What is a piece of nothing and they drew a circle around it which turns the nothing
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,544	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And do something
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,312	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Alexa Loop
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:14,016	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This idea of Eternity in continuity and infinity is actually contained with
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The onion evil
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Cut50
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	My Kind of Love
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	God damn it was actually his
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	One of the most mystical
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Magical
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Parrot show
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:32,192	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Digit of that mole
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We use everyday
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,128	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So here's to other Workhorse
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Next up
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A story from reporter Mark Phillips right
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	As you can see here there
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All these containers
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:50,368	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tape Bluetooth
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay set this up who is this guy
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	His name is William basinski
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He's a musician who makes this
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Really hard to describe music
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm doing it for about 30 years and basically what he does is
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He take a little bit of
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,264	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Classical music or music
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Recorded on tape
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Analog tape
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,896	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Terrible and he looped
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If I can find some
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He cuts the beginning the end keeps it together into a circle brezza through tape machine
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Speed and you get something that sounds like this
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:34,656	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This little phrase that just repeats over and over and over again and never
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Changes oops her everywhere their Cycles there in nature there just universe
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And if you can find a loop that can repeat without becoming redundant
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then you can sort of fall into a different space and time it open
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sort of like a bubble of Eternity or something I don't know
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So that's what that's how
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well in the summer of 2001
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Archiving all these old tape loops
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Transferring them
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	2 digit
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And something kind of weird happened you grab this one piece of tape put it on
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And it was so
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Wonderful grave
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,720	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Very stately
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Lupine
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Totally forgot
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can I set it up and turn down the
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Garnerin
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Left the control room went to the kitchen.
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Coffee
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Came back and
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Started realizing something was changing
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,504	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I love to see that
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The tape was
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:58,368	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Shredding
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The thing to understand about tape
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is that when you record music onto analog tape onto a bit of it
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That music but it is it's
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Iron oxide powder glue
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Did just a piece of plastic
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,984	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So the iron powder is
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:17,568	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Actually the music but after 20-30 years
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The glue loses its strength in the
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,408	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just falls off
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	On the floor
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	His music is actually falling on the floor and I thought of my God was going to happen
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:32,928	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What happened was in the course of about an hour
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The music
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You put more loops on and it kept happening
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But the really interesting thing was
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	While some disintegrated quickly some slowly
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They all sort of had the same
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:48,800	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pattern
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,080	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What do you mean
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just listen to this one
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So this is one of those loops
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:26:00,832	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At the beginning
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And after went around and around 4:20
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Minutes or so the dust are the fall off and then it sounded like this
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:32,576	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All the all the notes are still there
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But the tales are getting shorter
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah and that's what always happens
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sustains and decays of the notes seem to fall away like from the back
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Moving
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Backwards backwards
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:59,200	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It gets shorter and shorter instead of being held for 4 seconds help for 3 seconds
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	2 second
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:08,160	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Finally just really here
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:10,208	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like the attacks in the
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just the beginning for the notes
EDL	00:27:16,096	00:27:17,632	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Only the beginning
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,168	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hold on
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At least for a little while
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thinking wow this is like
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:25,312	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm recording
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The life and death
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Have a melody
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It just made me think of
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Human beings
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How we
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Die
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You can really hear that
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,952	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Disintegration on this particular
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Number 5 it starts sounding like the rest like this
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:54,752	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But after
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just 15 minutes
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Basically completely gone
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,456	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And the tape on this one
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,504	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know tape is normally Brown
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Right now it's
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Clear
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Big Scotch tape
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,184	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The dust is gone
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Little bit of brown here
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,048	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Announce
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,072	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Clear
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,424	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's almost all gone

EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kick in
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Ready
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Born Ready
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,456	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pretty single Navy
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The smell of a dead whale as you have to experience the note to know what it's like it's like nothing I've ever smelled
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Does Craig Smith
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Professor of Ocean Ave
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,696	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Giants really
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Putrid
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Back when Craig was a grudge
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is a 1982
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Putting off the coast of San Diego
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,144	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	About a third of the water was
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:27,936	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Supersonic picking at it
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:29,984	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How big
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,800	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Around 25 to 30 feet long
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So is that like a train car more like a size of a small yacht I guess
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:41,248	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Freaking well I wanted to think that well studied
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:47,136	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What happens when a whale sinks of the seafloor people just speculated about it's anyone ever followed it down to the bottom
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	No one is followed the well down to the bottom
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:57,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So we we told the carcass out to see and they had all these little scraps of Steel
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That they tied to the whale's tail one at a time about 2000 pounds
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nothing
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,336	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It wasn't enough to
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:08,896	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just think the whale whale kept sitting there like Biggs
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Smelly balloon
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Awful decomposition of gas and the captain of the ship goes well
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	IPhone
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,840	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This also doesn't work doesn't really do anything
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Craig try it again and again and eventually
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,704	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Not with that well but with others
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:34,496	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You got to see something
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:36,288	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So cool
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So a whale dies and sinks down into the the dark
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,416	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And and then
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This incredible cycle begins within minutes
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Scavengers will be at the carcass
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They smell within hours but may well have hundreds of hagfish on it
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:14,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They're terrified you like animals
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:20,576	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They have grinding plates instead of teeth and they burrow into the carcass
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hundreds like a hagfish conventions really massive of heels what is that look like well it looks like
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:33,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like I'm a giant Medusa head
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Over the next few days a bunch of other scavengers show up including
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stone crab shrimp feast gud dark station
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,712	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Flash flying everywhere
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:54,112	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sometimes the hagfish get ticked off and they tried to defend their territory very interesting ability to
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Reduce mucus you can put a couple of hagfish into a bucket of water and
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kick it and I can produce enough mucus to essentially turn the bucket of water into
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:10,752	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nothing like gelatin wow just like Medusa head in a cloud of mucus and all that is just the first
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,544	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stage the mobile scavenger stage
EDL	00:32:13,056	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So what happens after that
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well after the mobile scavenger stage
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is Ben Richmond opportunist 8
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,600	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The whale
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:32,000	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is beginning to look pretty dilapidated little bits of
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well soft tissue implanted in the seafloor and so the ground around the whale becomes like
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Start of its own little ecosystem
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:44,288	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A bunch of new animals show up there worms
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Are there really little worms like tons of them we can we can get 30 or 40 thousand of them per square meter
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:57,344	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sometimes the sentiment around a whale fall looks like
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A lot of grass for these worms I just wriggling sticking up out of the settlement and
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Waving back and forth these worms
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tinker White
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:13,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sofia the White Worm like grass
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,080	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Ghostly
EDL	00:33:21,664	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And finally
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Glass stage something we call the sulfur loving stage
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:36,768	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At this point the whale looks like a skeleton
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:39,840	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Covered with this actually beautiful mad of white bacteria
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:41,120	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	5 minutes
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fluffy and just looks like a polar bear's fur
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:46,752	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Covering the bones of the whale
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,264	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:52,896	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Think about a whale skeleton draped in a polar bear fur coat
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:57,248	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sulfur's coming out of the bones and the bacteria or just clustering around
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Picking it up
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	4 years
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When you step back and look at it
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	These dead whales may become like planet and you find creatures living on them
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That you don't find anywhere else
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There now about
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:27,968	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	55 species
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That haven't been found in any other habitats
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Species of animals that only live on well fall
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Does that mean that these creatures
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like the whale is their entire world they don't know anything else
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For some of them yeah
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Where they do
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:45,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The rest of time in this can't happen that often
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's a good question maybe that they are living is what we fugitive species in other words
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Drift around
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Waiting
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can I say hoping
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	4
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And when that happens they grow quickly produce
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:16,096	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hundreds thousands maybe even millions of RV that they then broadcast out into the water column
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:16,864	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The darkness
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Waiting
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Until she will find another such habitat
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:28,384	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hundreds of kilometers away
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And repeat
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:36,832	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So altogether how long can
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can a whale fall last
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,440	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well I well for Ken last
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A large whale skeleton that of a blue large blue whale or fin whale
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,864	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can support a community for 50 to 75 years
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,936	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which really
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Astana de and how does that compare to the lifespan of a whale
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well it's probably pretty comprable actually whales live
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:01,408	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	By the order of
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	5270 years
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:07,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Something kind of poetic about that the idea that you know for the same amount of time that the whale live
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,344	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's going to support this
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Life
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,720	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah it is it is very
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,000	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Appealing
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is Radiolab
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:46,208	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is Radiolab
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Today were talking about loops I'm Robert krulwich run
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,328	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is Radiolab it's all about Luke
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yep I'm Chad, I'm Robert you're listening to Radiolab today were talking about Luke and it's all about
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm jamming Robert like my lips and speaking things that happen over and over and over again
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hello.
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hi Jad paste
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Steve Stephens
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:07,712	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How are you
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:12,576	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How's it going I'm good and Steve told us a story about a mathematical Loop
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:16,160	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The through mathematicians all over the world far
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Story starts way back with a guy named got LOB frigga
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:27,168	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Got La brega how do you spell yeah it's not it's not Gottlieb its it seems to be lob at the end
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,960	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Typo in every book I've ever seen
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:35,104	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Not to set this up very quickly God was a mathematician back in the eighteen seventies and eighties any had a dream
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Mathematics could unlock
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The secrets
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That you could maybe even build a machine beaded some basic mathematical rule
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,064	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And it would just start
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:45,088	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Churning out
EDL	00:37:45,088	00:37:45,856	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Discovery
EDL	00:37:45,856	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When you need a human being that's how powerful he thought math could be a question if math
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,024	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is the most fundamental thing in the universe
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,328	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What is the most fundamental Park
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:59,168	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Map what's at the foundation is it numbers is it
EDL	00:37:59,168	00:38:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In a 1-2-3 that's what you would think
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:04,800	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But God love you said no there's a deeper thing the number
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:07,104	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The deepest thing of all is
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:08,384	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is what today we call Seth
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The set
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:10,944	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Of things
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:11,712	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know so
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:14,272	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yes I like what's a set
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:17,088	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Steve explain it to us using all things
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:18,368	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sesame Street
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:19,904	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Really old episodes
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,440	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Far is it to set it up here at
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Two people working at
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:29,120	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The furry Arms Hotel there's Humphrey who's got a green nose and a pink face and his
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Girlfriend
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I actually know what she
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,704	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She might be his wife Ingrid
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Cancel their hotel

EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Dan Humphrey are taking an order
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Room service order from a room full of penguins
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:47,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know Humphrey says I'll take your order
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,880	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Mr. penguin sir
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Spanish Spanish
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Dan Humphrey said let me check if I got that right
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fish fish fish
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fish fish
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:05,984	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then he calls over to Ingrid he's going to call it in to the kitchen so he tells Ingrid
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:07,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fish fish
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:09,824	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fish fish fish fish fish fish
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:10,848	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Fish fish
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	No that's not right
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Paseo Pointe says A5 times but then
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Journey explained
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Excuse me
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:20,576	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Ingrid and Humphrey
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I have a better way for you to do this
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A better way
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Count the fish
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:32,608	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	6 fish
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:39,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They both realize Ingrid and Humphrey how powerful this is in they say does it work for
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Say cinnamon roll
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Spark plugs
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Absolutely
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's the point that what's cinnamon buns and spark plugs and fish the sets
EDL	00:39:48,480	00:39:51,040	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Have in common is that there are six in each
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:54,368	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I mean if you try to say what is 6 really mean it
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,416	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's the thing that those sets have in common
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	According to Steve it's not so much the number
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sick that's important here again that's the label
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For this characteristic that all these piles seem to share it's the pilot itself the set that is
EDL	00:40:07,680	00:40:11,264	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The most basic things
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:16,128	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Shapes are the Bedrock I've been looking for that we can build the rest of math
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:22,528	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	On top of it yeah and I can make my meth machine that the Universe and I think he published a book sort of shell
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:24,064	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Knowing how this might work
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:27,136	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Except that Russell Bertrand Musselman application
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,672	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then found a
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:30,720	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Devastating Paradox that ended up
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:36,352	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Well annihilating what to do
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:41,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Russell's Paradox is now become known as the barber paradox
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In this case the set is
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:44,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Account
EDL	00:40:44,032	00:40:45,056	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Atomic people
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:49,920	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yep one Barber with the following in this town the barber shaves everyone
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:51,200	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Who doesn't shave himself
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,016	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The bar
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:57,856	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Who doesn't shave himself to some people save himself some people go to the barber
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:41:03,744	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's the universe we're in a town where everyone who doesn't shave himself is shaving by this Barber and now the question is
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:04,768	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Who shaves the barber
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	2
EDL	00:41:08,352	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Remember the barber the barber has the property that he shaves everyone who doesn't shave himself so he can shave himself
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:18,592	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He doesn't shave himself
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:24,992	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then he's one of those people who doesn't shave himself and is therefore shaving by the bar put maybe the barber here's to solutions for you guys
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,040	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Barber cut not shave
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,064	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Could you just not shave
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:34,976	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nino or Maybelline Township maybe he could set up some sort of mechanical device that sort of like one of them
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:41,376	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can't do that you can't change that answer sensibly what happens to the barber and no one has there's nothing to say
EDL	00:41:41,376	00:41:45,216	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Either does or doesn't shave himself by ordinary Aristotelian logic
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Because the barber
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can't shave himself and he can't not shave himself
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,640	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So
EDL	00:41:52,640	00:41:59,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So there's something to it ruined that's what ruined the machine that would solve the universe
EDL	00:41:59,039	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Afternoon to wait for a couple hours like after lunch before you go swimming but I can't see that by overthrowing
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:11,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All lights work but does it does it turns out to be a very very problematic for the foundations
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:12,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The map
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Cuz what does barber paradox
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:16,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The reason was so annoying to mathematicians was that
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Math is supposed to be this logical
EDL	00:42:19,775	00:42:21,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thing right
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:23,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Logic is the lifeblood of Matt and you here
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,895	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You had this little bit of math
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:29,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It was a logical a cell. Contradict contradicting
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:32,063	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Set with Bertrand Russell that I came up with all this
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He didn't lose Faith he's all of this is just a problem with set theory
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So then he spent a long time trying to make
EDL	00:42:37,695	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A theory I think he called it a theory of types
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:41,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Instead of sets
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	These he had certain admission rules that he thought would prevent paradoxes from happening
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Under Bertrand Russell system it was no logical problems no paradoxes
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:59,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Until it's gone evil German guy comes along and you say his name
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I don't speak German but
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Mathematicians often say it like the woman

EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:37,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But he was also maybe
EDL	00:43:37,087	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Little bit off he had real brakes
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Swift you know
EDL	00:43:39,903	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Reality he was
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:43,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In the biography said call him a paranoid schizophrenic
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,279	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But he seems more kind of
EDL	00:43:45,279	00:43:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Obsessive
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Depressive I don't know but
EDL	00:43:50,911	00:43:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But he was in and out of sanatoria and and and he had real difficulties
EDL	00:43:56,031	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Being sure what was real the only reality he really trusted
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:01,663	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	With math circle shapes
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Prime numbers formulas axioms he got into paradoxes
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:10,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Perhaps if the barber paradox the Lord The Men We don't know but he began to think about an actual experiment with
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:11,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Some of these
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Paradoxical loops
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,255	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He took something like the Paradox of the liar
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Turn off the light or says
EDL	00:44:17,791	00:44:19,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This statement is a lie
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This statement is a lie
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Right
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If it's true then it's false
EDL	00:44:25,471	00:44:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And if it's false then it's true
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Statement is a lie
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:30,335	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If you think about that too much
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You might try to cuddle with interested in that phrase and
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For various reasons he took it
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:40,063	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Tweaked a little bit to come up with the following statement
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:43,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Statement is unprovable
EDL	00:44:43,647	00:44:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which is very important to notice if it's
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,207	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If it's provable
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:47,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:51,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's Unforgivable.
EDL	00:44:51,583	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Forget words what would happen if I converted this statement into math
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Because in math things are either provable or unprovable they cannot be both at the same time as other true
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or false if it's true
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Damn it you should be able to prove it yeah so he said I'm going to assign a special number unique number
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:13,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	To make that a purely mathematical statement
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	By coating it in a very clever way into arithmetic
EDL	00:45:16,671	00:45:17,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	To be honest
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Very very clever
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:22,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He did his Matthew stuff
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:27,679	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Had a rigorous mathematical statement right there on the page he looked at it and you realize that what he just
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In math
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:30,495	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is it the following statement
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,263	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,799	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Statement is unprovable
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is it's true
EDL	00:45:35,359	00:45:37,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Because it's actually unprovable meaning
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In math
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:45,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which statement actually is unprovable because it is true the logic of
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:47,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Math will not let you prove that it is
EDL	00:45:47,647	00:45:48,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Trousseau might be true
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:55,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's never know nothing like that is supposed to happen in math things are supposed to be true or not true and you supposed to be able to prove
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Every true thing that stays up
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:59,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If there's something true that you
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:00,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Improve
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:02,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That means that the math
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Strangely
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Alphalete
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's always called his incompleteness the
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:15,807	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's the phrase the Godel incompleteness theorem is that if you have a system of axioms that are
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:17,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Consistent
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Meaning they don't contradict themselves
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They're necessarily incomplete
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:23,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That is there a certain statements you can make
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:26,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Within that system that you can't prove or disprove
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And all of math has this character
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:31,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is the big shock that this is not just about word games about

EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Another word math is shot through and through
EDL	00:46:43,455	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	With these kind of statements that you can't either prove or disprove
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:51,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Seriously the Deep thinkers at the time were amazed at this it was recognized as
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,927	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	One of the great ideas of
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:55,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Of the twentieth century for sure maybe of all time
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Maybe I should make it more concrete there's a question that as far as I know it's still not solved
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:09,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Steve gave us this example of a problem something called gold box
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Conjecture
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:12,383	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kind of gives you a sense of what incompleteness
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Feels like
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So goldbach's conjecture says that you can always right
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:18,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Any even number as a sum of two prime number
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So let me give you some
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:22,367	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That likes a
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	12
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:27,999	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah, remember for sale prime number means you can / 1 and by itself
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:29,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The prime numbers
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:32,607	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	1 and 7 but nothing else
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:35,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All right. Well which isn't even number is 7 + 5

EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,103	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What's 11 + 30
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:45,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,223	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	36
EDL	00:47:48,991	00:47:50,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	19 + 7
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:55,391	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Any even number now this has been checked out to I don't know what billions trillions
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Maybe hundreds of trillions so no one has ever found a counterexample

EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Conjecture and here's the thing
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You might think that either it's true
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or it's false
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:06,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It might be
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:08,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This statement
EDL	00:48:09,471	00:48:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Every
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:13,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Even number is the sum of two prime it might be neither

EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:17,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But what we today call undecidable
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:22,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Undecidable is a term that comes from gradle
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:24,319	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I mean suppose in some
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:26,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Ethereal
EDL	00:48:26,111	00:48:27,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Are transcendental sense
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,159	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like that is
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Suppose that there's God and God knows that this is
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:36,095	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Then you know what about us here among the world of human being
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:38,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All we can do is check each
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:39,679	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Even number
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Every time we check it
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,543	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	True with that that would never constitute a proof
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Because we've never run out of numbers
EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:48,895	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You then say
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You got to understand everything
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:52,991	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You either
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:57,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Have to defer to God who doesn't attend everything if you believe in God but if you don't believe in God
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:00,671	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You didn't have to live with mystery and not knowing
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:04,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's all you can say
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm going to say yes I think you've been capsulated a perfectly and I think that
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Girdle himself
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,679	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Was
EDL	00:49:11,679	00:49:13,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I think a believer in all kinds of mystical things
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:18,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like it's for him this was very freeing and liberating because it meant that there were
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That we couldn't be mechanized
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,431	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There was profound mystery forever

EDL	00:49:28,063	00:49:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm on your team here but me just point on something
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:32,415	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	GoNoodle when he died
EDL	00:49:33,183	00:49:35,743	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He was not exactly liberated he was a paranoid
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:42,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like he thought people trying to poison him he's starving self to that he was exactly liberated but I choose to believe
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:43,935	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It's somewhere in his tortured mind and
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:44,703	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This is my mother
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:45,471	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pretty torture
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,263	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There was a little fellow humming
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:49,055	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The song a song
EDL	00:49:49,055	00:49:49,567	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Liberation

EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thanks to Steve strogatz she has a new book
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Called
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:10,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Infinite Powers how calculus reveals the secrets of the universe
EDL	00:50:10,815	00:50:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And also thanks to Janna Levin her book about doodle is called
EDL	00:50:14,399	00:50:16,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A Madman dreams of Turing machines
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:25,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And finally our last
EDL	00:50:25,151	00:50:30,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Lupe's yeah this one like the last one involves things feeding back on themselves
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kind of
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like a classic positive feedback loop
EDL	00:50:34,111	00:50:40,511	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which is what exactly was like when you can do with audio you take a speaker in a mic you put the feed the sound from the speaker into the mic and
EDL	00:50:40,511	00:50:46,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Speaking into the mic X the most liked and then you get something like
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:49,727	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Painful is painful but
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That kind of feedback loop like in the case of her neck story
EDL	00:50:52,799	00:50:53,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Can also
EDL	00:50:53,823	00:50:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Take the pain away
EDL	00:50:54,847	00:50:55,359	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yes
EDL	00:50:55,871	00:51:01,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Comes to us from this lady I Melanie thernstrom is a writer the author of a book on pain called the
EDL	00:51:01,247	00:51:03,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pain Chronicles which is a book
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:05,855	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That began as a chronicling of her own pain
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:09,439	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which has been suffering from every day for the last 15 years
EDL	00:51:09,951	00:51:10,975	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And what sort of pain
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:13,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Om pain in my neck
EDL	00:51:13,535	00:51:15,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And right shoulder and right side of my head
EDL	00:51:15,839	00:51:16,863	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All at once
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah Yeah Yeahs
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:21,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Start with something that you hid it there how did it start
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:24,543	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It didn't start with an injury of any
EDL	00:51:24,543	00:51:26,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kind but it is Friday discrete
EDL	00:51:26,847	00:51:31,455	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Time goes back to 1997 she was Upstate New York at a country house
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:35,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	On a date with our first date and I wanted to impress him
EDL	00:51:35,039	00:51:37,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So I swam across of
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pond by the mile across
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is this your idea or was it his idea
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:43,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	It was my idea
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Wow that's a different kind of fish that
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:47,327	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And you made it all the way there and back
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:47,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yes
EDL	00:51:48,607	00:51:50,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And nothing happened
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But that night
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:52,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What you got in the bed
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:55,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was kept awake by this strange burning sensation in my
EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Shoulder
EDL	00:51:57,311	00:51:58,591	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Knack
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:51:59,615	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I didn't get that
EDL	00:51:59,615	00:52:00,383	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:01,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Head pain
EDL	00:52:02,175	00:52:02,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like four more years
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:04,735	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And that
EDL	00:52:04,735	00:52:06,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Testicular pain
EDL	00:52:06,015	00:52:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Never went away and got worse
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:08,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Time
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm burning so it's like a nerve a nerve was
EDL	00:52:14,719	00:52:16,255	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Eventually I got an MRI
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Couple years later
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:20,863	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And there was none
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:22,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Impingement knife
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:22,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Binance
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:25,471	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She says she's tried everything
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:25,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Drugs in
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:27,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Physical Therapy shoes
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:31,103	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Distraction like I'll go to a matinee and if it's
EDL	00:52:31,615	00:52:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Scary movie
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:33,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I just don't stay full
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Focus on the pain to distract you can work but then she says as soon as she gets out of the movie
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,063	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Its back
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,343	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And it's angry
EDL	00:52:41,855	00:52:42,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For being ignored
EDL	00:52:44,415	00:52:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sensation
EDL	00:52:45,439	00:52:45,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like that.
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Right
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:48,255	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Side of my head

EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:53,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	React not
EDL	00:52:53,631	00:52:56,703	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Image with kayak frighten me
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:59,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Find it that thought would make the pain worse
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And making the pain worse
EDL	00:53:03,103	00:53:03,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Will
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:06,431	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Inspire further negative fantasy
EDL	00:53:06,431	00:53:08,479	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which will make

EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:23,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And eventually Melanie's the decided okay I'm going to write a book about this
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Do some research
EDL	00:53:25,375	00:53:27,423	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was reading a lot about
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:29,215	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Self-inflicted pain in religious
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,799	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I actually went to witness

EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How to say I'm in Kuala Lumpur
EDL	00:53:36,127	00:53:38,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What she saw a really changed your mind about things
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:41,759	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You can see video of this Festival on YouTube
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:45,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What you see is a dense crowd
EDL	00:53:47,647	00:53:54,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Doing insane acts of devotion literally like
EDL	00:53:54,047	00:53:55,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Read needles through their tongue
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Irritated cheeks
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:53:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Weighted Fish House
EDL	00:53:58,911	00:54:00,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Daniel from their back
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:03,007	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And yet she says when she would look in their faces they seemed
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:04,287	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Relax
EDL	00:54:09,407	00:54:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Really relaxed
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:12,223	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Was it just that they were
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:14,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Already in the pants actually seemed like they weren't
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:17,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	At all
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:18,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I would think
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay
EDL	00:54:19,391	00:54:25,791	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	This person here has a skewer in his mouth
EDL	00:54:25,791	00:54:27,071	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know you can't
EDL	00:54:27,071	00:54:28,095	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Become
EDL	00:54:28,095	00:54:30,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A religious Hindi in order
EDL	00:54:30,655	00:54:32,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	To experience this
EDL	00:54:32,191	00:54:38,591	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Analgesic penerbit like that's cheating but I did feel like okay to one way to describe
EDL	00:54:38,591	00:54:41,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I bet it stays but for every
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:42,175	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Wavy fan
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:42,943	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Describing religion
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:45,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	There's also a way you can
EDL	00:54:45,503	00:54:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Describe things in in scientific terms
EDL	00:54:48,831	00:54:50,879	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And the reality is all of our pain
EDL	00:54:51,391	00:54:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Is in our head
EDL	00:54:52,415	00:54:56,767	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Which means it's this guy this is Sean Mackey chief of the Stanford pain management division
EDL	00:54:56,767	00:55:01,375	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He will tell you that one of the most basic facts about pain is it is not purely physical
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We've got
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Signals coming up from the body they're sending sms
EDL	00:55:05,727	00:55:11,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Like if you whack a toe the signal shoots up some nerves in your leg into your spine and those signals converge Ann Arbor
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:18,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Before you even feel a thing there are multitude of what I refer to as little amplifier throughout our brain
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:20,831	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The turn up and turn down
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:23,135	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The overall pain experience
EDL	00:55:23,135	00:55:25,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Annie's amplifiers are things like your mood
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:27,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Anxiety depression
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:29,535	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Attention expectations all of these things
EDL	00:55:29,535	00:55:33,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Feedback on to that signal coming up from the body and they can either boosted
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:36,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Papa past a certain point where
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:38,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You get a sensation of pain
EDL	00:55:39,775	00:55:42,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Or they can dead nits down down down down down down down down
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Point is pain is a conversation between the brain and the body and Shawn thought
EDL	00:55:50,271	00:55:53,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What would happen if I actually let people
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:54,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	See that
EDL	00:55:55,135	00:55:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Could they
EDL	00:55:56,671	00:56:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Take control of it yes we did a study in Melanie signed up so describe what happens in the six
EDL	00:56:03,071	00:56:04,095	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	If you're putting this
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:05,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	MRI machine
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:08,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We put somebody into a scanner and brain scanner
EDL	00:56:08,447	00:56:09,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And you have a screen in front of
EDL	00:56:09,983	00:56:13,823	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	What you see on the screen is something that normally only the researcher
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:16,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You see your own brain
EDL	00:56:16,639	00:56:22,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	In real-time yeah you're just seeing one p call the anterior cingulate cortex
EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:23,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How many parts of the brain
EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:29,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Respond to pain but that's the one that it's an area that has been shown to be involved with pain perception turning pain
EDL	00:56:29,951	00:56:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Hang up and down it's thought to give
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:32,767	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pain it's emotional
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:34,047	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Bayland it's negative
EDL	00:56:34,559	00:56:40,959	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And you actually see an image of this little piece of your brain right there in front of you on the screen to meet you at your looking at your brain
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:42,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Oh no it's confusing to everybody
EDL	00:56:42,751	00:56:46,591	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So instead we give a visual metaphor EC an image of
EDL	00:56:46,591	00:56:52,735	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm fire plane in a nice case of a cartoon flying but it looks realistic
EDL	00:56:54,015	00:57:00,415	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Flickering flame do they leap into the activation
EDL	00:57:00,415	00:57:02,719	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm there is in that region
EDL	00:57:03,231	00:57:06,303	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Higher than planes go
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:10,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So Melanie is lying in the scanner watching her own pain flames
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:13,471	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And Sean gives her a set of instructions we say okay
EDL	00:57:13,983	00:57:18,079	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	We want you to imagine that you're sitting in a nice warm soothing jacuzzi
EDL	00:57:18,079	00:57:24,479	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know this printing is a warm bath is burning is very relaxing I'm relaxing into it
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:26,527	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I presume it was like
EDL	00:57:31,647	00:57:33,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Before she knew it the Flames were Riley
EDL	00:57:33,951	00:57:35,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay okay
EDL	00:57:36,255	00:57:39,327	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	How about your lying on a beautiful beach
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:39,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yes
EDL	00:57:41,119	00:57:42,399	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know this writing is
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Suntan and the sand is nice and warm and pleasant
EDL	00:57:47,519	00:57:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Angular
EDL	00:57:48,543	00:57:50,591	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Have been in my new bathing suit if I
EDL	00:57:50,591	00:57:52,127	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm getting front like this
EDL	00:57:52,639	00:57:53,151	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Sunburn
EDL	00:57:56,479	00:57:58,271	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And then the flames
EDL	00:57:58,271	00:57:58,783	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kind of go
EDL	00:57:59,551	00:58:00,319	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Crazy
EDL	00:58:00,831	00:58:02,623	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Our thoughts keep slipping out of her control
EDL	00:58:03,647	00:58:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Every time she would see those Flames rise
EDL	00:58:05,951	00:58:09,023	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	To think Ono the Flames are rising which would make them rise
EDL	00:58:09,023	00:58:12,351	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That's even more and then more and more until she had this bonfire on this
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:16,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Screen your immediately struck by they look like the Flames where you're going to
EDL	00:58:16,447	00:58:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Flames were you're burned at the stake
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:19,775	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I've been reading a lot of lies
EDL	00:58:25,407	00:58:25,919	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Negative
EDL	00:58:26,431	00:58:27,967	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And flip it then I started
EDL	00:58:28,479	00:58:31,039	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Trying to move into the idea of being
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:32,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	St. Peter Martyr
EDL	00:58:32,575	00:58:33,855	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	That I
EDL	00:58:33,855	00:58:35,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Believe that I
EDL	00:58:35,647	00:58:36,415	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	With hive
EDL	00:58:36,415	00:58:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Pokemon that I was
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:39,743	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Protected by my faith
EDL	00:58:40,255	00:58:42,303	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And it's Melanie started thinking about this
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:43,839	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She could see the flames
EDL	00:58:43,839	00:58:45,119	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Dying down
EDL	00:58:45,119	00:58:51,263	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Just little bit
EDL	00:58:51,775	00:58:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But you thought okay I'll try this might need
EDL	00:58:55,359	00:58:56,639	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Going in that
EDL	00:58:56,639	00:58:57,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Kind of feeling
EDL	00:58:58,175	00:59:01,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was trying to pick one of the few pairs I
EDL	00:59:01,247	00:59:02,015	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I knew
EDL	00:59:02,015	00:59:03,551	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I mean I I didn't
EDL	00:59:03,551	00:59:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I'm half-jewish
EDL	00:59:05,599	00:59:06,367	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And how Christian
EDL	00:59:07,647	00:59:11,487	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I went through them not settled in until what kind of
EDL	00:59:11,487	00:59:14,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Margaret Atwood
EDL	00:59:14,559	00:59:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You know I start thinking
EDL	00:59:18,143	00:59:21,983	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And if you have to ask him about us
EDL	00:59:21,983	00:59:28,383	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Jewish wedding Kristen and I think about Jewish Martyrs like what prayers do they say she added and revived
EDL	00:59:28,383	00:59:30,687	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Nice details
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	The Flames go down
EDL	00:59:32,479	00:59:36,319	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Okay I'm in the right brain State let me do more of that
EDL	00:59:36,831	00:59:39,647	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	To Melanie finally decided okay I'm going to be this one
EDL	00:59:40,159	00:59:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Particular Jewish Martyrs names
EDL	00:59:42,207	00:59:43,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Eva ben-joseph
EDL	00:59:44,255	00:59:47,583	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	He's burned at the stake by the Romans for teaching the Torah
EDL	00:59:47,583	00:59:53,727	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And this particular Legend. Just as the execution is about to set fire to the logs right underneath his feet Akiva
EDL	00:59:54,239	00:59:55,519	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Stare the Executioner in the eyes
EDL	00:59:56,031	00:59:56,799	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And smile
EDL	00:59:58,079	00:59:59,103	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And the Executioner
EDL	00:59:59,871	01:00:02,431	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Why are you smiling you're about to be burned alive
EDL	01:00:02,943	01:00:03,711	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	A kippah set
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:05,247	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	All my life
EDL	01:00:05,759	01:00:07,295	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When I said those words
EDL	01:00:07,295	01:00:09,087	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	You shall love the Lord
EDL	01:00:09,087	01:00:11,391	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Your God with all your heart with all your soul
EDL	01:00:11,903	01:00:12,671	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I was sad
EDL	01:00:13,439	01:00:14,207	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Cuz I thought
EDL	01:00:14,975	01:00:17,023	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	When should I be able to feel that command
EDL	01:00:17,791	01:00:18,559	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And now
EDL	01:00:18,559	01:00:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	But I'm giving my life and my resolution remains firm
EDL	01:00:23,167	01:00:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Why shouldn't I smile
EDL	01:00:25,727	01:00:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And by the time Melanie had this fantasy buildup in her mind
EDL	01:00:29,311	01:00:30,335	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She looked over at the fair
EDL	01:00:31,359	01:00:31,871	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She noticed
EDL	01:00:32,383	01:00:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	They were almost gone
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:34,687	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	0
EDL	01:00:35,199	01:00:36,223	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	0k
EDL	01:00:36,223	01:00:37,759	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	For the first time
EDL	01:00:38,527	01:00:40,575	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	She taking control of it I felt like
EDL	01:00:41,343	01:00:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Wow
EDL	01:00:42,111	01:00:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	I am
EDL	01:00:43,391	01:00:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Watching my brain
EDL	01:00:45,695	01:00:47,231	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thinking my thoughts
EDL	01:00:47,231	01:00:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I am
EDL	01:00:49,279	01:00:50,815	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Changing my thoughts
EDL	01:00:51,327	01:00:53,631	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	By thinking and watching myself
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	So you are looking at yourself looking at yourself
EDL	01:00:57,215	01:00:58,239	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Looking at yourself
EDL	01:00:58,239	01:00:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Looking at yourself
EDL	01:00:59,007	01:01:05,407	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Yes it's like hearing inside and seeing the ghost in the machine
EDL	01:01:05,407	01:01:07,455	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Step on the moon like I am
EDL	01:01:07,967	01:01:09,503	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Watching my brain
EDL	01:01:10,271	01:01:11,295	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	Thinking my thoughts
EDL	01:01:11,807	01:01:13,599	| radiolab_podcast19loops |	And I am thinking my thoughts
