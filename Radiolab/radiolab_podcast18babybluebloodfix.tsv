EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Down to that Beach
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Because a few weeks
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Earlier alright everybody say something
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hello hello hello Robert my head
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Should have fallen into this Rabbit Hole hello we'd spoken with a guy named Alexis Madrigal
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Who is a staff writer at the Atlantic how did you get on to horseshoe crabs where did that start do
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Late at night I was reading through the site where all these crazy press releases are published called Eureka alert
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,952	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Dot-com
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And I happen to see this really tiny study
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Which had the on promising name
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sublethal behavioral and physiological effects of the biomedical bleeding process on the American horseshoe
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Crab
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Limulus polyphemus
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:28,480	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And I thought this is going to be my big story this and then I went and I did
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:34,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Did that thing that we do now you know horseshoe crab and then Google Images they're on the
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Screen going to Alexis he saw
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	These pictures of a bunch of
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,560	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of propped up on these metal racks
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And they were all kind of
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:44,864	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tied in place
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They are on the row and they all
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:50,240	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Had these thin little plastic tubes coming out of their shells
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All them and underneath them are what look like kind of a 2 liter bottle
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There's blue blood in it
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Blue
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Baby blue blood
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And the strain blood
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It turned out to be the least interesting part of the story like that sound level like it just the visual that draws you in
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Because inside their strange blood
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,448	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The horseshoe crabs have a kind of superpower
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It's one that is help them survive hundreds of millions of years at the Earth is changed
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	As other species have come and gone and

EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	For decades
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Nearly all of modern medicine would not be possible
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Without this
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Special little thing in their blood

EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Still pretty early like maybe six 7 in the morning it was
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,999	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Little bit rainy
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,047	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	When you walked
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Down the beach it was just littered and in probably
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Thousands of horseshoe crab
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah there's no way that
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We just we get a visual like what does a horseshoe crab look like
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like a semicircle and then there's kind of like this French Shield apart and then there's that
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hill and a catcher's mitt
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So there were these hordes of
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Scotland catcher's mitts
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Got laying around and they improve really slowly
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Eliza may be knocked upside down by the waves
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And you could see their soft underbelly that these 10
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,383	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Lobster like legs
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And then walking around them
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Wer
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A bunch of people
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Many of them were from a big pharmaceutical company which will make sense
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A second but my guide for this morning on the beach was a guy named
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Glen Glen Cove short hair while wearing socks in sand
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And I'm the founder and director of the ecologically research and development group
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:16,831	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I think I saw that you were the Airforce I was
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Controller
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And the first time I saw her she cries was in 1969 when I was stationed at Dover Air Force Base
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Being a young guy coming down to the beach
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Looking for something that might be going on and that's all horseshoe crabs it was until many years later that I
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:37,567	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of looped around into this thing but that was the first time I saw the
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Certain kind of weirdly fell in love with them
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And I became really they're like Champion you're not all that attractive
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	She been around in a while I find them quite beautiful
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Glenn now leads is
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know Educational Tours of horseshoe crabs are especially at this time of the year
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And he walked me up and down the beach
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Painstakingly explaining to me the rules of the you know what the sex problem
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The larger ones
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:10,079	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	At one point he pointed out two crabs that were stuck together
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Attached to that female
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That's his gal now locked to one another
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Duck
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tie-down
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Which makes it harder for them to write themselves
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Right now is surf is rough enough
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Off where they were
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There's a good chance
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Would flip them over
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And they be okay
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But because he's
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hanging in there
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The likelihood of that hat
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Becomes more remote
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,607	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But he'll die with her
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Seems like a blockbuster Ronin
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I had to go back to remember
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Burt Lancaster on the beach and I forget what movie that was
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The ways
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You're crashing over and that was symbolic of the romance
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They were both
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Open bathing suits
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Do you know embrace
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sing one another
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Nobody
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So we we've got to go to an animal world version
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:07:59,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	No. Going on
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Glenn's romantic I just painted this
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sex orgy as a beautiful
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Flowering like a meeting season like
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Spring in nature kind of a beautiful thing
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:18,431	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But I'm really really quickly was like

EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The reality of it was kind of horrified
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There be like
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Isles of crabs trying to have sex with each other Big Dreams of them all
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All hooked together
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it would be like going in the wrong direction all the time like
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:44,031	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You'd see like one crab in the middle like a female like a bigger one
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Call stripping and then three or four males like all trying to mate with this one crowd at the same time
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Heading when you look even closer
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It turned out the female crab was dead
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like this weird like
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,255	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Necrophiliac
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	For some of crabs
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was it was pretty
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Raunchy actually
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	My glasses are getting old
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But while I was standing watching all this
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,615	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know hurly-burly of crab sex
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I was struck by what I think is one of the central questions of the story
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Migas
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It's almost impossible not to notice that
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A lot of these horseshoe crabs are really banged up
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:42,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oh yeah I goes right through like chunks of their shells are missing their eyes are missing
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Some of them damn hole that you can see their legs underneath and they're all just fine they just have
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I'm all these kind of crazy
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:10:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What would seem to be fatal injury is but they're all just kind of walking around like it's no big deal
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Just consider it on the species level so it like like yours a creature that has lasted hundreds of Millions
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Games of years it outlasted the dinosaurs and the asteroid that killed them it outlasted freezing ocean
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it's so far has survived the Industrial Age of human
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And you look at in your like
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	How
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What's a secret
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it turns out the part of the answer to that
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Has to do with that
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Baby blue blood
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This is Alexis Madrigal again so our blood is red because
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hemoglobin is rich in iron right and their blood is blue because it's rich in Copper so their molecule that carries
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oxygen for them is called
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hemocyanin but would really interesting about this blood is this chemical system
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A slowing down bacteria
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So say your horseshoe crab and in your blood there's a little bit of bacteria
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Maybe got through the crack in your shell anyway
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In your blood are these
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Shout for the me besides he's oval cells that are turn on patrol in the bloodstream and when they
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:14,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Counter kind of bacteria the amoebocytes
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oval cells excrete this substance called coagulation which does exactly what it sounds like
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Area around where the intruders are just like
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Turns into this like jelly stuff that bacteria that snuck in
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Trapped in a bowl of Jell-O
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Wow
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And a crack in the shell
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Amoebocytes
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Till that off too
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:41,183	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What does it do with a gel that is a poop it out or something
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Then at dinner can actually attack the cells once they've been slow down
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So it it blobs The Invader and then that's it and then some other
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Defense Defenders coming in and take it out take it out
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Superpower fighting its tiny battles in the bodies of you rather plain-looking creatures
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Touch one of these guys before
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	First time how does it feel is the reason why people from pharmaceutical companies were on the beach that day
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Lithia whole life then you have no idea
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Playing out for literally millions of years
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	One day humans started to catch on to this
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	End
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	One human in particular.
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To explain we're going to leave the horseshoe crab just for a minute and talk a little bit about
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Injectable drugs
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That scientist innovator James Cooper
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Any relation to James Fenimore Cooper of like the last of Mohicans
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	He was named after James Fenimore Cooper and his son is also named James Fenimore Cooper
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This James Fenimore Cooper told us that while it was
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Total Miracle when injectable drugs like
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Morphine came onto the scene
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was also
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A bit of a night
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Mare because they didn't know about bacteria
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Occasionally the fluids they were injecting would become contaminated or so does that inject this materials that patients
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Get infections and develop terrible fevers or even die
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They can be incredibly dangerous to us and so to make sure these drugs were free of bacteria that cause fevers
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They didn't just you know try it on a person and see if they died
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They checked it
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Autorabit
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And they would have liked
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like racks and racks of rabbits
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like 24 rabbits in Iraq
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They are restrained even that Loosely mean like a pilgrim being punished in the Town Square exactly right
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:46,367	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Take a little sample of the thing they wanted to inject into a person and then they would inject that into the rabbit
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ear
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:49,439	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And if there's certain kinds of bacteria present
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The rabbits will get a fever
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The temperature will go up and the way they measure their temperature was with these the electric thermometer
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Letters up their bum
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So if the rabbits temperature goes up we know we shouldn't put this drug inside a person
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But if there's no temperature Spike
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This solution is safe to inject into man or woman or children or really anyone so that's how crude it was
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Cast wasn't
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Really that reliable either because rabbits are like pretty sensitive so even if sometimes don't like seeing new person and will gets
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Scared then they'll just have a fever because of that
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So is really it was not a great test not great for us
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Especially not great for the Rapids
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	After they would go through a few Testament even after only one
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,567	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Aegis
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They killed them
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Enter rabbit Hall of Famer
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	James Fenimore Cooper my joke is that I love to talk to rabbits because they're all ears
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Any way back in the late 60s
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Cooper was a grad student at Johns Hopkins University
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The end one day one of his professors came up to him in the in the hall or whatever kind of jokingly maybe someone seriously
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is Cooper if you want to get out of this
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Institution with your degree
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You're going to need to find a way to test for pyrogens
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	By something other than the rabbit basically
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Find a better way that was sort of a joke although I think he meant some of it
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Lucky for Cooper around the same time this other Professor does University dr. Levin
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I just come out with a paper on horseshoe crab blood could theoretically
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,719	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	He used to test for bacteria in
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,231	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	People
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:34,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Hearing doctor 11% about it doctor Cooper sat back in his chair and was like
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:38,495	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What does second what if we use the horseshoe crab blood
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To test our drug
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:47,199	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Would it be possible to enter take this test and adapted to test drug price
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All of those Rapids
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So they got together made the test work
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And as soon as we made that publication in 71
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In the pharmaceutical industry jumped right on it and so this
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Particular
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Chemical substances coagula gin in the horseshoe crab blood actually became
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A major part
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Of the way that we test
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Things that we're going to inject into our body
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And every hospital as you walk down the
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:22,271	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Carter you look in a room that's an IV bag hanging surgical instruments on a tray injectables
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	For pain
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:29,695	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Infections your dad pacemaker cancer chemotherapy your grandma's new hit your kids
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	EpiPen immunization shots
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All of these things have been tested with this
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Material that this tactic were able to do using the time of gold that we
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Extract from horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	450 million year old speech
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah but in order to
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To do all of that in order to actually you know
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Keep our medicine safe
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:07,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They actually have to go out every year and
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And drain horseshoe crab blood seriously
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Best keep doing this out every year
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Crabs every year they drain their blood and then they go put them back out into the ocean like a like a
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like a like a horseshoe crab blood drive
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The whole bunch of companies that do this industry is worth
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:28,831	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tens of millions of dollars

EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	How do they do that
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Back to you
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry

EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	With lots of Nasser reporting on
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The scientist who love them or at least love there
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Very valuable blood
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Maybe them too but mostly black
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And therein lies the rub
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I think four or five companies that go outside horseshoe crabs and then
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Extract their blood
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And wanted to see what what is it look like
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So I sent out a few emails
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And then I was emailing these companies for like 3 years the nobody ever return my emails
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I don't know why maybe they didn't want
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Bad press or I don't need anyone bleeding that year or whatever
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And so I basically given up on the story
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Begin this year
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	These folks at one of the company's culture
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Charles River Laboratories ever like hey why don't you just come down to Charleston South Carolina

EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Vampire
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I don't believe it's like we're sucking their blood
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was a little creepy
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	When
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So lots of flakes
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I feel like when we were in there
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,208	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There's like
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So many we were in the factory dozens and dozens of boxes filled each would like
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	10 huge crabs
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And we
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We are in the yeah I not processing Zone
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And before we went and saw the blood
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This like maybe sound cheesy but it was actually
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Found Anna keep thinking about it
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This there was this moment okay so here we okay what are we looking
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Can I tell when one of the guys in the factory
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I pulled out from these dentist
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Big female horseshoe crab
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Baidu
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And he's just sort of holding her by the shell
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The tail is really coming right at me here
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Her claws are going up and or tails kind of
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Waving around
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Writes a lot of hair
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Exactly and so take these calls
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And he like
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,944	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Turn her over so she's upside down
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And then he took his hand and just let her go
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I was kind of grabbed his hand
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They're sort of pinching my hands here but
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It doesn't hurt that much power to him they're just using that the store to grab the food
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Can I try
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Can I get a little pain
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And so I just
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of slowly
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Stuck my hand out toward her claws
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Are clouds like
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Engulfed my hand
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,384	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Fairy
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,152	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Classy
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It wasn't a Scrabble you kind of like
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Foreign
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Attach the all the claws class
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In unison
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Really tight
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It's actually kind of
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,816	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I thought I am being like this horseshoe crab is
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Holding my hand
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Timmy and of course this is just silly projecting so I'm saying that
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But like it felt like
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it wasn't
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But it felt like a communication like I'm in this
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Enemies
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	People are doing weird things that I want to be back in the city and I'm upside down and I'm about to go into like
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What have a think you know one of those like shower heads
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Braids all up in my undersides and then off to be bungee cord and
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:45,536	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Green like
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was almost it wasn't like it was in pain but I had this almost like
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Primal creature to creature
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Help me
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,544	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah like I mean
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Part of me felt that too
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Me on the other hand
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Did you get to go home
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So the same fisherman
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That bring the craps to us
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Deliver them back to the
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And released their set free
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,208	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Straight back to the wall
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,304	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And how many crabs did they do this to every year
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	About 500 thousand
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Horseshoe crabs every year
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Do the crabs to get blood and then released him and didn't they just swim away fine or some of them
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:33,664	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	After the bleeding there's a small percentage like I think
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The conservative estimates around like 10%
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But that might be a higher estimate or
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Am I get lost
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	15% like 15% so if you're talkin about 500,000
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:48,768	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Crabs
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Divide every year that that that means about
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:53,632	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	75000
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Horseshoe crabs are dying because of bleeding every year
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:03,104	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know they actually is in that original paper that I looked at again Alexis Madrigal they were actually
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	See that a lot of the the crabs don't have
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:07,712	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Blood crabs and non-blood crabs like have slightly different movement patterns and that's because you know maybe one of them is
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Missing 30% of its blood
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But I needed to
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I needed to double-check on that until they did
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	See that the blood animals
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Appear more lethargic they move
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,864	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Marsala
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And like imagine if imagine if you had to go like Harvest deer
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:36,384	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And then believe them of 30% of their blood and then you'd like leave them back out in the forest like there's something about that hands so yeah
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It seems very medieval
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:38,688	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is there any hope
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,272	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I'm getting out of this whole vampire relationship we have with the horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,808	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Well
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Perhaps
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And let me tell you a brief story
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	About a bird
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Smallest bird
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Cinnamon in color
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	With a long bill it's called a redneck
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Incredible thing about red knots is of all the birds in the world
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Red Knot makes one of the longest migration
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Nearly 10000 miles
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,104	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tickle from the very southern tip of South America
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:09,664	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All the way up to northern northern
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,480	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Handed up into the Arctic Circle where they lay their eggs
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And the whole journey
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Takes about 5 months
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And what happens is thousands of these red. Birds will take off from South America to fly like 4000 miles
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Brazil stopped at 4 just like a couple days rest up eat some food
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:33,728	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And then the thousands of them take the skies again and they fly top along the eastern coast of South America over
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Atlantic Ocean before they get to their final messing grounds they make one more stop one pivotal
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,408	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Russo rest stop
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:41,920	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:46,272	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Delaware Bay
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Dried up
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Now when I was in Delaware there weren't like a
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of birds that are but basically these birds when they make this journey they rely on horse
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Because
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,864	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I don't know if you've noticed
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Missing all the eggs
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They need to eat millions of horseshoe crab eggs to complete their migration
EDL	00:31:12,128	00:31:15,200	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And this is the thing it's weirdly these birds
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That might actually free the horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	From us
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah yep
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And to explain I got in touch with this guy my name is j Bolden a biology
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:27,744	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In the global quality Laboratories at Eli Lilly and Company
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So Eli Lilly and Company
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Huge pharmaceutical company that makes
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,120	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know cancer drugs
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:34,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Antidepressants
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A lot of insulin and things like that and real quick people
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Are at the core of our commitment Manufacturing
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Here's a message from executive the driving force behind our innovation
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Radiolab is brought to you by
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,200	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Anyway
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	One of the things that companies been helping innovate is horseshoe crab blood a synthetic version of horseshoe crab blood
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah so you know G
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The problem is there needs to be a supply of horseshoe crab
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:13,568	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know climate change is real
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:16,896	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I could have some supply chain consequences which isn't good
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it was actually all the way back in 1997
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Some researchers
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Out of the University of Singapore cloned

EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Blue blue blue blue
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:35,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Around the bad bacteria and now we can make
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The protein of Interest
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,936	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Instead of getting it directly from horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So why are we already using that
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Will Jay explain that there's a whole bunch of different reasons but one of the big ones was that you already had an industry
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:54,016	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tri built on horseshoe crab blood and so there is no real immediate incentive
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:54,528	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To change
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Which is actually
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	How we get back to
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:01,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The cumin curcumin good friends
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,208	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Buzz
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	So turns out people like these birds a lot like actually way more than horseshoe crab
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Since the birds eat the horseshoe crab eggs their feet is kind of entwined so like the horseshoe crab is not doing
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:21,408	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Well then the birds not going to do well and so why don't I just go around to all the birds
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Conservationists to use some of their political power and contacts and it's only now that we're starting to come up
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,112	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Pain
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:37,024	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A new dawn
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Good afternoon everyone and welcome here is a great place to be today
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:47,264	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	2018 J was standing on a stage along with some conservationists
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Do Nancy Eli Lilly would be one of the first companies to use synthetic horseshoe crab
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The big headline news here
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is it the pharmaceutical industry can actually
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:34:00,064	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Replace probably up to 90%
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:05,184	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Abusive horseshoe crab blood without incurring any major regulatory change
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Which means these horseshoe crabs can finally be freed of their servitude and bondage to mankind
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Can get back to doing
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What is going on
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:27,456	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What they love
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Well
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But here's the weird thing and I think like
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:40,512	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	If the synthetic comes through and we get it perfect and it works and we never have to drain another horseshoe crab then they just because
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,072	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Come these weird kind of sea spiders again
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And I
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I could be
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A really bad thing for them
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,936	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:54,336	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Exactly this is actually something that Alexis Madrigal talks about 2 because most of the other things that these horseshoe crabs have
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ever been used for in the history of their encounter with humans as resulted in the death of like large numbers of them
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Because before we ever valued them for their blood thing one we turn them into a breathalyzer
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ketchum boil them and grind them and then just stick them in the soil as a way of
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Promoting plant growth
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,048	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Or Thing 2
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,072	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We catch him
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Cut them up and use them to like as bait
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To catch more valuable species like a particular kind of snails
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:27,872	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Okay so I have right here in front of me this comes from the Atlantic states marine fisheries Commission
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Which their number save that you know
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	As of the late 90s
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There were nearly 3 million horseshoe crabs being killed every year for commercial fishing
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	3 million wow
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But more recently we put restrictions on how many horseshoe crabs can be used for commercial fishing for bait
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:46,304	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It's even like him a lot of seats at
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Slime to go to a beach and just take a
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:55,520	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know a bunch of horseshoe crabs like in New Jersey if you take a horseshoe crab you could get fined
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	$1,000
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The thing that I've always wanted to keep in mind of this is like
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:05,760	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	If you're going to have to be in a hook up to some economic system which most animals in our world are
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:10,112	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You kind of want to be hooked up to one that that's super high value
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And that doesn't kill you
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is it a fear is if like if the synthetic works and we no longer need horseshoe crabs for their Precious Blood then we just go back
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:25,216	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Back to chopping them up putting them in the ground and using them for bait because they live where we live they live along
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,008	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Populist
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sure
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That right there for the taking
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know they're not
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,152	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Prepared for our murderer simple
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:36,224	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Unlock this

EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Lyft for me
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know like where I realized that
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:50,048	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	As cruel and kind of grizzly as the
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,584	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Draining of the blood
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:52,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Themes
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,168	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I actually may be the best
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Thing for these creatures
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like our
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:36:59,776	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Selfishness
EDL	00:36:59,776	00:37:02,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Maybe protecting them
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This is our very last stop on our trip down to South Carolina and we met this fisherman named Jerry Galt
EDL	00:37:11,552	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Who is employed to collect
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,880	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Horseshoe crabs for the company
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What peaceful little
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,464	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Swear in this Forest
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,232	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah I know this
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This feels like the most secluded place
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	With Jerry walking around this little pond
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,144	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I worthy exactly wrong.
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What's known as the holding Pond where they put the crabs before they go off to the facility
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And while we were down there. There
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:35,616	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Jerry likes
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Poop some water out of the pond
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Best bottled water
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Then he held the bottle up to our faces
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In the movie
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,392	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	All of them

EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	How you went
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:27,840	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	From where your family went from
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:28,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Being
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,376	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of seafood
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,936	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Being a fisherman too
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:33,472	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To doing this kind of
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Crazy different
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:35,776	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Well
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:38,592	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We're just a bunch of Fishman of ADD

EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The gist of it is back when his dad was doing Seafood fishing
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	70
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	His dad was catching a lot of horseshoe crab selling them off for bait and then one day this guy just showed up at his house Suit and Tie
EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Dad did if you would quit selling them for bait
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	You know you make a deal for me you would buy them
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,584	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Buying for more money
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To Jerry's dad said
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We've been doing it ever since

EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:51,615	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I have to admit I've been feeling restless
EDL	00:49:52,895	00:49:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We're not fighting at all
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We're still very much able to make each other laugh
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I feel so big
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:02,111	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Things within me are becoming uneasy
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I mentioned something along the lines of this to Jane about a week ago
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But she assured me it was nothing
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Just physical
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:10,815	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Time to molt
EDL	00:50:11,327	00:50:13,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But the moon proved her wrong

EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Because while the first part is lovely
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There is nothing like the feel of your pedipalp out in the ocean holding onto the edge of Jane's shell with your grippers
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	10000 other crabs clacking so hard around you it's sometimes induces a c Steam
EDL	00:50:39,487	00:50:41,279	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What happens afterwards is
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:43,583	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Unsettling
EDL	00:50:44,863	00:50:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Something strange comes over everybody

EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Okay
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:51:00,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Everybody is lifted from their selves
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Or rather ourselves seem to lift from our bodies and leave us
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We become one
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Without our peculiarities at Giant

EDL	00:51:14,303	00:51:17,375	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Thousands of us thinking into the cool mud all at once
EDL	00:51:17,887	00:51:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Kind of communal dream takes place
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And we awake United

EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Take turns guarding the eggs
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Drop our suspicions of one another
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:30,431	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We are an efficient machine of a species
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Without the drag of the individual
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I think there could be a book in this
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A sort of anti hardening in fetus
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Promise of the commons
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Imagine a completely selfless species what good we could do how quickly we could rise
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But
EDL	00:51:47,839	00:51:48,351	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Alas
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Curse of us creatures unable to change a thing about ourselves since the dinosaurs
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	We can never get this elevated
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:57,823	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	State to last any longer than a couple of weeks
EDL	00:51:58,591	00:52:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It ends instantaneously with the hatch
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Once we've watched as Tiny versions of us
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Smaller than clams with little button tails
EDL	00:52:07,295	00:52:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Disappear into the surf
EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The collective conscious being acidic a
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ourselves float back down into our shells and we feel that familiar itch again of loneliness
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A selfie
EDL	00:52:20,095	00:52:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Confined irrevocably
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To its own body
EDL	00:52:23,679	00:52:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That's when we become assholes again and dick heads
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:28,031	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And self-serious know-it-alls
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And so my hunch
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I tell Jane is that this strange
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Gurgling in my gut
EDL	00:52:34,943	00:52:35,967	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It's some kind of
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Quantum vertigo
EDL	00:52:38,783	00:52:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yeah that's it
EDL	00:52:40,063	00:52:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Quantum vertigo myself longing to be set free Into The Ether where it can
EDL	00:52:45,695	00:52:49,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Leap and spin and do whatever it is self do up there
EDL	00:52:49,791	00:52:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And dastardly old me
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This collection of hard shell and claws
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Desperate
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:56,703	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	To keep it inside
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:52:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But no
EDL	00:53:00,287	00:53:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Jane was right
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was just time to molt

EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I went there with my tail
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:19,487	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Shut up
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	She was about to respond

EDL	00:53:37,151	00:53:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I realized something
EDL	00:53:38,943	00:53:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What timing I said to Jane will have fresh bodies just in time for the spawn pristine

EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was right around then that she started to split
EDL	00:53:59,423	00:54:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Her head started craning forward and iWatch
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Nauseated and thrilled as a bigger
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:07,615	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Wetter version of her began sliding out
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It took hours
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This arduous process of slipping out of yourself
EDL	00:54:14,015	00:54:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But when she finally emerged she was a sight to behold
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Like Jane
EDL	00:54:19,135	00:54:20,927	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But gleaming and massive
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I better go she said
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I know I whispered
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The soft and jelly like new Jane would need to find a secluded place to hide as her cell hardened
EDL	00:54:31,679	00:54:32,959	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Shall I find you in our spot
EDL	00:54:33,983	00:54:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sure she said
EDL	00:54:35,519	00:54:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I began to slowly
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:38,079	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Carefully
EDL	00:54:38,079	00:54:38,591	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Step away
EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:42,175	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I lay down next to her old body in the sand
EDL	00:54:42,943	00:54:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It was almost like laying with her any old day
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That trustee Silence of her listening
EDL	00:54:48,575	00:54:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But with her shell completely empty now
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That familiar pattern of barnacles
EDL	00:54:53,951	00:54:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Took on a frightening weight
EDL	00:54:56,511	00:54:59,327	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Something about them made me feel very worried
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They can tell you what
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:04,703	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Eventually I too found myself splitting
EDL	00:55:05,471	00:55:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It wasn't the easiest of mold so I'll spare you the Gory details but let's just say the old me didn't want to let the new me through
EDL	00:55:11,871	00:55:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it made its reluctance known with a deep gash down my back
EDL	00:55:15,455	00:55:16,735	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	But at last I emerged
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Bloodied and gelatinous
EDL	00:55:19,295	00:55:20,831	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I went to some bushes nearby
EDL	00:55:21,599	00:55:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There I waited as my back began to harden
EDL	00:55:25,695	00:55:28,511	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Through the brambles I had a good view of our old shells
EDL	00:55:29,023	00:55:31,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Lying side-by-side in the sand
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:33,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Two little humps in front of the sea
EDL	00:55:34,399	00:55:35,935	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I gave that ass for hours
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is the moon split across
EDL	00:55:37,983	00:55:38,495	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The sky
EDL	00:55:39,519	00:55:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There was me
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The old me
EDL	00:55:41,823	00:55:45,663	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A shiny little Dome reflecting the moon's journey in miniature
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	There was Jane
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:48,735	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The old Jane
EDL	00:55:48,735	00:55:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A body so carpeted and weeds and Stone
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That she reflected
EDL	00:55:53,855	00:55:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Only us
EDL	00:55:57,695	00:55:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	A week into legs
EDL	00:55:59,231	00:56:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Human ones
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Switching by my brambles
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The rubber pads on it
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Feet make horrible squeaking noises
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I Get Low
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:11,775	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Blackhawk for a moment and then run over to the old Jane in the old me
EDL	00:56:12,799	00:56:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The creature a little one for human Yanks old me by the tail and brings me up
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:18,175	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tithead
EDL	00:56:18,687	00:56:21,503	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	IWatch is it said he's my private Underside
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:24,063	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Then turns me over and places me back down
EDL	00:56:24,063	00:56:26,111	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Thank God right where I have been in the sand
EDL	00:56:26,879	00:56:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It runs its strange hand along my smooth shell
EDL	00:56:30,719	00:56:32,511	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	It turns to examine old Jane
EDL	00:56:33,023	00:56:34,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Her sweet fuzz
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,583	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Are barnacles
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ilife
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:37,887	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Rochelle cracks
EDL	00:56:37,887	00:56:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Under the rubber pad of its
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Butt crack
EDL	00:56:40,447	00:56:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Into a thousand pieces
EDL	00:56:43,263	00:56:46,079	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Little bastard heirs to pick old me up again
EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And all I can do is watch for my brambles as it runs away with me
EDL	00:56:49,919	00:56:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	And it runs away with my past self
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Dragging it ruthlessly
EDL	00:56:53,759	00:56:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Down the shore
EDL	00:56:56,831	00:56:58,367	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The spawn has come and gone
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I looked everywhere for Jane
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:04,255	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Waiting by our spot calling her name into the clacking shells
EDL	00:57:05,023	00:57:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Nothing
EDL	00:57:06,815	00:57:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Now
EDL	00:57:07,839	00:57:09,887	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I spend most evenings underwater with
EDL	00:57:09,887	00:57:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Frank
EDL	00:57:10,911	00:57:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Weird Frank
EDL	00:57:12,191	00:57:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Awaiting her return
EDL	00:57:14,495	00:57:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The fish won't stop nibbling at my molting wound
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I can feel flat worms burrowing into my back
EDL	00:57:21,151	00:57:25,503	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Ask Frank to help me clean it but he spits muscles and tells me I've got to be kidding
EDL	00:57:26,527	00:57:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Michelle is growing itchy with Grit
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I don't know if it's and or Barnacles are what
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	This afternoon
EDL	00:57:34,719	00:57:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I simply stood before the undertow and called her name into its haunting screams
EDL	00:57:40,607	00:57:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Jane
EDL	00:57:43,679	00:57:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Jane
EDL	00:57:47,263	00:57:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tells me to shut up about my starfish novel
EDL	00:57:49,823	00:57:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Everyone does a coming-of-age starfish novel he says I mean write the damn thing if you want
EDL	00:57:54,687	00:57:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Please stop talking about it
EDL	00:57:57,759	00:57:58,783	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	As I sit with him
EDL	00:57:59,295	00:58:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Algae sprouting on my lip
EDL	00:58:01,343	00:58:03,135	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I rethink the value of a self
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Screw the promise of the collective I think sometimes oneself can be a pretty good thing
EDL	00:58:09,535	00:58:11,071	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Self like a Jane
EDL	00:58:11,071	00:58:11,583	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	For instance
EDL	00:58:12,607	00:58:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I keep getting hit with shards of grid that
EDL	00:58:15,679	00:58:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Instead of bouncing off my shell now get caught in my kelp
EDL	00:58:19,007	00:58:19,519	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Tangles
EDL	00:58:20,287	00:58:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I feel sluggish
EDL	00:58:21,823	00:58:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Unwieldy
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	In constant pain
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I think I'm past selves
EDL	00:58:26,943	00:58:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That smooth old me
EDL	00:58:28,735	00:58:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What is a self anyway
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	What endures
EDL	00:58:32,575	00:58:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	With the solo thing of question and my body now long gone
EDL	00:58:37,183	00:58:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Is it even continuous
EDL	00:58:40,511	00:58:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I have the distinct
EDL	00:58:41,535	00:58:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Sense
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The Jane would tell me this is magical thinking
EDL	00:58:44,863	00:58:48,959	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That the old me is off somewhere on the mainland near that little human creature
EDL	00:58:49,727	00:58:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I can picture that clean old Shell of mine drying out near some flower pots
EDL	00:58:54,079	00:58:57,919	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Being occasionally sniffed out by an idiotic canine with a sloppy tongue
EDL	00:58:58,687	00:58:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Yes I'm sure of it
EDL	00:59:00,479	00:59:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	They're Jane with scrunch up all 9 of her eyes and say of course you're sure of it you're making it up
EDL	00:59:06,367	00:59:09,951	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	The old me is preserved in pristine form on the mainland
EDL	00:59:10,719	00:59:13,535	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Well the smashed shards of my sweet old Jane
EDL	00:59:14,047	00:59:16,351	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Encrusted in the very stuff of our love
EDL	00:59:17,119	00:59:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Disintegrate into the sea
EDL	00:59:20,191	00:59:21,727	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Perhaps it's little bits of her
EDL	00:59:22,239	00:59:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That are sticking to me now
EDL	00:59:29,407	00:59:31,199	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Where's my horseshoe crabs
EDL	00:59:31,199	00:59:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Oh that's great
EDL	00:59:33,503	00:59:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	That's really nice

EDL	00:59:37,599	00:59:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Good I'm glad that's lovely
EDL	00:59:42,207	00:59:43,231	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	I I didn't
EDL	00:59:43,231	00:59:43,743	| radiolab_podcast18babybluebloodfix |	Heading home
