EDL	00:00:10,752	00:00:12,800	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Radiolab
EDL	00:00:13,824	00:00:17,664	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	From WNYC
EDL	00:00:18,432	00:00:24,832	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And NPR hey I'm Chatham run this is Radiolab
EDL	00:00:24,832	00:00:25,856	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Cast and
EDL	00:00:26,880	00:00:28,672	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I'm usually want to do today
EDL	00:00:28,672	00:00:31,488	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know what we just did the hour-long show about the
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:32,256	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Ghost
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:38,656	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And in the middle of that show hit on this idea that there are so many of us on the planet now doing so many different things
EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:42,240	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Which affect the air and the water that the creatures on the planet
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:44,800	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Can no longer really
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:48,896	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Uninfluenced by our presence
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:49,920	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Truly Wild
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:53,504	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That made me wonder will
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,576	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	If you want to give the other creatures on earth a little more
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:00:57,344	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Groom-to-be
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:01:00,160	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Be wild and independent than what do we have to give
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:02,976	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	How much are we willing
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To give up to make IHOP
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I don't know these are
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Tough question
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I mean you know when I get it the answer part right so this is John moala I'm John
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:20,128	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I read a book called wild ones and I'm a writer with the New York Times magazine
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:22,688	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And being a writer he told me a story
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:26,528	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	This is a story would shed some light on this question but I think it's
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Sated
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:27,808	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Difficult
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:32,416	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So there was a family of whooping cranes that
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:35,744	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Had been part of the story revolves around a project
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,280	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Create a wild
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,048	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Flock of whooping
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	One of the most spectacular birds in the world 5 foot tall is pitch white thing with black wingtips going to 7 Foot
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,616	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Wingspan beautiful Flyers is Joe Duff I'm the co-founder of operation migration the currency
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Now we've done it story of operation migration before and Radiolab but here's the here's the gist
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:00,576	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	At one point the whooping crane population in North America was down to like
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	15 bird
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	One flock
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:06,976	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	SoJO with a bunch of other folks decided to see if they could start anew
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Flock of crows
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So they raise some cranes in Wisconsin and then they teach them
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	A new migration route
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Florida
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	By leaving there
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	In ultralight airplane Joe in addition to being founder and CEO is also the lead pile
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:24,384	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	How long have you been you been doing this for a while
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:27,456	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I started flying with birds in 93
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:30,784	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	20 years and the key to this whole project
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Joe says
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,600	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Is to eliminate all things human
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	These are wild creatures you know we do this whole thing in full costume so the birds
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Don't hear voices they don't touch
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I don't see buildings or any other human paraphernalia in order to
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,120	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Maintain their Wild
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Still even wears an all white
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,216	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Crane-like costume when he's up there in the ultra
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Feeding the birds
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Come to Florida
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,288	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And when they get the flu
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:58,688	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Florida crane they're supposed to know they're brought to this some chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge it's a coastal wetland
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And it's all a salt marsh in the Tampa area and the birds are put into Squad release Panda Tennessee
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	12 foot high fence is protected by electric wire but the whole complex is not talking at it
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And so on
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	After a while the birds realize they can fly out then they go seek
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Shout their own territories
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It's called a gentle release Into the Wild
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Or
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	The Nights Watch
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And here's where the problem starts it's the winter of 2007 and we got a particular bunch of cranes this
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Family they were called the first family cuz they were the first trains in the population to have a have a chick that they LED South
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Wild hatch migratory whooping crane in the US since the last Nest was reported in 1878
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	These cranes head wound up in on this little subdivision Wetland complex that was surrounded by houses
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It was perfect crane habitat it was it was basically a March
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Just so happened that it was in this
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	This one is backyard
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And so the birds which had been the product of this
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know very intensive effort and tons of money hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour to be wild whooping cranes were now just
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	In our backyard and there was there was free food there she had all these bird feeders whole array of different bird feeders
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Aprender yard and that's not good sign why the why is this a problem
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Well the problem is we're worried that the birds are going to become acclimated to people to be really safe Joseph these bridge should be
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Freedpeople 6mm have been shot
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Hmmm by Vandals
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	636 whooping cranes have been shot
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	In this project by vandals a so what are you doing we asked people to
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Stop timer
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:36,223	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Feeling with jellicoe a reverse phone directory awake give us
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So we tracked the birds are not tracked I said they knew exactly where they where they were and they were able to figure out that the cranes work
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	In the backyard of
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Someone named
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Gibbs
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Clarisse Clarisse
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,791	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Yes Clarice Gibbs
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And you know they knocked on our door in and explains you know the whole engine out to the project and would you please take your
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,727	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Bird feeders down
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And she said she said no
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,567	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	No yeah
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Why don't you say no
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Well done tok
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	The people who went to see her and I didn't say crazy but you got the sense that there was this you know crazy old bird lady lived in this house with wooden
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Not take her feeders down thought you was acting kind of your attic and things just keep getting worse
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Words
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Gone in and put a plastic fence around one of her feeders at 1 playing with it what she thought she had given permission but she had no memory of that
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It got it got better pretty fast and so John decided
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Self for a you know crazy old bird lady who lived in this house
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	But I will but I went to go see her
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know it was a
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	How do I get taco time is it really
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,015	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	The emotional day for me
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Massager under dining room table and she was having a lot of trouble remembering the exact chronology of what happened when
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Cheetah
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know she said excuse me I'm just hard for me to kind of
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Piece things together around that
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Toronto time
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,935	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And and basically the story emerged
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Oh gosh
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,567	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	When we heard that story we decided we needed to talk to Clarice

EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So we called her up out of it
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Kind of the blue and asked if we could record the conversation
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Record we would love to do it

EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It's just
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know it's a peaceful area in birds like things like that they don't like to be alone around a lot of
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Congestion and stuffy nose
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We enjoy them well I say we home
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And my husband and his alive with you know we both enjoyed the birds and
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	This is where the story flip for me because when those conservationists were knocking at clarice's door
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Her husband
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I'm more than 50 years
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	See hear all timers
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	They were sort of hunker down at their house waiting for his
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Bree life to end
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know the Alzheimer's cooking really bad and what they were doing was spending a lot of time on their back porch
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Looking at the birds we would come out here and
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It was Artie or lemonade he would he would just kind of watch
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Our back porch of course faces the lake
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We have a beautiful yard we have oak trees
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And as I'm sitting here talking to you there's all kinds of birds around right now feeding
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We even have sandhill cranes that have to
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Babies with them
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So the reason your husband would be there
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	On the porch and if you had this disease in your family
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know how painful it is because he is her husband
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And he's just disappearing
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	A little bit
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	A little bit more
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,175	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And then he's mostly not there
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	But when a bird
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,991	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Or a bunch of birds
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,271	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Come by the bird feeder
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	From wherever he was
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	He's back
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:09,023	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	As soon as he would spot something needs a baby there it is there's something bird
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And when the whooping crane showed up
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Pekin
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	White
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Wild
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And that would really get his attention cuz they are such big beautiful birds
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know I could see the
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:24,127	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Oh gosh like I happiness in his eyes and
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	He would smile
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Oh
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To me it was like you know he came back to me for a little bit when
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	When he would see things like this it would just
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It would make him so happy and it would make me happy to to see
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	How it affected him
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I'm sorry I just fight
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,727	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I get a kind of choked up when I talk about him
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We were married for 56 years then
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That disease took him in
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It was hard
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	From her point of view is like a miracle to see a bird like that
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And in the way that our husband responded to them and just the other way they that they took his breath away
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	When really you know he wasn't responding to a
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To a lot else in the world
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know when when they seem to recognize things and
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And then you lose them again you know
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,335	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So that's why when the crane people showed up at her door and said please take the bird feeder down
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,871	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	She said
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	No
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You know I left that house
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Just you know I just couldn't figure out how to make sense at all once it once it left
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Have the people who visited her
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Having read your account have they changed their minds at all about
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:44,255	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Her or what they do because
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It's a toughie
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:52,191	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Yeah I'm sure they would still believe that the bird shouldn't have been fed but I don't know if they would be any more sympathy
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Her husband at least Bruce Ali and Ivar the trigger so I told Joe Ferguson story
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	So now what do you say
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Well you know my father died of Alzheimer's so I can respect it exactly what she's going through and how different
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It is however the cost of that is
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	The demise of a bird
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,487	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That that
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Other people have spent a huge amount of time in 24 hours a day 7 days a week for that entire Birds license
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,167	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Let me see year old
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Putting in the wild
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To help save a space but it but if you put yourself in her
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,079	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Shoes she says
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	She by the way
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Was very carefully I was very very emphatically
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That we didn't
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,527	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Mess with the birds because
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I knew they didn't want them being confronted with with people you know they
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Because they are a wild thing and and
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Is it
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Is it to me it is I don't know why we've always loved nature
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We just always loved nature and
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And Wildlife
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	She stayed where
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,287	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	What she felt
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,567	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You'd want her to stay
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	But
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It's a hard one
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To ask the chi
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Give up
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	A glimpse at her husband
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	For the
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Sake of the bird
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Espo's
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,207	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I'm a little more pragmatic than that unfortunately
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You would want you would have him make an exception for her
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Well at the very least I would have him cuz I understand but she's in a new unique
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,263	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Place that he's no I don't think it's Unique
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Well maybe she is in her particulars
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	But
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That is precisely the problem he has to deal with it are people like her she means well we all mean well
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	It's not a case of like
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	People with guns shooting these birds I mean that does happen but I don't think that's the big problem now these are two people who both love the bird book
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Can't agree on something right
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,815	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And he sing in order to love the bird you have to negate
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	You have to just you have to disappear and we can't as human beings
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,775	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We don't seem to be able to do that we all have our own personal
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Requirements and we put those over and above anything else including wildlife and that's why
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Wildlife
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Is this
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Inside peril
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	He's asking her
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	To say goodbye to her husband for the sake
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Of
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	A bird species
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	How do I get to I just worry that if everybody in the world
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Is like her than those birds don't have a chance
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:36,031	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	I would love it if these birds could just exist on their own somewhere and
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:42,431	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Nnnnn in Deepwater marshes where they don't ever encounter people that's never going to happen
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	Just not going to happen
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,319	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	And that's the struggle it's never going to go away you know no matter what
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	What happens if any of these species conservation project
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We're not going to strike some balance wear
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	We never have to think about
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	The power that were exerting in the world this give-and-take. That's what it is
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast14forthebirds |	That's the endgame it's is that forever
