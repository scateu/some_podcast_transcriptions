EDL	00:00:38,656	00:00:40,960	| radiolab041814 |	This just saying you were looking at
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:41,984	| radiolab041814 |	Obviously a very
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:43,008	| radiolab041814 |	Disturbing life
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:46,080	| radiolab041814 |	September 11th 2001 8:46 a.m.
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:51,200	| radiolab041814 |	Has crashed into the World Trade Center we don't know anything more than that we don't
EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:54,272	| radiolab041814 |	This is the day that anyone who is old enough to remember desert
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:56,832	| radiolab041814 |	Remember where we were
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:58,368	| radiolab041814 |	Who we were with
EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:06,048	| radiolab041814 |	And
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,584	| radiolab041814 |	Course
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,888	| radiolab041814 |	We can remember how we felt
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:21,664	| radiolab041814 |	It is the worst attack ever on American soil
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,968	| radiolab041814 |	But
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:29,856	| radiolab041814 |	If you really want understand the world we live in now
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:36,256	| radiolab041814 |	You got a jump ahead one day to September 12th to a corner office in the white house where there's a lawyer sitting
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:42,656	| radiolab041814 |	Computer try to figure out how are we going to declare war
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:49,056	| radiolab041814 |	And one of the things that everybody realizes after sort of an initial discussion is yes we'd like to do
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:55,456	| radiolab041814 |	Declare war but we have no idea upon whom we should declare war that is Gregory Johnson the Michael Hastings now
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:02:01,856	| radiolab041814 |	National Security reporting fellow at BuzzFeed the reason this lawyer by the name of Timothy flan
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:08,256	| radiolab041814 |	The reason Flanagan is sitting at a computer in an office is because been President George Bush had to do something he had to
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:14,656	| radiolab041814 |	You didn't want to act alone you wanted Congressional approval right I mean technically in an emergency
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:21,056	| radiolab041814 |	Can defend the country is the commander-in-chief after all he doesn't have to go to Congress and say hey do I have author
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:27,456	| radiolab041814 |	Relation to use for an emergency that's been with us by the way senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:33,856	| radiolab041814 |	Magician but President Bush needed Congress on his side he felt it was important that we Project Unity
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:40,256	| radiolab041814 |	We're all standing together as one and second if this was an act of war the power to declare war in the car
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:44,608	| radiolab041814 |	Constitution is given to Congress not the executive when Congress declares war
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,936	| radiolab041814 |	Suddenly the president has a very clear and
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,216	| radiolab041814 |	Powerful mandate
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:56,384	| radiolab041814 |	Now the declaration of war is kind of a dead instrument of international law II mean nobody's declared war
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| radiolab041814 |	Since World War II
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:01,504	| radiolab041814 |	But the modern incarnation of the declaration of war
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,040	| radiolab041814 |	Is
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| radiolab041814 |	The authorization to use for
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:08,928	| radiolab041814 |	The authorization to use

EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,375	| radiolab041814 |	In United States history
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,143	| radiolab041814 |	And very
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| radiolab041814 |	Confused
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| radiolab041814 |	What would be the appropriate response
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,847	| radiolab041814 |	So is she and her colleagues read those 60 were
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:18,175	| radiolab041814 |	There was a lot of debate going on back and forth oh yeah
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,455	| radiolab041814 |	Oh yes from everyone
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| radiolab041814 |	Because it's actually wasn't the first rap
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,039	| radiolab041814 |	Flanagan had sent one over the night
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,903	| radiolab041814 |	Before September 12th 2001 and that one was something that almost no one agreed
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,951	| radiolab041814 |	According to Gregory that early draft
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,231	| radiolab041814 |	Had a few extra lines in it
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,511	| radiolab041814 |	One gave the
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| radiolab041814 |	The president
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,047	| radiolab041814 |	The power
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| radiolab041814 |	To preempt
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,631	| radiolab041814 |	Any future acts of aggression against the United
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,959	| radiolab041814 |	Barbara Lee and her colleagues knew that look
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,543	| radiolab041814 |	So many things can be packed into this word
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,055	| radiolab041814 |	Aggression
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| radiolab041814 |	That if we sign on today
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| radiolab041814 |	That if we give the president
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| radiolab041814 |	Does power
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,271	| radiolab041814 |	The president may never have to come back to Congress ever again
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,831	| radiolab041814 |	And request authorization for military force
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,903	| radiolab041814 |	Because he can say that anything is aggression
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,463	| radiolab041814 |	And we're also giving him the power to preamp
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,767	| radiolab041814 |	To the kicked back to the White House Flanagan took out those
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| radiolab041814 |	And now they have this new draft
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,351	| radiolab041814 |	That the president
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,399	| radiolab041814 |	Is authorized to use all net

EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,431	| radiolab041814 |	I said this is too broad let's not
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:27,807	| radiolab041814 |	Definitive is open-ended and I she was speaking this is taking place in the basement of the Capitol building
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:31,647	| radiolab041814 |	She sees some of her Democratic colleagues start to nod
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,439	| radiolab041814 |	People we're not in people were not

EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,975	| radiolab041814 |	Now argue that one of these attacks never even happened
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| radiolab041814 |	Nonetheless President Johnson won
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,279	| radiolab041814 |	Strike Back

EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:40,255	| radiolab041814 |	Now it is the broad language of that.
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:41,023	| radiolab041814 |	Most people believe
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,327	| radiolab041814 |	It opened the door to the worst
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| radiolab041814 |	Part of the Vietnam War
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:51,007	| radiolab041814 |	The Rangers and Marines took casualties mostly from Hitman sniper the thousands
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,407	| radiolab041814 |	Thousands of casualties atrocities
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:03,295	| radiolab041814 |	567 South Vietnamese civilians in March 1968
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:08,671	| radiolab041814 |	And in a television interview in 1969 when President Johnson was as to justify at all
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:16,351	| radiolab041814 |	I can't just blame him in August 1964
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:22,495	| radiolab041814 |	The new whatever maybe next
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:28,895	| radiolab041814 |	To the lessons of Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam that was very much in the air

EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| radiolab041814 |	Barbara Lee stood up
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,183	| radiolab041814 |	Passage where colleagues she was worried about some of the slang

EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:47,327	| radiolab041814 |	So there was a lot of uncertainty about what to do but
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| radiolab041814 |	In the end those concerns were ultimately outweighed
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,911	| radiolab041814 |	Buy another
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:54,239	| radiolab041814 |	We've got to be unified with the present we can't show political division

EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:49,855	| radiolab041814 |	30 minutes or so before the opening
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:52,415	| radiolab041814 |	And so far for 30 minutes she's in the
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,231	| radiolab041814 |	Cathedral about halfway back listening to the Oregon
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| radiolab041814 |	Thinking about
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,351	| radiolab041814 |	The families in those who were
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,703	| radiolab041814 |	There are people around her who are sort of whispering the pain and anguish
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,239	| radiolab041814 |	A few people who are crying
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| radiolab041814 |	I said I got to pray over this
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,383	| radiolab041814 |	And she just wrestling with her boat
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:20,319	| radiolab041814 |	Her heart is say one thing this is too broad and her head is Saint Unity
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,135	| radiolab041814 |	How is it that you can be against the president
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,647	| radiolab041814 |	Does point
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:29,279	| radiolab041814 |	Speaking of the president eventually President Bush
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| radiolab041814 |	Take the podium we are here in the
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,631	| radiolab041814 |	Middle hour of our grief
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,215	| radiolab041814 |	Just three days removed from these events
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| radiolab041814 |	Americans
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,543	| radiolab041814 |	Do not yet have
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:43,103	| radiolab041814 |	The distance of History
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,455	| radiolab041814 |	But our responsibility to history
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| radiolab041814 |	Is already clear
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,343	| radiolab041814 |	To answer these attacks
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,623	| radiolab041814 |	And rid the world of evil
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,183	| radiolab041814 |	And then as soon as President Bush
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,463	| radiolab041814 |	Steps down
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,279	| radiolab041814 |	Everyone in the congregation
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:07,679	| radiolab041814 |	Stands up and they they sing The Battle Hymn
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,191	| radiolab041814 |	Republic
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:14,847	| radiolab041814 |	Which is a very powerful
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,639	| radiolab041814 |	A very moving
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,175	| radiolab041814 |	Piece of music
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:24,063	| radiolab041814 |	But it's not the sort of thing that is typically sung at a memorial service since it's a very
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:28,671	| radiolab041814 |	Forward and almost aggressive sounding was the phrase terrible Swift
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,439	| radiolab041814 |	Sword
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:29,951	| radiolab041814 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,431	| radiolab041814 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| radiolab041814 |	It was
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| radiolab041814 |	Not quite
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,551	| radiolab041814 |	What I expected in a memorial service
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,087	| radiolab041814 |	But
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,135	| radiolab041814 |	The second speaker
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,927	| radiolab041814 |	A reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,207	| radiolab041814 |	Got up
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:05,535	| radiolab041814 |	He gave a reading from Jeremiah 31
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| radiolab041814 |	Israel suffered
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:11,423	| radiolab041814 |	The excruciating pain on
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,727	| radiolab041814 |	Tragedy of militant aggression
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:20,127	| radiolab041814 |	And destruction here in that all over again takes me right back there and I remember
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| radiolab041814 |	Korean drama
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:24,223	| radiolab041814 |	Lamenting and bitter weeping weeping
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,015	| radiolab041814 |	Rachel weeping for her children
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,783	| radiolab041814 |	Weeping
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,319	| radiolab041814 |	For her children
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| radiolab041814 |	When he spoke
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,879	| radiolab041814 |	That's when two men

EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,487	| radiolab041814 |	He started
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,303	| radiolab041814 |	Pray for healing for grief-stricken hot
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:43,167	| radiolab041814 |	For the souls and sacred memory of those
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,447	| radiolab041814 |	Who have been love
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| radiolab041814 |	And

EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:49,920	| radiolab041814 |	Simple word
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:52,992	| radiolab041814 |	It really defined American counter-terrorism
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,528	| radiolab041814 |	More than a decade
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:57,856	| radiolab041814 |	It's called the authorization for use of military force
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,440	| radiolab041814 |	That shorten to aumf and was passed by Congress
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:02,208	| radiolab041814 |	3 days after
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,232	| radiolab041814 |	September 11th
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,024	| radiolab041814 |	Here it is again read by Senator John
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:11,168	| radiolab041814 |	It says the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate Force against those Nations organization

EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:31,392	| radiolab041814 |	By such nations are organizations
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,208	| radiolab041814 |	He seems almost boards saying
EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:35,232	| radiolab041814 |	Yeah he does
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:37,024	| radiolab041814 |	Can I just be honest with you for a second
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:42,400	| radiolab041814 |	I generally move to the world
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| radiolab041814 |	With the
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,216	| radiolab041814 |	Assumption
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,264	| radiolab041814 |	Has been proven over and over again.
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| radiolab041814 |	A truth that I don't know how the world
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:56,224	| radiolab041814 |	Like somehow I missed that day in school or something are you referring something in specific like a general sense
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:00,320	| radiolab041814 |	It somehow like Oz is out there behind the curtain pulling levers and I'm just
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| radiolab041814 |	Always got me stuck on this
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,416	| radiolab041814 |	You know what motivates the show for me
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,720	| radiolab041814 |	I feel kind of stupid most
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,280	| radiolab041814 |	And these shows are a way to engage
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| radiolab041814 |	Examine the word
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,584	| radiolab041814 |	Night
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,912	| radiolab041814 |	And when it comes to these matters of national
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,192	| radiolab041814 |	I really feel
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,704	| radiolab041814 |	Clueless
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,008	| radiolab041814 |	Until when I read Gregory's article
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,080	| radiolab041814 |	I felt like I understood something crucial
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| radiolab041814 |	For the first time
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:26,176	| radiolab041814 |	By the way words actually operates in the world
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:33,344	| radiolab041814 |	Cuz like again this sentence this totally boring sentence this is the legal foundation for everything that the US has done
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:36,160	| radiolab041814 |	Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,696	| radiolab041814 |	The secret Renditions
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:43,840	| radiolab041814 |	To seal rates it's all been hung off the 60 words one lawyer who is in the Bush Administration said look
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,888	| radiolab041814 |	This sentence is like a Christmas tree
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,960	| radiolab041814 |	All sorts of things have been hung off of
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,240	| radiolab041814 |	But how
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| radiolab041814 |	Hotlix
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,568	| radiolab041814 |	Cuz you don't you read the thing and you don't
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,872	| radiolab041814 |	Seeing any mention of
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,920	| radiolab041814 |	Guantanamo Bay in those
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,688	| radiolab041814 |	60 words
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:27:00,736	| radiolab041814 |	Doesn't mention detention
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,016	| radiolab041814 |	It doesn't mention
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:04,320	| radiolab041814 |	Drone strikes it doesn't mention
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,344	| radiolab041814 |	Drone strikes
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,624	| radiolab041814 |	Against American citizen

EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| radiolab041814 |	Recalled to help
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| radiolab041814 |	What's the code this that's
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:15,072	| radiolab041814 |	That's John Bellinger I served as the legal advisor for the Nationals
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:20,192	| radiolab041814 |	Security Council from 2001 to 2005 and as the legal advisor for
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| radiolab041814 |	The Department of State
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,776	| radiolab041814 |	2005 to 2009
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:27,104	| radiolab041814 |	You can't do any speed dating with an E with a credential like that cuz
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:30,944	| radiolab041814 |	The date will be over that's my congressional testimony voice
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:36,320	| radiolab041814 |	Attention isn't anywhere in the sockets how do you read detention from the sick
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| radiolab041814 |	The argument with which I am
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,416	| radiolab041814 |	Purple as a legal matter
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:47,328	| radiolab041814 |	Is this he says if you go eight words into those 60 words and you get to the phrase all necessary and appropriate
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,608	| radiolab041814 |	Appropriate Force
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| radiolab041814 |	Cesarean
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,936	| radiolab041814 |	Does resolve what is force
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,448	| radiolab041814 |	What does that mean
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:58,336	| radiolab041814 |	What are you out if I punch you in the face that's amusing for it that's one kind of morning use forced
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:02,944	| radiolab041814 |	To kill people but a lesser use of force is to detain them
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:05,760	| radiolab041814 |	Detention is simply lesser in
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| radiolab041814 |	Excluded
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,064	| radiolab041814 |	IND use-of-force
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:10,880	| radiolab041814 |	It comes naturally in a military operation
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,904	| radiolab041814 |	It's like a subset
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:18,816	| radiolab041814 |	So if you're authorized to use Force to kill people you are also by default authorized to use Force
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,840	| radiolab041814 |	To detain them
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:24,448	| radiolab041814 |	I sent sheet to knock them out of the battle in other ways than that that forces both
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| radiolab041814 |	Necessary
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| radiolab041814 |	And it's
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,544	| radiolab041814 |	And the courts have upheld that
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,848	| radiolab041814 |	That one Workforce
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,640	| radiolab041814 |	That is how you justifying
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:36,224	| radiolab041814 |	Guantanamo Bay controversy surrounding Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| radiolab041814 |	Continue
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:41,088	| radiolab041814 |	The authorization to use military force act has
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:48,256	| radiolab041814 |	I've been the legal basis for the Detention of thousands of individuals
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:52,352	| radiolab041814 |	Numb about being charged words detention or never mentioned
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:57,472	| radiolab041814 |	Because that's attention if it gets even trickier if you go just a few words
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:59,008	| radiolab041814 |	Past illness is there any pro
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,776	| radiolab041814 |	GeForce
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:03,360	| radiolab041814 |	Do you get to the mention of the enemy who the force is supposed to be
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:06,432	| radiolab041814 |	And it seems to be
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,224	| radiolab041814 |	Very limited language
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,528	| radiolab041814 |	Give me maybe we can shoot everybody
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:15,392	| radiolab041814 |	Body or anybody know only the people who planned authorized committed or aided the Terrace

EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:25,120	| radiolab041814 |	Which is why a lot of congressmen and women voted for it
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| radiolab041814 |	Joe Biden
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:29,216	| radiolab041814 |	On the day of the vote September 14th 2001
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,240	| radiolab041814 |	He says
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,312	| radiolab041814 |	Look people don't freak out about this language
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,360	| radiolab041814 |	Relates to the incident
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,664	| radiolab041814 |	And has broad Authority related incident
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:44,064	| radiolab041814 |	It does not relate to all terrorism every place cuz it just talking about Al-Qaeda who did this and the Taliban who have
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,576	| radiolab041814 |	Harbor Freight
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,368	| radiolab041814 |	Nope
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,184	| radiolab041814 |	Not necessarily
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:53,792	| radiolab041814 |	Gregory Johnson against overtime what happened is there's been this other sort of
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:55,840	| radiolab041814 |	Catch-all category
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:30:02,496	| radiolab041814 |	That has been read into b60 word even though it appears nowhere in these 60 words
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:05,824	| radiolab041814 |	In a catch-all category is associated Force
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:07,104	| radiolab041814 |	Associative
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:11,200	| radiolab041814 |	Yeah what we've been calling me 61st and 62nd
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:18,624	| radiolab041814 |	If you define the enemy as Al-Qaeda the Taliban and Associated forces
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:20,160	| radiolab041814 |	It's a whole different ball game
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:26,560	| radiolab041814 |	So you read those those all those words that did not include the phrase Associated forces is nowhere in the
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| radiolab041814 |	So where does
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:34,240	| radiolab041814 |	So then why could people cite something it isn't in the back during mysteries of a bit
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,032	| radiolab041814 |	So the earliest example that we could
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,800	| radiolab041814 |	Find
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:40,896	| radiolab041814 |	Of those two words is in a 2004 Memo from
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,200	| radiolab041814 |	Deputy secretary of defense Paul wolfowitz
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:47,296	| radiolab041814 |	It defines of Mao Qaeda Taliban and Associated forces
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,064	| radiolab041814 |	The truth is
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,624	| radiolab041814 |	It may have just been there from the beginning
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,440	| radiolab041814 |	Play me is according to Ben Willis
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,000	| radiolab041814 |	From The Brookings institution there is a concept
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,792	| radiolab041814 |	In the laws of war
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:30:59,584	| radiolab041814 |	Called co-belligerent
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,936	| radiolab041814 |	It's the idea that if you're at war with personae
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,544	| radiolab041814 |	And person B is on person is side in the war
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:10,336	| radiolab041814 |	You're also legally at war with
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:10,848	| radiolab041814 |	Person B
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:13,664	| radiolab041814 |	Makes perfect sense if you think of it traditional War
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,224	| radiolab041814 |	We're at war with Germany
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,808	| radiolab041814 |	Italy joins our side so by default we're at war with Italy to write
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,600	| radiolab041814 |	So just transpose out here if we're
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,880	| radiolab041814 |	War with this group called
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:25,440	| radiolab041814 |	Al-Qaeda and a certain set of groups
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,720	| radiolab041814 |	There aren't them
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:31,072	| radiolab041814 |	Join the war on Al-Qaeda side when you are legally at war with them
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,120	| radiolab041814 |	You don't think about that too hard it is
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:33,632	| radiolab041814 |	Crystal clear
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:37,216	| radiolab041814 |	But then the question that has arisen over time
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:39,008	| radiolab041814 |	Is how broad
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:39,776	| radiolab041814 |	Do you make that
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| radiolab041814 |	That Circle
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,336	| radiolab041814 |	Is the problem
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,104	| radiolab041814 |	BECU
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,640	| radiolab041814 |	We're not talking about nation-states any
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,664	| radiolab041814 |	Are we talking about group
EDL	00:31:45,664	00:31:46,944	| radiolab041814 |	So okay
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:53,088	| radiolab041814 |	How close does the linked to Al-Qaeda and the people who carried out September 11th have to be
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:59,232	| radiolab041814 |	So if you have someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who is connected to September 11th is that a no
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| radiolab041814 |	Or is it only three legs
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:03,072	| radiolab041814 |	Or can you be an associate in Minnesota
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:09,216	| radiolab041814 |	Now we can't exactly know how broadly the Obama and Bush administrations have
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:09,984	| radiolab041814 |	Define those words
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,032	| radiolab041814 |	We'll talk about why in a second
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,568	| radiolab041814 |	But you just have to look at the news
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| radiolab041814 |	You could see that
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:18,688	| radiolab041814 |	Like we started with a war that was in Afghanistan and then it spread to
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,712	| radiolab041814 |	Gelato different places
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,736	| radiolab041814 |	Pakistan
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:21,504	| radiolab041814 |	Libya
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:26,880	| radiolab041814 |	Somalia Yemen yeah and there's a lot of debate in a lot of discussion
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,672	| radiolab041814 |	About like is this legal
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:35,072	| radiolab041814 |	Does this have anything to do with September 11th anymore cuz now the group in Yemen al-Qaeda in the Arabian put in
EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:41,472	| radiolab041814 |	And so which is a group that that was first formed in 2009 they have their own hierarchy and their own structure and it's not
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,240	| radiolab041814 |	Not clear
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:43,008	| radiolab041814 |	How
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| radiolab041814 |	In what
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:45,312	| radiolab041814 |	Fashion
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,360	| radiolab041814 |	They take orders
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| radiolab041814 |	From
EDL	00:32:48,128	00:32:51,456	| radiolab041814 |	Either Osama Bin Laden why he was still alive or now I have another one
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:57,856	| radiolab041814 |	So does this make them and Associated force or does it make them part of al-Qaeda
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:33:01,696	| radiolab041814 |	Dancer leaps on
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:03,232	| radiolab041814 |	2011 MKT.
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:09,120	| radiolab041814 |	On your calendar December 30th 2011 seem to be yes when the US assassinated two members of the group
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:15,520	| radiolab041814 |	This is not confirmed yet but they could very well have been a US predator drone strike that is a US government
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:20,896	| radiolab041814 |	Attack to put all this in contact between 2002 and 2014 according to some estimates
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,968	| radiolab041814 |	They're going about 65 drone strikes in Yemen
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,272	| radiolab041814 |	Killing about 400 people
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:29,088	| radiolab041814 |	So much hinges on how you define those
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:31,392	| radiolab041814 |	So much is in the definition
EDL	00:33:31,392	00:33:33,440	| radiolab041814 |	I asked the Pentagon I said
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:34,208	| radiolab041814 |	Who
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:38,560	| radiolab041814 |	What are the list of associated forces to Al-Qaeda yes the u.s. is a war that's clear
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,096	| radiolab041814 |	What about the other
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,376	| radiolab041814 |	Al-shabaab
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:42,144	| radiolab041814 |	Buchheit in Iraq
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,448	| radiolab041814 |	Al-Qaeda in the Islamic maghreb armed Islamic group
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:50,848	| radiolab041814 |	Who are these groups who is the US at war with
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,408	| radiolab041814 |	In the Pentagon emailed me back and they said
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,944	| radiolab041814 |	The list is classified and offer
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,456	| radiolab041814 |	For public release
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,248	| radiolab041814 |	Wait so we
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,808	| radiolab041814 |	Who we are at war with any don't know
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,856	| radiolab041814 |	I see you saying
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:07,488	| radiolab041814 |	When you approached the Pentagon they said that they will not tell you the names of the people were at War again
EDL	00:34:08,256	00:34:09,280	| radiolab041814 |	Well maybe they shouldn't
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,888	| radiolab041814 |	Don't you want to know as a citizen of America
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,704	| radiolab041814 |	Fighting on the other hand do I want to know as
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,800	| radiolab041814 |	If the United States has determined
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,080	| radiolab041814 |	That I am dangerous to it
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,640	| radiolab041814 |	If it announced
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:26,944	| radiolab041814 |	Then that would give me a certain amount of
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:28,992	| radiolab041814 |	Notice
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:32,320	| radiolab041814 |	2D is this advantageous
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:32,832	| radiolab041814 |	United States
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,136	| radiolab041814 |	It could also though
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,440	| radiolab041814 |	Act as a disincentive for you to
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:37,952	| radiolab041814 |	To take action
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:38,976	| radiolab041814 |	Baby
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:41,024	| radiolab041814 |	But maybe not
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,048	| radiolab041814 |	Maybe they will just
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,072	| radiolab041814 |	Quieter
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:43,840	| radiolab041814 |	More dangerous
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,888	| radiolab041814 |	Mystery there might be reasons for
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:50,496	| radiolab041814 |	They have not wanted to provide a public list because they this is John Bellinger again
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,568	| radiolab041814 |	The group's move all the time and so if you say well
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,872	| radiolab041814 |	These were associated groups while then
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:57,152	| radiolab041814 |	Certain people just move
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,432	| radiolab041814 |	Group beta Group B
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,736	| radiolab041814 |	And they also want to leave these different groups guess
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,576	| radiolab041814 |	But it still raises democratic
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,856	| radiolab041814 |	Insurance if the America
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:07,904	| radiolab041814 |	Can people don't really know
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:08,928	| radiolab041814 |	Who the execu
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:12,000	| radiolab041814 |	Git branch believes is covered by the aumf
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:15,072	| radiolab041814 |	In the Democracy in a representative democracy
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:18,912	| radiolab041814 |	That has to be weighed out should the citizens of the United States
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,192	| radiolab041814 |	No
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:26,080	| radiolab041814 |	Who it is that the United States is targeting for Death Around the World who it is that the United States
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,104	| radiolab041814 |	Technically at war with
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:33,504	| radiolab041814 |	Should War be a decision that the citizens of a democracy of a representative democracy have a say it
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:36,320	| radiolab041814 |	Presented rameses you just said so I'm assuming that
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:39,136	| radiolab041814 |	Chairman of the house intelligence committee knows every item on
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:43,488	| radiolab041814 |	I'm not so sure morning everybody today to

EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,264	| radiolab041814 |	So the Department of Defense officials in there were four of them
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,848	| radiolab041814 |	Came and said look I believe that existing

EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:41,344	| radiolab041814 |	This sentence is sufficiently gives us all the power that we need
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:44,672	| radiolab041814 |	And Associated forces are laying out their case
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| radiolab041814 |	They say those two words
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:46,976	| radiolab041814 |	Associated Force
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,000	| radiolab041814 |	Associated Force

EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,080	| radiolab041814 |	Others were like what
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:08,480	| radiolab041814 |	Dylan. I've only been here five months but this is the most astounding and most astoundingly disturbing hearing
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:12,320	| radiolab041814 |	That I've been to since I've been here you guys have essentially Rewritten the Constitution here today

EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:22,048	| radiolab041814 |	18 * in your statement that is not in the aumf
EDL	00:37:23,072	00:37:28,192	| radiolab041814 |	And you said it one point it suits us very well I assume it does suit you very well because you're reading it
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:28,960	| radiolab041814 |	To cover everything
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:34,080	| radiolab041814 |	Who won the most striking moments of this hearing is when the head of the committee
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:37,408	| radiolab041814 |	Senator Carl Levin turns one of the dod officials and asks
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,432	| radiolab041814 |	Is there a list
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:41,760	| radiolab041814 |	Now there's an existing list
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,552	| radiolab041814 |	Two groups that are affiliated with Al-Qaeda
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:51,744	| radiolab041814 |	Senator I'm not sure there's a list per say I am very familiar with the organizations that we do consider
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:57,632	| radiolab041814 |	Right now are affiliated and I could provide you that with yes or we can do
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:00,192	| radiolab041814 |	When you add or subtract names from that list
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,960	| radiolab041814 |	Could you let us know
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:01,984	| radiolab041814 |	We can do that as well mister
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,008	| radiolab041814 |	IQ
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:08,384	| radiolab041814 |	Let me see if I understand what you just said at a Committee hearing
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:13,504	| radiolab041814 |	Say US senator asks specifically so who's on the list of people were allowed to
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:18,368	| radiolab041814 |	That suggested that the Senate armed services committee who had oversight
EDL	00:38:18,880	00:38:20,160	| radiolab041814 |	Really had no idea
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:26,560	| radiolab041814 |	Today's weather like all right if we don't have any idea who were at war with in the Senate armed services committee doesn't seem to have
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:29,120	| radiolab041814 |	And who does
EDL	00:38:29,120	00:38:33,728	| radiolab041814 |	One of the things that became clear to me as I was reporting on this
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:34,496	| radiolab041814 |	Story
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:38,336	| radiolab041814 |	Was that many of the people who are making these decisions
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:40,640	| radiolab041814 |	I never been elected by anyone
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:41,664	| radiolab041814 |	The any position
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:47,296	| radiolab041814 |	And they were the ones who were making the decision not the elected representatives and so who are they
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,184	| radiolab041814 |	I guess so yeah
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:58,048	| radiolab041814 |	So we rooting around for a while looking for an answer to that question until we found this guy
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:04,448	| radiolab041814 |	Daniel kleiman he's a journalist and I've covered National Security and counterterrorism for many years and
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:08,288	| radiolab041814 |	Based on hundreds of confidential interviews that became his book Killer capture
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,336	| radiolab041814 |	He was able to paint a picture for us
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,128	| radiolab041814 |	Who makes these decisions and how
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:14,944	| radiolab041814 |	He told us about these meetings you say it's the s
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:21,088	| radiolab041814 |	TV s meanings what are they who's in the room how did the events unfold these are they they call them
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:24,928	| radiolab041814 |	Civics meetings in the vernacular of
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:27,488	| radiolab041814 |	If your ochracea stands for secure
EDL	00:39:27,488	00:39:28,768	| radiolab041814 |	Video teleconference
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:33,376	| radiolab041814 |	Meetings described them as a sort of a massive top secret Google Hangout
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,424	| radiolab041814 |	Chat with literally hundreds of people
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:37,984	| radiolab041814 |	From throughout the National Security bureaucracy
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,800	| radiolab041814 |	Login to decide who's on the list
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,824	| radiolab041814 |	You should live
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:42,592	| radiolab041814 |	You should die
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:48,992	| radiolab041814 |	You should literally hundreds literally hundreds of people now many of them are backbenchers they're not participate
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:51,296	| radiolab041814 |	Heading out in the call but they're taking notes
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:58,208	| radiolab041814 |	Before they get together in this meeting many the folks at this meeting he says they're giving a little packets of information on each Target they called
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,720	| radiolab041814 |	Baseball
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:02,304	| radiolab041814 |	Sister look like it you got a picture and stats
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:08,704	| radiolab041814 |	Like Yogi Berra on one side and then you got his batting average in his hometown on the back of the terrorist equivalent of
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,496	| radiolab041814 |	Bald actor who is this person
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:15,104	| radiolab041814 |	Where does he Rank and what kinds of operations has he been involved in in the past
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:20,480	| radiolab041814 |	Eventually a general will come on the screen and say here's our Target objective Akron for some reason he says they was
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,528	| radiolab041814 |	For the targets by the name of American cities
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,808	| radiolab041814 |	Subjective Toledo
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:29,952	| radiolab041814 |	General might say Target is an overhead an opportunity to kill this person can we legally do it
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:34,048	| radiolab041814 |	In the fascinating thing although maybe it won't come as much
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:34,816	| radiolab041814 |	Surprises
EDL	00:40:34,816	00:40:35,840	| radiolab041814 |	People he's making this
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:36,608	| radiolab041814 |	Is Pitch 2
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,888	| radiolab041814 |	I got generals but
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:38,656	| radiolab041814 |	Lawyers
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:43,008	| radiolab041814 |	Are lawyers everywhere that is just a basic fact
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:45,056	| radiolab041814 |	Of Modern Warfare says John Bellinger
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:48,384	| radiolab041814 |	You know of lawyers on the ground with artillery units
EDL	00:40:48,384	00:40:49,408	| radiolab041814 |	Tank commander
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:55,040	| radiolab041814 |	Lawyers in Kevlar lures and helicopters are lawyers really almost behind every bomb
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:59,904	| radiolab041814 |	Just lawyers everywhere and that's a very good thing
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:01,440	| radiolab041814 |	That's Harold Koh he was at
EDL	00:41:01,440	00:41:02,976	| radiolab041814 |	The top lawyer at the state department
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,000	| radiolab041814 |	2009 to two
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,328	| radiolab041814 |	Because it means that we're not just
EDL	00:41:07,840	00:41:09,888	| radiolab041814 |	Shooting why people willy-nilly or
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,424	| radiolab041814 |	Because we're angry at them right there
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,472	| radiolab041814 |	Considered careful decision
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:17,312	| radiolab041814 |	No Harold kokori the den clivens reporting was
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,080	| radiolab041814 |	NOC
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:21,152	| radiolab041814 |	Tibbetts meetings and he would often be the one to answer the generals questions
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:22,432	| radiolab041814 |	Can we legally killed
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,480	| radiolab041814 |	So we asked him
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:27,040	| radiolab041814 |	If lawyers are now the ones deciding
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,832	| radiolab041814 |	True we are at war with Who We Are
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:30,624	| radiolab041814 |	How do you do it
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:32,928	| radiolab041814 |	Unfortunately for us
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,952	| radiolab041814 |	I don't think I'm good
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:35,488	| radiolab041814 |	Just call their mother
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:36,256	| radiolab041814 |	Audible methods but I'm
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,328	| radiolab041814 |	He said he couldn't comment on any of
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:40,608	| radiolab041814 |	Classified
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,400	| radiolab041814 |	But
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:43,936	| radiolab041814 |	Coco is a
EDL	00:41:43,936	00:41:46,240	| radiolab041814 |	Creative lawyer 40th and Clive
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,264	| radiolab041814 |	People familiar with
EDL	00:41:47,264	00:41:49,056	| radiolab041814 |	The process code in particular had a
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,080	| radiolab041814 |	A fascinating way
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:52,895	| radiolab041814 |	Determining who is and is not an associate
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:55,967	| radiolab041814 |	Another which we are or aren't at war with
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,503	| radiolab041814 |	And it seems to be less
EDL	00:41:57,503	00:41:59,807	| radiolab041814 |	About the groups as a whole and more about
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,831	| radiolab041814 |	Individuals within the
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:02,367	| radiolab041814 |	For example
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,391	| radiolab041814 |	I see you already
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:07,231	| radiolab041814 |	That was an important issue for Co if you're going to Target a guy he has to be
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:08,511	| radiolab041814 |	A senior member
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:10,047	| radiolab041814 |	A group like Al-Qaeda
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:16,191	| radiolab041814 |	Yes be able to give orders and he has to be unique within the organization you couldn't simply under Harrell Costa Rica
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:19,519	| radiolab041814 |	Go after say a driver or a cook
EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:22,079	| radiolab041814 |	Who was in al-Qaeda or even
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,871	| radiolab041814 |	Foot soldiers
EDL	00:42:24,383	00:42:26,687	| radiolab041814 |	Because they were fungible
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,967	| radiolab041814 |	Meaning they could be easily
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,271	| radiolab041814 |	Another criteria was
EDL	00:42:30,271	00:42:32,063	| radiolab041814 |	Whether they were externally Orion
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:36,415	| radiolab041814 |	Forco if they were just participants in a civil war you couldn't Target
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:38,975	| radiolab041814 |	But if they were targeting westerners
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:40,255	| radiolab041814 |	Or Western interests
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:40,767	| radiolab041814 |	Then yes
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:44,607	| radiolab041814 |	So if you take Dan kleinman's account
EDL	00:42:45,631	00:42:47,167	| radiolab041814 |	Criteria as representative
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:48,959	| radiolab041814 |	And we first have no way of verifying
EDL	00:42:49,727	00:42:52,031	| radiolab041814 |	If you take that as the norm then maybe there is
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:53,055	| radiolab041814 |	Strong wedding
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,615	| radiolab041814 |	But I interviewed
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,407	| radiolab041814 |	Numerous people who
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,687	| radiolab041814 |	Participated in these meeting
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:42:59,711	| radiolab041814 |	Shenzhen one of the things that
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:02,015	| radiolab041814 |	I heard over and over again
EDL	00:43:02,527	00:43:03,551	| radiolab041814 |	Was it there was this
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:04,319	| radiolab041814 |	This kind of
EDL	00:43:04,319	00:43:05,343	| radiolab041814 |	Inexorable
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,879	| radiolab041814 |	Momentum
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:07,903	| radiolab041814 |	Toward killing
EDL	00:43:08,415	00:43:09,439	| radiolab041814 |	And that
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,231	| radiolab041814 |	At the military people in these meetings
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:15,583	| radiolab041814 |	Could speak with a kind of a tone of Do or Die origin see if Act 2 of the people
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,375	| radiolab041814 |	Who I quote in my book
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:19,167	| radiolab041814 |	Used exactly the same metaphor
EDL	00:43:19,679	00:43:20,447	| radiolab041814 |	Describe
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:21,983	| radiolab041814 |	That sense of momentum that was very good
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:23,007	| radiolab041814 |	Ultra zest
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,543	| radiolab041814 |	It was like
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:25,311	| radiolab041814 |	Standing
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:26,847	| radiolab041814 |	Train track with a
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:29,407	| radiolab041814 |	Train hurtling towards Hemet
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,687	| radiolab041814 |	A hundred miles an hour
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,455	| radiolab041814 |	Then I guess like
EDL	00:43:32,991	00:43:36,319	| radiolab041814 |	Play the important question for me is like how often do they say no
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:41,183	| radiolab041814 |	Well you should be 99 * yes and one time now or 50
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:44,511	| radiolab041814 |	2 times yes in 50 times know how many Noah's Ark
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,583	| radiolab041814 |	Well look I'd say I did not come across
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,655	| radiolab041814 |	Many many examples but he did tell us
EDL	00:43:50,655	00:43:51,423	| radiolab041814 |	About this one is
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:52,959	| radiolab041814 |	This is a

EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:00,895	| radiolab041814 |	In the maze
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,455	| radiolab041814 |	And it's extremely clever
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:05,503	| radiolab041814 |	And by the way
EDL	00:52:05,503	00:52:07,551	| radiolab041814 |	It's really well lawyer
EDL	00:52:07,551	00:52:09,855	| radiolab041814 |	Is he announces a set of rules
EDL	00:52:10,367	00:52:16,767	| radiolab041814 |	Going forward for drone strikes strikes to punish individual we act against Harris
EDL	00:52:16,767	00:52:18,559	| radiolab041814 |	Propose a continuing

EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:24,447	| radiolab041814 |	When there's an imminent threat
EDL	00:52:25,471	00:52:26,495	| radiolab041814 |	Consuela understood
EDL	00:52:28,287	00:52:28,799	| radiolab041814 |	Who understands
EDL	00:52:29,311	00:52:32,127	| radiolab041814 |	The fit in the Constitution and also in international law
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:34,943	| radiolab041814 |	President allowed to act unilaterally
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:36,479	| radiolab041814 |	In self-defense
EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:38,527	| radiolab041814 |	When there is an imminent
EDL	00:52:39,039	00:52:39,807	| radiolab041814 |	Threat
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:40,575	| radiolab041814 |	Meeting a surgeon
EDL	00:52:41,087	00:52:42,623	| radiolab041814 |	And you can't feasibly capture that
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:46,463	| radiolab041814 |	Ben fears that what President Obama was doing there
EDL	00:52:46,463	00:52:48,255	| radiolab041814 |	Thereby stressing that word
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,279	| radiolab041814 |	An eminent
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,303	| radiolab041814 |	Threat to the American people
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:52,863	| radiolab041814 |	Is it he was laying a New Foundation
EDL	00:52:54,911	00:52:58,239	| radiolab041814 |	You saying when the aumf and I wanted to end
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:00,543	| radiolab041814 |	I do have another way of justifying
EDL	00:53:00,543	00:53:01,311	| radiolab041814 |	All these things
EDL	00:53:01,311	00:53:02,591	| radiolab041814 |	Maybe they wouldn't change
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:05,151	| radiolab041814 |	The drone strikes in the raids with
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:10,527	| radiolab041814 |	Continue as long as you have a capacious enough understanding of what the word imminent means
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:14,111	| radiolab041814 |	You might be able to continue a whole lot of this stuff
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:21,023	| radiolab041814 |	And then you don't have to go to Congress at all and you can say you've ended the war
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:27,423	| radiolab041814 |	War and the human rights groups will cheer for you and
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:32,799	| radiolab041814 |	We're going to mysterious we find that there are a whole lot of imminent threats for free
EDL	00:53:34,079	00:53:35,615	| radiolab041814 |	Thank you very much everybody God bless you
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:42,015	| radiolab041814 |	May God bless the United States of America
EDL	00:53:42,015	00:53:47,903	| radiolab041814 |	And in the context of what happened to the 60 words you do have to wonder
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:49,951	| radiolab041814 |	What's going to happen to a word like Eminem
EDL	00:53:51,487	00:53:54,559	| radiolab041814 |	And all the while according to been witness and pretty much everyone we spoke with
EDL	00:53:55,327	00:54:01,727	| radiolab041814 |	Haven't really answered the big questions when do we want to attack the enemy who is
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:08,127	| radiolab041814 |	The enemy and if we're going to be fighting them even when we're not technically at war with them and what's
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:09,407	| radiolab041814 |	The difference between War and Peace
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:27,583	| radiolab041814 |	And that's why this whole subject is so unsettling if you don't know
EDL	00:54:29,119	00:54:33,727	| radiolab041814 |	The common sense definition any more of when you're at War and when you're at peace then how do you
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:35,775	| radiolab041814 |	How do you write rules
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:38,847	| radiolab041814 |	Yeah this was an attempt to begin a war
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:43,455	| radiolab041814 |	And so it has the usual beginning quick okay you who are you
EDL	00:54:43,455	00:54:45,247	| radiolab041814 |	Are you out there where
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:49,343	| radiolab041814 |	You for how long till you surrender another not going to like
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:50,367	| radiolab041814 |	All the usual
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:54,975	| radiolab041814 |	A business of warfare is it doesn't apply in this case so they have nothing in the house what do we do
EDL	00:54:57,791	00:54:59,583	| radiolab041814 |	Just like one long improvisation
