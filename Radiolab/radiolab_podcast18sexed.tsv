EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Fun thing that team gonads did in May
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:59,648	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And that is we did a live event on sex ed
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You know if you've been listening to this series we have been looking at the biology of biological sex and sex tutor

EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And one of the things he kept thinking was like
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,168	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Pan
EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Now that we know how complicated it is like how do we teach this stuff
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:18,336	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And how do we teach this
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Staff
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,152	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In a climate where
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	People are really polarized and divided
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And thinking about all this
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Text said it just felt like more than radio story you know if you bring up sex ad with anybody they have store

EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:08,512	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	That is a sentence I never thought I would say
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In the 15 years I've been doing the show I never anticipated this moment where I be on stage
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Thing that you alive
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Group of humans
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,264	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But you know here we are
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,592	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So I actually didn't have sex ed
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So I am looking forward to learning something tonight
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Please welcome to the stage Radiolab Molly Webster
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Hello hello hello hello
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Well this kind of feels like my sex ed class which was like
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like nerve-racking and you're not sure how it's going to go
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So to start the night
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We are going to go down South
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Mississippi
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	2011
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The state
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Passes a law that places some
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Restrictions on sex set
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Notably when it comes to talking about
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Condoms
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The Lofts
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	No instruction or demonstration on that
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So that's
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Sanford Johnson he is a sex educator in Mississippi
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And so on the one hand you might think
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	No big deal right
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Plastic kids can figure out how use it we don't know
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Map to show them everything
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Sanford says
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's not really that easy
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:44,000	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I will tell you a story when I was a high school
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teacher
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Delta
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Because I'm
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The school brought in
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A guest
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Certified sex educator to talk to the kids about sex
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It is stuck with me
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Reset when you make cock
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,384	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Make a call
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,688	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In the time it takes you to drive
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Store
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Really said that
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,600	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In the time it takes you to driver
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Store
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,392	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	To your house
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Aluminum 1/2
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And every time it takes you to take it out of the wrapper and
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Put it all
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Illuminati
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And I was thinking that's how fast work
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Does Sanford and all of his teacher friends were like well if this is what kids are being told maybe we really do need to
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	To do this kind of damage
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Castration
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But the question is
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Surfer stand for this all came to a head
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teacher training
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	He was at so the teacher training was to
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Train teachers
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And how to
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teach sex ed
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And is part of the training
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	One of the teachers was like up in front of the group and she was supposed to explain
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How to use a condo
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Because this is the caveat in the law
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You can talk about a condom
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You can explain or like a show
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How to use one
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Answer this teacher
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So as she talks
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	An SUV
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You couldn't help but ask
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Panama
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Somebody from the state park
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I don't think
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	To do that I really don't
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Talking with your hands
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Was now illegal
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And I got that
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	NSC
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So we thought
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's hilarious yes but it's also like
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You need to tell me
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The kids about condoms we don't really know how to do it
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And just thinking about this the next
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Gay Sanford came up with something
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	That
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I think might be one of my most favorite things on the internet
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Right now
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In the shadows
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	IPhone video in which Sanford Johnson standing there
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I was 1 foot bear
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	While
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	He's holding a white tube socks
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And a sneaker
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And remember
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,687	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	According to Missy
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Mississippi law
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	He's not allowed to
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Perform an act
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What kind of damage
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Castration
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:16,831	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	With a condo
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So what he does he holds
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Does tube socks with Cameron
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	He says
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I want to make sure that you come out
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Cuz I want to make sure there's room for my television
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	When am I
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And all I do is your problem now
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	If you want to roll it
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This video lives on our website and you should absolutely go watch it when you're done with this episode
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This video is delightful but it served a larger purpose for us which is that it reminded us
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	There are a lot of different ways to have conversations about sex
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And the body
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And we thought okay
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What if for our lives show
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We try to reframe the conversations happening around sexy
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What if we use metaphor and euphemism and comedy maybe even a little meditation
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,527	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	As a way to navigate all the stuff
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Swirling around sex ed weather that's a lot in Mississippi or just the general awkwardness that comes with this
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Topic
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So to do this
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	One thing Sanford and sex Educators from all across the country told us was that a key part of
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Assassin classroom
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Was
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Question box where students could drop in anonymous questions

EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So we thought what if we make our own question box
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And try and answer the questions
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	With this reframing
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So we gathered questions from listeners Reddit Sanford

EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:31,743	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's in no way comprehensive but we gave it a try

EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But each month your body tries to
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Push out all that extra tissue that
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Since places

EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This is our live show about sex at
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So far we've talked about condom demos without any condoms
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	.
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:58,528	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We even went on to talk about the deeply important topic of what happens to all the bananas after condom
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Banana demos
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,576	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We ultimately went on
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,648	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	To discuss
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Question that is one of the primary reasons
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I wanted to do this show
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,376	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Annies
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Anythink
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:19,776	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Is there anything off-limits
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What you find is you can get together a room full of people who you think
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:29,760	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Have the same opinion on what should be taught in sex ed in schools
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But once you boil it down to the nitty-gritty and the fine details
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:37,184	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You realize everybody dress a-line
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Somewhere
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Enter wrestle with outline drawing
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We got together a panel of really smart people who think about this
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And we presented them with real-world scenarios we ran into while recording this issue and we tried to have
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Have them do something where they like waved Flags
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	For when they saw the line was crossed or 4 when they supported the line that was being drawn
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'm not sure if the flag thing work too but you may hear reference to it
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:07,648	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And so I would like to welcome to the stage I'm going to move
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Maybe I shouldn't
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'm going to stand here and then milk
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Education historian and author the sex-ed book too hot to handle John Zimmerman
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Muslim youth activist Dahlia
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And sex educator Erica Hart
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Okay so the first one
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,976	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	December 1st 1994
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,304	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Surgeon General Jocelyn elders
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Who is appointed by Bill Clinton
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teaching school children to masturbate as a way of avoiding the spread of AIDS
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	She was asked by
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Dr. Rob Clark a psychologist and a unaids conference about the
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The prospects of a more explicit discussion and promotion of masturbation as a means to limit the spread of the virus
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And she began her reply by saying she's a very strong advocate for sex ed in schools and early age
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Quote as per your specific request in regard to masturbation I think that is something that is part of
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Human sexuality and is something that should be taught
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I think masturbation is really really important
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	That's part of like a sex ed curriculum but for this reason absolutely not
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like she really liked politicize that reason and it was used not for her own sexual benefits but as like
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:42,880	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A way to downplay AIDS and be like this is terrible I don't want anyone to know about this deal with this
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like I don't this seems like
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A red flag to me
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:52,352	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Interesting episode was invented
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Comedian on
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It was cast it was reported as joycelyn Elders saying that she thought that in schools
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teacher should
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,360	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Teach students
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:07,712	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How to masturbate that is not what you were saying
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,808	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What you were saying was masturbation support of human sexuality
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:16,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A people should be informed about that that's very different than saying we're going to teach them
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Which I would then posed to the panel is like would you go as far as doing a how to
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	In a sex ed class
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How to masturbate or do you just introduce it as an idea
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Well we can talk about what if if there's a yes in there I want to know what a gif
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:40,480	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	There's a curious if that's age-related you can't necessarily teach how to and I think also speaking to what you said about
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Jocelyn Elders this is another example of how
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,600	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Race and sexuality gets
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Completed or not necessarily completed but definitely comes to the table is at
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Jocelyn Elders was like literally
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Essentially lost her career talking about this was just shows the
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:30:01,728	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Anti-black origins of ever talking about sex and how our bodies are used in on the lines but when we start talking
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,056	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Timeout ways that we can actually own them is now a problem
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:09,152	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And the other part of that is that you don't necessarily cheap someone
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How to have how to masturbate hashtag Cosmo you can't really do that because
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:16,576	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Everybody has a different
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Body right and everybody's body is function differently
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like for example me I'm a breast cancer survivor I don't have nipples
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,304	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So to be like oh you can stimulate your nipples that would be
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:28,352	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Triggering for me cuz I don't
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Have that body parts that feel good for you like I told my fifth graders
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,008	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Yesterday
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:41,408	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I never like what like what does that mean I'm like any part of your body you could touch in that is called masturbation right
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So now we know what it means and there's not this
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Weird thing around this
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:52,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'm am I doing it right Miss which I get questions about oh yeah am I doing it right it feel good to you
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Yes
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This has been a hugely contested question across American history
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Masturbation
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,680	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Specifically and
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	If you
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	If you don't want to read about masturbation don't study sex education because
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:11,616	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Define it's the most contested subject
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,664	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Explicitly in only about pleasure
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,432	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Right
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's not about procreation
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Even though I expect that many people in this audience think that
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,392	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It sex is for pleasure it's important understand that there are
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Some 330 million Americans
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:32,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Write some of them think that it's only reserved for heterosexual marriage and it's only reserved for procreation
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Discussion
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,568	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I was going to say what's the role that
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,336	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	That
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like religion has Miss coz masturbation is so tightly.
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Hi to you know I was raised Catholic
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Definite No-No right
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:54,624	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It said there's bits so tightly tied to that I wonder
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	How do you respect
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Assertive like religious space when you want to introduce a topic like
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Masturbation
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I mean a lot of my students will say things like well
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	For example God is a man
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:17,408	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And I don't necessarily agree with that but I have to kind of hold space for that that their understanding of it so say
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:21,504	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Same thing with masturbation where it's like I can't masturbate because I'm
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:23,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Christian or I'm Catholic
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Okay so you will not masturbate then
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Still have to talk about masturbation as you are in
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,208	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	My sex ed class
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And that's a topic going to be to talk about it not necessarily not talk about because there's some students who are religious
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:38,656	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So you don't have to opt-in to everything that I'm saying
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's just knowledge for you
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So you don't go around shaving yourself or someone else for engaging in such Behavior
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:50,688	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's really it's really difficult you know I mean there's shockingly little sex at in the sky
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:57,344	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And a lot of reasons for that but one reason is that we differ so fundamentally about sex and sexuality
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Or here in lower Manhattan this is not a representative already
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,280	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And and sexist
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Tide to use a loaded
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:10,400	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Word are most intimate ideas of ourselves as human beings
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And so if you look at
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Western democracies
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:24,992	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What you find is people that objective sex education monster among two groups white Evangelical Christian
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And also recent immigrants
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Especially immigrants from
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You know I mean these are often groups that agree about nothing else
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But in the UK and Sweden and Canada United States
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Every account if they are shared objection
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,192	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Every newspaper account must use the headline
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:50,592	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Strange bedfellows I've never seen a single journalistic account
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	These are people that basically group that nothing including immigration
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:59,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Write up this is hard and it should be hard for people like myself on the left because we say we value diversity
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:02,368	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But we also want this thing called comprehensive sex education
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:04,160	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Square that Circle
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You're not into anything
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:10,816	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Yeah so I was raised Muslim and I think it's not
EDL	00:34:10,816	00:34:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Don't teach your kids about sex it's more of us an unspoken heterosexual we use it to procreate
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Safeway and I hate like feeding into this like American narrative like Muslims are like all straight cisheterosexual
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What are Generations coming and we're like all clear and whatnot but
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:35,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's hard to navigate
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Sex in general let alone masturbation because there is a stigma that's tied not just within the religion but within our own communities
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,936	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Okay so this one
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What happened at
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Charter School Rocklin California
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So a kindergarten class
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Student can bring it a book
EDL	00:34:56,640	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Can a book have you read during story time
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And so for one of the week
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:04,576	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A transgender student brought in a book called I am jazz
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Is a book about a transgender
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,720	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The teacher read the book in class
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And then
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	There was a really interesting reaction from the parent
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:23,008	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like a holy crap while we were not prepared for this our kids came home with
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Very confused and tons of questions
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And I thought this was an interesting one because a lot of what we've been talking about a serf formalize sex ed
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And this is informal sex at
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Informal per say I mean it's just about
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,184	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A person's experience and what
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Cisnormativity does which assist meaning like
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The world is very stiff
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Gender dominance
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Is like
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This is weird now we're going to maybe we should have had a letter about this even need a letter about talking
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	About George Washington
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Or the Civil War
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Or the Vietnam War or World War so why is it that we are talking about
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:05,248	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Trans person that now you need to be warned
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	That you're going to talk about this
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:09,856	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Tell you what about you I know we were talking backstage you said
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You could go either way on this
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Yeah because my only saying my only qualm is like says people don't know how to facilitate discussion support under with their kids
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:20,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Especially if your kindergarten
EDL	00:36:20,608	00:36:24,960	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	My boy my girl like these questions that you said this yard to ask so I can wish that
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,288	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The parents knew about it justly be able to facilitate evaporation
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It would have been like a productive experience for the kindergarten
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	A letter like if
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'm kind of like a letter
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:43,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So that way they would have been able to know about this beforehand so like the kid wouldn't come in at like 4 p.m. to be like I don't know what's happening this is what happened at school
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You about it beforehand I feel like it could have been a more productive conversation
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,072	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Look it's really hard
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:57,216	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I share the sentiments that we just heard about cisnormativity and I'm deeply support of a trans rights
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:37:02,592	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But I'm also supported the public schools and I understand they are under threat
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:08,736	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	All right and I think that there's a really delicate balance here if you want people to support your public
EDL	00:37:08,736	00:37:09,248	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Schools UK
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:14,112	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	At the same time transmit the message it's somehow
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	They just didn't get this thing this sex
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Sting right and weed school have to intervene
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	There is a fear I mean I think and what you were saying there's a centering of institutions in this country
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:32,544	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	It's like up the institution needs to be upheld like don't mess up the school the school is going to fall apart
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And if the school for the part that we have nothing rather than centering the most marginalized
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And I think
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	To think
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Combat a school is going to fall apart but not
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Trans folks and non-binary people and genderqueer people. Think about their experience
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,696	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Is is
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	My mind f***
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	For lack of better words I think
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:56,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What is missing in sex education is talking about
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:59,936	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Intersectionality which is not just a celebration of
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:04,032	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Various identities were talking about the ways in which people are impacted
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:06,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Systems of Oppression
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:12,480	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So actually talking about that when you talk about masturbation is this really something that someone has access to if you're talkin about
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:16,832	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Putting on a condom why is it that Mississippi the poorest country in this country
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Have no what cannot talk about condoms
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:26,304	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Like that is really a function of race and class right and really being mindful of that really bringing that into your
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,584	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Classrooms of people
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Don't necessarily do that they're like up let's just talk about sex and let's just have this conversation and be mindful
EDL	00:38:33,984	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Of the things in which like people are also bringing to the table yet John
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	An honest intersectional approach would also acknowledge
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:47,552	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Seems anathema
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,856	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Don't think they belong to the public school
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Believe that their familial and religious matters and not school matter
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'm not saying I agree with them
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I am saying though that an honest intersectional approach
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Would have to acknowledge that would have to take
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Account of the fact
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:10,080	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We are a diverse society and many of our recent immigrants not all
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But many
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,432	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Find these themes inappropriate for a public
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	What I said I said it matters that you actually talk about where people are
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You actually get interested and if someone is dealing with
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,696	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Being documented they probably don't want to talk about masturbation
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:32,608	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	As the conversation went on I wouldn't say that we ever actually came to a consensus on any single cell
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Scenario
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	You can feel it gets torn
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	But what was brought into the room all of the different things that go
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:45,664	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Into thinking about how lines are drawn insects said so race immigration class maturity
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Body type
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:52,576	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We went on to discuss other scenario some of my favorites are
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Bondage and 9th
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Introducing bondage to 9th graders
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	12th grade or live
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	BDSM demonstrations
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,048	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Attendees were
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Five 2 because yes that has actually happened on a college campus somewhere
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	We aren't able to play all those for you
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:16,896	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Here on this podcast but we are going to do is play you the final segment
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Of the night
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:22,016	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Which is a batch of questions
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:22,784	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	From

EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	I'll just do a little thing
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	So last week we heard
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	About the sex educator
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:47,872	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Who made
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	An amazing discovery
EDL	00:40:49,920	00:40:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	This educator is teaching a workshop at a middle school in Southern Maine
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,808	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And they were talking to the school nurse
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And as they talk they saw that on the nurse's desk there was just like
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:02,208	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Overflowing
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Envelope
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	At she asked what it was
EDL	00:41:06,816	00:41:08,096	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And it turns out
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	The nurse said oh those are my fifth graders
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,496	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	And so we obviously were like we want those
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:17,312	| radiolab_podcast18sexed |	Thank you very much for telling us the story
