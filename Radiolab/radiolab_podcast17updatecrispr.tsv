EDL	00:00:06,912	00:00:10,752	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,264	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:25,600	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let me tell you there is nothing like the she relation of Discovery I think you know that this is the end of malaria this is the end of everything else
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:32,000	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Mosquitoes spread wait a minute you know ticks spread Lyme disease we can probably get rid of that too I thought in the morning
EDL	00:00:32,000	00:00:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Singing to the turtles in the in the parking
EDL	00:00:34,816	00:00:38,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pretty much and I got myself a full day of being who
EDL	00:00:39,168	00:00:39,680	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then I
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:41,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But but
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:42,752	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But
EDL	00:00:43,776	00:00:45,056	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What if something goes
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Wrong
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm Jenna boom Radiolab and the guy they just heard is Kevin esvelt he's a scientist
EDL	00:00:54,272	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You talkin to a producers
EDL	00:00:55,552	00:00:58,112	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Soren wheeler and Molly Webster about
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:03,232	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr when she's at a technology cheese and you it's a gene editing technology
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Tok can we shape
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:05,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Life
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah we ended up doing an entire show about
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:14,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And we called it a antibodies part 1 river that there was going to be a part 2
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's weird name that it's like telling someone you got them a birthday present but you haven't yet
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We should just own up
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Radiolab listeners we did not
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Liplicious listen
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:31,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Texting me know we ment to we meant to have a part 2
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:33,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But you know we're doing a story
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It fell apart his workout
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sucked frankly and we thought I was going to Astoria
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Turn turn out to be stored at now we have what we're going to do is we're going to
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pay you what your Jill the part 2
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,008	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah this is the part 2 finally
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Part 2 because
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr in the time that we did the thing till now
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Has gone banana crazy everyday in the science
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:59,040	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Action which I know we all read religious
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Be there is a crisper thing I started we're going to play you the original piece
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:06,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For those of you who never heard it
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:10,048	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Justice reset the Baseline and then we're going to come back and tell you all this stuff
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It happened since you
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,400	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There is only explain DIY got
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Got started with this
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,776	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You were some kind of an affair to tell you how I was at a party
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It was a it was a
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Conference where they have a lot of different people with different disciplines come together
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:27,200	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know one of those
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,992	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are panelists
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Since we're at one of those functions
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:33,344	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It was a situation where like dinner hadn't yet been served and there was
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:40,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A lot of booze being serious everybody was like drunk on an empty stomach
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So I was standing there with some violin
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What are the fun ones
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The jump Palace
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Night my people fairly and they they start to lose
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Their s***
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like genuinely lose their s***
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	About this thing called
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And like I've never seen signs
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Excited about anything
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What is crispr
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Trying to explain to me what they couldn't slow down enough for me to get it
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I gather that had something to do with genetics and then at one point one of the biologist tournament is like
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'll tell you what it is
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I can use crispr to take a little dog
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And poof make it to a big dog
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Give me a chihuahua
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Turn it into the size of a Great Dane and was like no you
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He's like yes I can I could do it with crispr
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What the hell is this thing
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To sit here is you
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I will get
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So what happened was I came back and I immediately called science writer Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Because I just figured
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For this kind of thing
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The car thing I got tok
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Dr. Carl so I like why all the fuss
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:47,584	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe it was just the alcohol or but maybe there's something really
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Happening Here
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Oh there's something totally happening there I mean it's
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He started
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So that
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You you can actually find like
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The first reference
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In a 1987 paper
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,176	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And some Japanese scientist
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They basically describe something weird
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	N e coli and they said we don't know what this is
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Coli are bacteria inside humans and like all living things
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Equalize made up of DNA and T's and C's Angie's and what happened was it the scientist
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Reading a chunk of that genetic code
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They found this really strange
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:25,727	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Stretch of DNA
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Stretch out well so basically what it was
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	5 identical sequences
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In a row
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then they were separated by very short
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sequences in between them that were
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	All different from each other
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The little blurb
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To be like
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And they look at that sound like what
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But this is nothing like we've seen before repeated sequences in bacterial genomes are kind of unusual
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Seems very strange some biologists felt that there must be a purpose
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Among those purple sneakers Jennifer doudna University of California Berkeley cell biology
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If I used to be called the dude
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sometimes it's cool in the movie she will be played by Jeff
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right meow
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Xango's on scientist are single repeat Loop repeats
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Everywhere
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,703	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah release in bacteria lots and lots of lots species of bacteria
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They say okay wait a minute it's kind of cool your findings it's so often
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is this where the name Christopher comes from
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The full official name is
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Clustered

EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sound like an app
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But now
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Scientist had the puzzle
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If nature at this level preserve something
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Intact

EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Hundreds of millions of years
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You figure out
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Whatever this is
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Doing something
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But what
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It doesn't take very long
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Before the first big clue comes up
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Fast forward
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	2005 now scientists have these big

EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The little you know these little to the bacteria had virus inside of them
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is that what that mean that that a virus brought it
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Into this
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The first recognition was
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is virus DNA
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Somehow all these bacteria
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,831	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A little snippet the virus DNA
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	West Indies
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Particular places
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Energy now
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Which is a little weird if you think about that means are totally different creatures
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It would be like inside a human finding a little bit of mosquito.
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How do we interpret this well
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Actually there was one scientist named Eugene koonin
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To look at these results and just had
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay I guess
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's a defense
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Why would you think that cuz he's a brilliant man if I went to a large
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,015	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sanitation dump
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I found a teeny bit of human hair why would I think
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I wouldn't know it just like a bit human
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Well you see
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,023	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That metaphor might
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,071	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sort of betray your lack
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:09,471	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Skill in microbiology like this is not a dump alright this is
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Bacteria are not going to just
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let virus DNA
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Get into their jeans willy-nilly
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay remember
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Viruses are the big anime
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If your bacteria
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Viruses make your life a nightmare
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Think about in the ocean okay the
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The ocean is
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Full of viruses and
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Viruses kill up to 40%
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Of all of those bacteria
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Everyday
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:35,839	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Everyday
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We know that they have defenses
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When Eugene koonin said was
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm going to bet that
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	These bacteria
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are somehow
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,639	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Grabbing pieces of DNA
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	From viruses
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then they're storing it
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And now they have a way of recognize
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Does viruses have
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They come in later
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Take little Polaroid shots of the enemy
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Write know thy enemy

EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What do you called the mugshot
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,119	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is Eugene koonin
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Evolutionary genomics group at the national Center for biotechnology information
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:20,383	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He's the guy that called reference to stunk up the whole idea that maybe these bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,175	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is the bacteria trying to defend itself
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:24,479	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Both but really if I if I
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If I if I could eat myself

EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,343	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It was not so much kissing
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Because you know
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let's get freaky
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	18
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,511	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Figuring
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ouch
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How the mechanism of likely to be
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So can you
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Walk us through
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How the mechanism is likely to work
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	All right
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,775	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What happens if
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know when the fires comes in
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	2
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Excel
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I just kind of
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Explodes in Skyrim Lisa's naked jeans basically
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you're this bacteria these things might take over your cell so you've got to respond
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,463	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	UShip multiple
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Weapons of Defense
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you've never seen this virus
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Before using the first thing you do says Eugene is you send out these enzymes
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pack the viruses they're sort of like the ground troops
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Any fights really hard
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But much of the time
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Vape fail and then nobody else you are here about
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You're not terribly stupid
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,575	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's good fighter so very often
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Virus takes over
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Bacteria.
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But but there is some
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Nonzero probability
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Did you actually survive at
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,447	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you do
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Then with the bacterial do with sending some new enzymes to basically cleanup
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Go out find any stray viruses.
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,919	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The enemy DNA into
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Beautiful smokey
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And here he says it's where you get to
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To the storage
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Does enzymes woman take those little bits of virus and shove them into the bacteria's
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Own DNA right in those little spaces
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Between the repeat
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right there
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So I use those
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Spaces in my own
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	DNA as a storage facility
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yes if you'll be able to exist
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,287	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You use a different memory device
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cuz here's what happened
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Next time that virus shows up
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Express jeans everywhere now
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You are
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pair
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is where the Christmas tree really gets going
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cuz instead of sending out the ground troops were probably going to get their asses
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Now you can actually send out the
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Guns
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What the cell does it will manufacture these special
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Molecular assassin
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And we'll give those assassin a copy
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Of that little bit of virus DNA it hasn't storage spaces thing here take this mugshot if you see anything that matches this
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pattern killer
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And these attackers do we know what they look but one of them looks like
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yep so we know what the protein looks like it it it actually looks I would describe it a little bit like a clam
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sort of Imagine Pac-Man become misshapen dandruff
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Which one of these guys
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What it has is
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A copy of that virus DNA
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's got the mugshot that is kind of waving around
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What then happens is that whenever the Pac-Man bumps into some virus DNA
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It pulls apart
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The DNA
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is Ipsy
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Read it
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's not the right one goes on
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And if that RNA has the same sequence
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Then click it just locks in
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And molecular blades
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Come out and shop
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So this is smart scissors to it's like
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You're like the thing I got
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	All right now we're going to kill
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Stack match
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,815	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When scientist first discovered this whole system
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They're fascinated
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They were like
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Still working it out
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They're like
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How can this happen
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cool
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But then
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In walks the dude

EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is a tool right this is a tool that we can use to cut DNA
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Where we want to cut DNA
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Her basic thought was when we turn this defense
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Into office
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	These things they seem to be really good at cutting
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I need the only thing to cut the things that are on their mug
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pazzo
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe I could just replace what's on their mugshots instead of them going after viruses
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe they could go after a gene that causes
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Huntington's disease are haemophilia
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For example
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you got a mouse with something like
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Haemophilia
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is a diseases caused by one bad G
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:28,095	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So what you do is you take diesel surgeon to give them the mugshot for the bad Gene then you stick the surgeon with the new mugshot in a mouse
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Can you set it loose
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And just like this program to
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,495	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It will find that Gene and
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Shop
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The scissors will end up
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cutting exactly
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,687	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Virginia wanted
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The badge is gone
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Now the question is how do you put in the good G
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Nitrite turns out actually going to jennifer doudna
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Actually not as hard as you would think
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,487	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Really yeah apparently what you do is
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's just that
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Throw this new good Jean
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kind of in the neighborhood where the girl genius
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just in the general vicinity
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,983	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You don't have to get super-precise and it turns out that
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know there are repair enzymes that are probably continually
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Surveying and checking
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For brakes
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is what happens inside the cell
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is repair Crews
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Come along the sea the break
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:21,087	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The CD good Jean just sitting there next to the break to be like all right
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:29,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'll just take it in with the pretty guy in this space he said we take advantage of a natural repair
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are pathway that cells have
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They trick both the Cutters and the fish
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah now we're not assassinating anymore
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:37,727	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Now we're actually
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Engineering
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Agon from killing to refashioning
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Designing jeans doing genetic
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,927	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Form of genetic engineer
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	30 years yes but
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Not like
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:11,519	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Genome editing technology they've been around for a long time but none of them have been as powerful as
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Best Bets
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz she was actually one of the biologists
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Should I drunkenly talk to at that thing Modern Art Museum I can't even really remember
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Evening setting be so vague
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Back in the day
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is just like two years ago
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You have these Gina De things you would take one put in a cell and what happened before was
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You would give it some instructions about where to go
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And it might go there but it might go somewhere that's a kind of related to where that was
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Staten Island
EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Not only would it take left Staten Island did not find there but it would cost you a fortune and taking up 6 months of your time to get
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know it's really easy
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You just give it that mugshot
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And it goes I'm going to find that guy
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Exactly so it seems to be pretty precise
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And it's
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:09,375	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cheap like the old tools would set you back about five grand to use them once crispr
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The 75 bucks
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And here's the kicker says Carl it seems
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	At the moment that you can take these things out of bacteria
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,591	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Stickman to almost any other creature
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It still works
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You can use this
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,175	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Same crispr system
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,991	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Can you like do it
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Hornets
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Vulnerable
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You can do in corn corn do it in anything
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I have not I'm waiting for someone to say
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr doesn't work in
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Species X
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I have not heard of that
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So basically what you have for the first time in science
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is Gene editing technology that is
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is cheap
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:41,887	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Precise
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,167	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Possible universe
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And Jennifer doudna says the moment the
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The full impact of
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Landed on Earth
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I really I literally had you know the hairs on the back of my neck rest
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just processing the fact that this thing exists
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know that you could actually
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Program it
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To cut DNA and
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:06,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just like this
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Molecular scissors and I can just
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Program and it cuts DNA wherever I want
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It is amazing
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Unless
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Think about it
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Further
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Which we will do engine
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I feel a cloud
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Coming over there
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:33,087	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Don't you see I see you
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Over there but will be right
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Hi this is Lauren from Atlanta Georgia
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Radiolab

EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I'm here because I need your help
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I request
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:09,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	About what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Brilliance
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,727	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To you
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,871	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you have a story

EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is Radiolab Jad abumrad and Robert krulwich okay so clearly the
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Possibilities are there to use crispr to treat disease
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What if you could
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,143	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Get a little more fanciful
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Write like what if you can actually go back in time and resurrect long-lost
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Mrs. Talk about a lot we Could reconstruct using a computer
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What did genome sequence of the ancestor of all birds was
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And that would have been
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,015	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kind of dinosaur
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,087	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Anime could use crispr to turn the chicken into that thing
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For what if you could take an elephant
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,159	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Snip snip snip
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gradually turning
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Into its long-lost relative
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:49,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The woolly mammoth
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cuz they're related
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But if they're there
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We're right but if you know the woolly mammoth genome which they do cuz
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Play Family Guy.
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crossbones
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Then you could
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Compare the number of differences use crispr to
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr out
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The different parts of the elephant and put in woolly mammoth
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you can infect go backwards in Thai
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Time and make changes in obviously I think you can go the other way to item mean
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,159	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Humans are
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Good at design word designing animals
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So if
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It doesn't seem to me to be
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crazy notion to imagine parents all over the
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Taller children so silencing the short jeans and

EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I don't want it on and
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I don't know where the designing stop
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We sorta got into all of this with
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,832	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you can
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Be very very Gene specific
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And you learn more and more about jeans over
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Why couldn't you invent
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Why couldn't you make a
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You might one day get supposed to get enough to do that there's no Wing in pig lab
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know is the best you can hope for right now is a woolly mammoth lab and that's down the hall from where the
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Where the
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The real action is is it now there's a hall and at the end of the phone Tuesday wing it has not been built yet
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,576	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It may be 20 years from now but that's what you looking at
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Well yeah I think but the thing is
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Well because you can't make weight
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Winnie the Pooh
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just because it's her evolutionary barrier
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay well just forget stuff like except for the joke
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,336	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay I don't think that we need
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Federal

EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But we do need
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is like
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We do need to like figure out what are we going to do about
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I mean they're going to be using crispr for cancer
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Going to take me to take people's immune cells out of their body

EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:04,448	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To basically allow them to make proteins are going to be able to
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:05,984	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Grab onto
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cancer cells
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And attack their own cancer

EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	As the human beings get more and more
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Create and design and
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Creative

EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:18,432	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That future will include

EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And that will be new in the world
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I don't think it is new because if you go back to the start of the Scientific Revolution some like France

EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Going to be both about learning about how the world works
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Using that knowledge
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know this has been discovered this is been published
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Everybody knows it
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you if you guys had a cocaine that we're going to all we're going to outlaw.

EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Forget to that conversation with Carl was 4 months ago
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,624	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And a lot has happened
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,440	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pikachu the question that you asked
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like where does the sacred
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Christian and will one of the lines that have been drawn
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	By Jennifer down on others was that we should not
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Use the technology
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Humans who haven't been born yet meaning not on sperm cells
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are egg cells because if you crispr say an embryo that is it that is a permanent change
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right that is a change to the DNA that will be passed on to their children
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And their children's children and their children's children's children you can't ask
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Person
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If that's okay because you're doing it
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Before they're born
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Send
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The real issue
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Imagine making these changes
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cascade through generation after generation
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You could affect the evolution of organism
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:15,680	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I want to say trivial but it's you know it's fairly easy to do it
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kind of profound I feel it's really for
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Profound profound but it was just an idea
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:32,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That is until for the first time in history researchers in China have successfully edit the human genome and
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,856	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	An embryo just two months ago
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It was announced that a Chinese team used a technique called crispr
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In human embryos Evolution itself
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The Chinese team they were not viable
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You actually develop into a person so they're they're going to be discarded anyway still they can figure it out with those embryos what's the stop any
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Boston ethical line
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just sort of thing could be serviced slippery slope towards
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Now that the Grinch party
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's Fred and Robert didn't seem like
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,288	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We called up Carl again
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But we have to revisit we have to revisit because in our Armageddon conversation in which I believe I was
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Extremely alarmist and You lyrics
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:36,832	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Extremely down putting I feel that I should do a small little parade

EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:50,400	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And you have to close you should just begin anytime you want like getting on your knees and saying how sorry you are going to start from there
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:58,336	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm sorry so are we actually surrounded by an army of clones with soup
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Super powers
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:04,224	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah but I think the Dyke has been opened I believe I'm going to quote somebody who said
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:09,856	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe a few weeks ago I think you want me because last week you can writing for naturally
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I think it was maybe with somebody
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Girl
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:16,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Who said that the news from China and that news
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Probably
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The beginning of an entire New Era and I think I actually said it was a historical moment
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:25,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I and I still stand by that
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Do you feel differently now than the first time
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I don't feel different
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Actually because
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,456	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Didn't really know
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,224	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Scientific
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Surprise here
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:40,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He says people been doing all these crispr experiments and all these different mammals
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We're mammals this is bounded
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In fact it may be happening more than we think
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	One account in the journal Nature has said that
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For other Chinese labs
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What are doing this kind of work
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:51,584	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Carlyle Soto
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Which she said was unsurprising to buttocks
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Rising
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,984	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The crisper work the Chinese team did
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Didn't work very well
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,288	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It works
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kind of
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I mean in only a few of the cases
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:06,944	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Did they really get
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Exactly what they want
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:14,880	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They tried using crispr in about 86 embryos and they only got to work right and maybe 28
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A lot of them
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,952	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Mistress made the wrong cuts
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Screwed up the cells and that led them to conclude that this is a technology that's not ready
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right now for application in the humans
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,888	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:26,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I agree
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We still are in this kind of fortunate position where we can see it's dangerous
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So we shouldn't
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Use it
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:38,176	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Animal human embryo
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:45,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I just don't think that we're going to be able to certify find Refuge there in like 10 or 20 years and 10 or 20 years
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr will be
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So sophisticated
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The people will be able to say
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I can get you
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The change you want
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I can do it safely
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:58,144	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I can guarantee you that you will have human embryos at
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,912	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Have
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,936	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The alteration in the
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A particular Gene Yuan
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:02,752	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So then what
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:07,872	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is that Jennifer doudna told us that this experiment similar experiments have been repeated in mice
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,152	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	With
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:10,944	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Moore Advanced crispr system
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is it really there
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,040	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There it was done with almost no air
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sometimes I feel like we're certain
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Displacing all are ethical concerns
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Onto
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:22,208	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Something that hasn't happened yet
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We really are concerned about
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,024	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What we're doing
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The human gene pool
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know it's already here
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,120	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Take
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	As an example in vitro fertilization
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:34,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	About 60000 kids are born a year through IVF and
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Probable that
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Some of those
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Parents chose what they wanted a boy or a girl and when people start doing IVF there was a huge controversy
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	See people said this was dangerous
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,504	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Unnatural
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I don't see
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	People
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Who are unable to sleep at night because of the existence of IVF
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know I'm going to sound like I'm on Roberts out of this I mean okay so
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:58,048	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So won't hurt
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:59,328	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It will be alright
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are you okay so
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:07,008	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you guys know about all the stuff going on Iceland where they're looking
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	People's DNA and
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,080	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Another looking for
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:11,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Do these jeans and so on
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,384	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:16,480	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When they're looking at these Icelandic people they found that some people
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,016	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Had
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A gene that
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Protect them
EDL	00:31:21,856	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gets Alzheimer

EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let's imagine your doctor said
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Know if you
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like for an extra $1,000
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,376	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We will take these IVF embryos and we will
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Use crispr
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To give them the Alzheimer
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,216	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Protecting

EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:41,056	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Would you like that
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:43,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You want to add that to your to your procedure
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Or would you like your child to
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Two-Face
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Teacher of of
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Alzheimer's
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Your choice
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Teachers might here's my thing here is anything with this hole
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm a little bit haunted by the thing you said which is
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When it's not dangerous anymore
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What will we
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We do and I'm afraid we've already answered
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It is not it's not a
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Question that's open
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,216	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Because if we're already doing this kind of
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Stuff and who's going to say no to that
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,056	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Who's going to say no to that
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah we've already answered the
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,224	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We may have
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So that's how we ended our peace
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just now two years old
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Broccoli
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Roughly and the drunk biologists at Chad's cocktail party couldn't have been more pressure when you think about it
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:41,984	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is one of those this is one of those strange cases where like you do a story usually like we just going to leave it behind other things but
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In the last
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:44,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Almost 2 years
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,616	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So much has happened
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So we figured we need to update this thing so what we did is we asked our produce return wheeler and our producer Molly Webb
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just go out ask around make some calls and
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ellis
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:32:58,880	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What's been going on
EDL	00:33:00,928	00:33:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	41 Molly do you want to give him the big news
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:09,888	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The Jennifer Lopez is going to do a television show based on crispr
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:16,288	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Give me an active role in the fictional narrative of the show
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:21,408	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	She's like something old something and crispr is involved
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:26,016	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Really yeah where you at headlines
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:31,136	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Wow it's crossover to that extent that's the thing is that gets the sum
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:37,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And I like that I was like Jennifer Lopez knows about crispr and she was like this is such a hot-button issue Where do I
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:39,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's amazing
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Okay so so
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:47,520	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Moving putting JLo aside science development have been quite a few
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	House right now what are those
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:54,432	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I mean I guess I would just say that it's being used everywhere now so it's being used in crops
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's being used in medicine it's being used in basic research
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:34:03,392	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's being used hermansau and humans being used in eyeballs
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:09,792	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Clinical trial with actually injecting a syringe full of crispr carrying viruses into your eye
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:12,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Eyeball to overcome a genetic condition
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What leads to blindness to this would be like with the viruses injecting the crisper the thing goes and cuts out the bad genes
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,032	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Exactly just take
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know a big syringe full of viruses and just stick it in people's eyes
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:26,944	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yes so course when we did the update
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:30,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Soren and I called Carl Zimmer
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:32,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Things are moving very fast
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:33,344	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And what kind
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,624	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Thanks so
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They are
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Doing things that look like
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:40,256	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Curing diseases so Carl told us about one study
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,536	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Where
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It seems like they cured a certain type of muscular dystrophy in mice
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Cured must be cured muscular dystrophy in mice
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Wow well then might not become normal nice but they get much much stronger
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Then they would have been yeah so in your body you have a gene
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That makes a protein that gives your muscle
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:02,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Full strength but with muscular dystrophy
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There's like
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:09,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Typos in that Gene a mutation into that proteins not made and the result is that
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,744	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Your muscles start to turn into sort of a
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Fat-like substance
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:15,584	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Has been described no power
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah okay so your diaphragm gets weaker and weaker your heart gets weaker so in this case they use crispr
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To fix that Jean
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you get
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Protein in these mice
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I actually saw
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:31,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	At the heart get stronger or the mouse
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Was able to push with more Force
EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:38,368	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm button until they said over weeks they just saw like strength-building up
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:41,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Are they going to do that humans pretty first
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pretty First Step be at this point but yeah this is one of the first experiments to show that this approach could work
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Muscular dystrophy vitamin that's not a disease
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:53,216	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	With a cure is it not until
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,520	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Potentially in mice now yeah
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:36:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And there are some human trials that it be there
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,408	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Started or
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I probably going to start soon treating cancer example people are talking about one and lung cancer
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:12,160	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sure lung cancer or no
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What they want to do though is they want to
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Use crispr to go into immune cells where would cut out the part of the DNA that
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:22,144	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How to put the brake on the immune cell
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:22,912	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you're you're taking your immune cell off the leash
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,544	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I can attack
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Tumors
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Marc Gasol
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:37,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So the folks who invented this then must stand to earn a fortune
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:40,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There's actually a big patent
EDL	00:36:40,064	00:36:40,832	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Dispute
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's happening right now so one of the guys know this is the one thing that I have heard
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	About a lot of you had been checking your crispr inbox you might have seen last week
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There were two teams
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Jennifer doudna steam out at UC Berkeley from the West Coast team and then on the other side
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is this group of researchers at the broad Institute
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,384	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Witches on East Coast
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:10,784	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And so basically they both filed for a crispr patent so there was sort of this like
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	East Coast West Coast
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,088	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	For the last
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Year
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Showdown and just last week
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The US patent office decided
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:24,096	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That it would indeed go to produce is the not doubting
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:27,936	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The not doubt the team but there are more patent super awarded
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And there will probably be a peel so I don't think anyone thinks it's settled yet
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:34,848	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So in the Civil War of
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:37,152	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Over over crispr patents
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There has been a Gettysburg
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	There are many more battles
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What happened
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,552	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gacha
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:48,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is there is there anything else on the on the list of like What's Happening Now exciting stuff happening now
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:55,072	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Can we do favorite strike and I do kind you're my favorite and then you can do your favorite
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	My my favorite came from Carl
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,960	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah yeah they're actually trying to use it
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	As an alternative to antibiotics
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:08,128	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We're headed to know what I'm saying that means
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What do you say eyes like an antibiotic to me is a pill that I tell you
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So what would crispr Howard crispr replace that
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Well you
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,600	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Your pill would have crispr in it
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How how would it work you know in the same way you would take your amoxicillin or your antibiotic pill
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:25,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You would actually take a pill that was filled with crispr
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:29,376	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then it would go out and it was fight bacteria
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:30,912	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That is attacking your body
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:35,264	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you could pick out you know some super essential Gene that it has
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And chop it
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And that will kill the bacteria
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Oh you would turn the Assassins on the bacteria exactly
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:43,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So there you go
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah the antibiotics thing seems huge right cuz everyone's at this moment where they're like what happens with the Neck Road for bug
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	If you could actually just go in there and Kamikaze the DNA of like
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:57,792	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Staff or whatever he'd be solving a lot of illness
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:04,960	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah but what's what what's your fave
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:11,360	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe the scariest to hi Kevin how are you I'm doing great how are you
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kevin esvelt
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm at the MIT media lab
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He was sort of on the early edge of thinking about crispr I meant I think of myself as an evolutionary engineer before anything
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:24,928	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Got into biology because when he was a kid he went to the Galapagos
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:25,952	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	My parents took me there when I was
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	10 or so and I was just captivated
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:32,352	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just looking all the creatures and I thought I want to make organisms that are as beautiful as that
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You actually thought I want to make organisms as beautiful as that
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	1
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's like the childhood vision and then it's so hard right
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,848	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Forget it
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:45,408	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And but now with crispr like
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Almost like All Things become possible
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So anyway to get to the crazy part Kevin couple years back he's working at the Harvard Medical School and one day
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	He's walking to work through this some the spark this
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,720	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Park called the emerald necklace
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In Boston
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's beautiful and there's a small river flowing through it and you have these
EDL	00:40:03,840	00:40:08,448	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ponds with turtles in whatever giesen and you know he's thinking about
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:10,240	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr and what he can do and all these
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:11,776	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Animals that are around him
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,568	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And he has this
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:14,592	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This thought
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What if
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:16,896	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We could
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,688	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Encode crispr
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	In the genome
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:21,760	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What if we
EDL	00:40:21,760	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Program The genome to genome editing on it
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Own
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Wait what what I'm I'm I'm not sure if all that what is it what is he saying well
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,744	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The first
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gene drives
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Maybe this is the way to think about it
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let's say that you want to tweak a mosquito
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,168	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And make it so that the
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Little parasite that carries malaria terrible awful malaria
EDL	00:40:42,496	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Either can't get into the mosquito or can't live in it until that mosquito will no longer carry malaria that would be great that would be a great day
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,968	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Think is malaria is a bad thing so you could now take crispr
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:57,344	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I send it into the mosquito and change the gene inside the mosquito so now that mosquito either
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:03,744	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Doesn't let malaria parasite in or kills it or whatever but basically doesn't carry it and that's great
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,792	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Right but then I put it on to the wildness got us
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And for itself amongst all the other mosquitoes so my mosquito has a special Gene but it's going to mate with some mom
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Mosquito
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And that Mom is he doesn't have the normal old Jean
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And the baby's going to get my specialty but it's also going to get the normal
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gene and that means that your baby has like a 50% chance
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Having your
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:26,272	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Special training of because
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:27,808	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Only one of those two genes gets
EDL	00:41:27,808	00:41:34,208	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Sprite in the baby and then in the Next Generation the grandbaby there's only a 25% chance and you know on and
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,976	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	On and on
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,280	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you're exponentially losing Chris
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Superpowers your chances just each generation get less and less of this Gene is going to stick around that's right because
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:46,240	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Regardless of what we do natural selection wins in the end
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Until Kevin is walking to work through the park and has his idea which is to use
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,919	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr to create something called
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Gene Drive
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I came to drop yeah
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Instead of just skip the DNA and insert a gene that we want
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Also insert the genes that encode the crispr system
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,487	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And tell it to make that particular change
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Here's how it works
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:14,399	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You go into the mosquito and give it the new Gene that makes it resistant to malaria
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then right next to that
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:18,495	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You put the jeans for the
EDL	00:42:18,495	00:42:23,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr system you just used to make that change a spare scissors or something
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:28,223	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	An insurance how that plays out your first mosquito has this Gene with the new change
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And it also has the scissors yeah I'm going to meet some normal mosquito which has the normal
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The two end up
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Side by side in the baby
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Now the new mosquito Gene makes the Little Caesars which go over to the normal Gene
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:40,767	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Snip it
EDL	00:42:41,279	00:42:42,815	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And turn it into itself
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So now there's two copies
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Of the new Gene in The Offspring without
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Any human assistance
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Crispr will cut
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Original version
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And copy over the change
EDL	00:42:53,311	00:42:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That Jean does the work that I used to do in the lab
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	On its own inside the baby
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So interesting to okay so like I set it on autopilot
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you're basically allowing the mosquito
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Parent
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pass the scissors to the baby don't we send snip snip snip
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:17,375	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then that baby passes the scissors to the next baby up nip snap it is literally like a chain reaction yeah
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So you know
EDL	00:43:18,399	00:43:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	From 82 grandbaby to Great grandbaby now instead of letting that Gene disappear
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You're driving it into the Next Generation
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That just keeps going down the line down the line down the line
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:33,247	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This is something that spreads
EDL	00:43:33,759	00:43:34,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Indefinitely
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This Gene is going to spread like wildfire through the entire wild populations you don't change
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just one mosquito
EDL	00:43:43,743	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	All of those insects probably everywhere in the world
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	According to Kevin this is the kind of change that could given enough time
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Spread across the entire
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:54,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Species
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So this
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,151	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	This idea of mosquitoes and
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Watching Rampage true population of the dumbness
EDL	00:44:03,967	00:44:05,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	After we had four
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:06,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Publish the idea
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We tried it in East
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,855	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Work on the first try
EDL	00:44:09,855	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	They just popped a little yeast loaded with the gene drive into a population to see if it would take over and
EDL	00:44:16,511	00:44:17,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	One week later
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yep
EDL	00:44:18,047	00:44:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Kevin told us they're probably now I think it's
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:24,703	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	10 different groups who are working on Gene Drive systems yes they are doing it
EDL	00:44:24,703	00:44:29,311	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And mosquitoes and in parasitic worms and in rodents
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	It's all happening in the lab is still they are
EDL	00:44:33,151	00:44:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Trying out
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know
EDL	00:44:35,199	00:44:38,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Dismiss method for spreading genes through a population
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:40,319	00:44:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I just think that sounds terrifying
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like honestly I just keep thinking of it's like oh we've we've just
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Hit over a domino and then walked away and aren't watching where the rest of them are falling
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm very glad you think that was me one full day
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:54,399	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	The reach that point
EDL	00:44:55,167	00:44:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Initially I was slated
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:45:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Let me tell you there is nothing like the she relation of Discovery I think you know this is the end of malaria this is the end of every
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,383	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Hangouts mosquitoes spread
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:08,223	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Wait a minute no ticks spread Lyme disease we can probably get rid of that too
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I thought in the morning you're like you're singing to the turtles in the in the parking
EDL	00:45:14,111	00:45:17,439	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pretty much a full day of being
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:18,207	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Who
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,511	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And then I started thinking but but
EDL	00:45:20,511	00:45:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But
EDL	00:45:21,279	00:45:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:24,607	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What if something goes wrong
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And supposed
EDL	00:45:26,911	00:45:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Go back to your malaria case
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Make mosquitoes malaria resistant well that seems
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:34,079	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pretty safe I mean malaria is a human
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pathogen
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Doesn't really affect
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:38,687	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Other animals
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:39,967	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But what if
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:42,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Say the change you make to the mosquito
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:44,831	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Makes it slightly more toxic something to eat so
EDL	00:45:45,855	00:45:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	When you have to contend with those mosquitoes in
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Boasting
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know it could be that all the frogs are the Fisher whatever start to die off and then that make something else die off and something else
EDL	00:45:56,351	00:45:57,631	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'll stay off
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Credibly complex system and you just you just don't know or if you could be that making a mosquito malaria
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Deer resistant also somehow
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:12,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Makes it do better in some environment than the mosquito population blows up and then it turns out that it somehow makes it
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,015	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Easier to carry some
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,039	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Other disease
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:18,623	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And yours are more likely to go wrong
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:19,903	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	How do you know we should say at this point that Kevin is
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:29,887	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Really thinking about all the stuff he brought together a group of scientists to come up with some safeguards for this type of Reese
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Research so doesn't
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Escape out of the lab and and his team is only working with this version of Gene Drive the day
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:38,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Pacer rigged it
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:43,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	So that it only lasts for certain number generations and it's her runs out of steam but
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,223	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Scientist
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,783	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Can perfectly well
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:48,831	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Start playing around with something in the lab
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That could affect a whole lot of other people
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,927	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	What happened to ask
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:54,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I think what this
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,791	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Technology forces us to reckon with
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:46:59,327	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Is that now it's
EDL	00:46:59,839	00:47:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ffbe Reddit
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:02,143	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	We don't know for sure but
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Theoretically possible for one person
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,239	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Decide
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:09,311	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	To change the local
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Possibly the global environment
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:13,663	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And that
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Ethically problematic race
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I mean if if and when somebody uses crispr
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:26,975	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	An embryo and that embryo grows up into a person
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:33,119	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That will be a momentous thing but if you were to Gene Drive somebody
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:34,655	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Think about that
EDL	00:47:34,655	00:47:38,751	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Can a gene Drive likes a few people in and. Tell them in
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:40,799	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You don't have kids and someone like
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,335	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	And you'd be driving
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:46,431	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Whatever Gene it is that you were engineering midterm or more people
EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:47,711	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	I'm and
EDL	00:47:48,223	00:47:48,735	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:50,015	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	That's different
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:52,063	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	God you know what I'm thinking about
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:56,927	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Thing that Jennifer doudna said I think it was her in our first piece of
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:48:01,023	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like if you make a change and say an embryo like you looking to give this to me snip snip snip give this
EDL	00:48:01,791	00:48:02,559	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Future child
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Make it all alright
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,119	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Whatever
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:07,935	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Like you're doing that without the consent of that Unborn
EDL	00:48:08,959	00:48:12,543	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Yes but if you if you know do what you guys are talking about using this Gene Drive thing
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,079	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Well now your
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:20,479	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Doing it without the consent of that unborn thing and all future generations of that unborn thing and to the consent issues
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:21,247	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Just become like
EDL	00:48:21,247	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Unfathomable
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,807	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Exactly
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	You know I guess we're all for taller
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	But
EDL	00:48:26,367	00:48:28,415	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	All for taller
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:34,559	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Show me and it has something to do with democracy itself like you sit there with a tool
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	A change in your hand and you choose it but in the act of the with his truck in
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:47,615	| radiolab_podcast17updatecrispr |	Any active choosing it for yourself this way you choose it for an uncountable number of others who do not have the
