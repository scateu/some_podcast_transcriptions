EDL	00:00:19,456	00:00:24,320	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Anjana barad this is Radiolab a couple years ago we did a show
EDL	00:00:24,320	00:00:25,088	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	About 8
EDL	00:00:25,088	00:00:25,856	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Crazy
EDL	00:00:25,856	00:00:27,904	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Cold War CIA operation
EDL	00:00:28,416	00:00:29,696	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And a little
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Trick
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:32,000	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Did the CIA invented
EDL	00:00:32,768	00:00:35,072	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To say something without
EDL	00:00:35,072	00:00:36,096	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Saying anything at all
EDL	00:00:36,096	00:00:37,888	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And it just felt like
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	This one survived with the moment you know with the Mueller report coming out and all the redactions and
EDL	00:00:43,008	00:00:45,056	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Intelligence and counterintelligence
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:45,568	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Russia
EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Another story just going to resonate with us again
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:52,480	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Ulcer feels like a throwback to an earlier simpler time
EDL	00:00:53,760	00:00:55,552	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So we just going to play at this week
EDL	00:00:56,576	00:01:01,440	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Hey I'm Jared I'm running today on the podcast
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:01,952	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Back a little bit
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We have a cloak and dagger Maritime Adventure in secrecy and truth from
EDL	00:01:06,816	00:01:08,096	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Reporter Julia Barton
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,144	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just maybe first you can start off just by introducing yourself
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yes of a story for me begins with this guy
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:18,592	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah my name is Jeff Larson I'm the data editor at propublica
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:20,896	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Outfit and Jeff does a lot of their
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:22,432	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Reporting someone in a case
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,200	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It was
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:29,600	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Summer of 2013 you know that big story about how the NSA monitoring millions of Verizon customers
EDL	00:01:29,600	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That just came out just watching the story like all of us are end
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Then the thought occurred to him
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:37,280	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	She's are monitoring all of these people pay
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:38,304	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Does that include me
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,680	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So he goes over to the nsa's website
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:47,008	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	He was surprised to find it right there on the site
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	File a Privacy Act
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:51,104	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	For your metadata
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:53,152	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They have live online for right there
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:55,200	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Service that they offer to everybody
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Until I went ahead and did that yourself you're requesting you say what do you what do you know about who I called
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,904	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who I heard from yes exact
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What were you expecting
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:10,560	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The best-case scenario would be just a you know a page of
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	All of the communications actually to my wife my wife's a Verizon customer and I'm an AT&T customer so I'll
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	All my phone calls to my wife
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I didn't think that I would ever get
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Any response back
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So he hit submit expecting nothing to happen
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It was actually really really
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,112	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Quick I think it was on the order of
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	10 or 12 days
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,232	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You know we came to my home
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,048	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Address sort of a manila envelope
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,072	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You know my wife
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Call me immediately when she picked up the mail and said hey
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You know you got it you got a letter from the National Security Agency and there was
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Complete panic in Irvine
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,312	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So now she's looking in the cabinet
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,592	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Chris Paul
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:58,432	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Beeping out exactly how many open up the letter could you read it
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah I have actually have it up right now
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The letter said
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We cannot acknowledge
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The existence or non-existence of
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Such metadata or call detail records
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pertaining to the telephone numbers you
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Exactly
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What does one know when one hears that
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I don't know I mean when your Porter and you hear that
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It's sort of that you put you in this weird place so Jeff takes the letter into work
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:30,176	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Next day and he shows it to a colleague been doing a lot of reporting on drone strikes
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Guantanamo and he's like
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What the hell is this
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:36,064	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Does it mean something and she said that was a glomer respond
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	How do you spell how do you say is it's how do you spell globe
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Glomar
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,024	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Glomar is a
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	GL
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	M a r
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Bloom
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What did you think
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just of the word
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,984	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I thought it was I thought it was some lawyer
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And Kumar who had argued successfully argued the case
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Because it sounds like a bit of legalese
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,968	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I didn't know the fascinating story behind it
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So why start looking into it
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:10,112	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And right away found this nutty story involving a nuke
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,672	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	A claw billionaire some manganese
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And this classic tension between Secrets being really
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,280	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Necessary
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And really harmful
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Sneaking
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But to get there you have to
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Start with this guy
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Okay start out by
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Getting your name and how we should identify you know my name is David Sharpe
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,335	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That's my real name
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	During the mission my name was David Schultz
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So in late 60s David was working at the CIA he's been there for a while and he got called on to
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	This new thing
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:52,351	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Called project azorian I started the program in 1969
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Here's what you need to know
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In the late 60s the US and the USSR were playing this high-stakes
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Chess game with their nuclear submarine
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:08,479	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Cruising around international waters and there was a lot of harassment than went on getting on each other's territory
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In fact in January 9th
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Create a US naval ship
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Captured after leaving
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,159	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pan and everyone was worried that the Soviets had her code book
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And there was an interest in getting even
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,255	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Well 2 months later
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In March of 1968
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	A Soviet sub called the k-129
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,143	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Vonage
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We don't know exactly why it sunk
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There's all kinds of
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Conspiracy theories about what might have happened it just sank to the bottom of the ocean
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,919	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And once the Soviets
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Sentara search Cruise out
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Trying to locate it
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And failed
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We came in and
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Somehow through our sensor technology or
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Whatever reason your conspiracy theory of Choice by tell you
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We found the boat
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So then the thought was
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,351	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	If we could get inside that thing
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,911	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Such a bonanza
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There was a lot to be learned
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Whether it would be the code books the cryptographic equipment for and it's the big one
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Missiles it had it had nuclear missiles on the chief of
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:17,343	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Naval operations it really wanted to see if we couldn't recover that submarine the whole thing
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Problem was at the subway three miles below the surface of the ocean and the pressures at that depth according to David
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	A roughly 7500 pounds per square inch
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,703	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	14 million pounds
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	No big one so their solution is to get
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	A room full of top-secret Engineers together and just start spitballing ideas
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Like what if we just went down there to attach Rockets to it blast the target up to the surface
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	How do we catch it when it comes out what if we okay we could we can
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:07:00,351	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You put these pontoon or gas filled bags and Float the target up except that we can't get the gas
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In there because of the pressure must have been amazing meeting or you could say anything
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You could say that
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So in the end they settled on
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Claw
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Idea was to build this
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Gargantuan eight fingers
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Claw and
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And a boat
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And then you would
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,343	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Put the claw in the boat
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Wring it out
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	On the high seas
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,671	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And then you would lower the claw
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	3 Mile Long piece of
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,023	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pipe string
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,815	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And then like one of those
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:36,959	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Carnival games you know where you you have to grab the toy by remote control you would position the cloth over the sub
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,263	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And exactly so
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And then you would
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,567	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yankees
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Off the bottom of the ocean
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pull it back into the boat
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Gatewood open on the bottom of the boat
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In the claw and the submarine would come into a chamber
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And you would have it
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I'm totally not making it up
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The CIA made it up
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:02,303	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Is it just sounds weird but they did it they got the money they got the approval from the president but they still needed to cover story
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So they called up
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Billionaire
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:11,263	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And they asked him or probably is people do you guys think you could just
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pretend to have a sudden interest in manganese mining from the bottom of the ocean
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Because Howard Hughes was a known inventor it wasn't Howard Hughes
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:29,439	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Living in isolation in Las Vegas is fingernails growing inches long and being pretty bizarre
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You know I don't know if he was living in Las Vegas but the rest of that I think is probably pretty accurate
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:40,959	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Anyway so the end up building this massive ship glomar Explorer the ship was called glomar
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,727	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That's where the word comes from
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah it was built by this company called Global Marine
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:51,967	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Global Marine glomar and
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	74
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They get the boat out there
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,831	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They lower the claw
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Clawson MI
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Bottom of the ocean where the sub is
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Anco headlights and cameras on it
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So they could see what was happening
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Do you remember when you first
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,375	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Saw it
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It was a very badly mangled hole
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And we could see it very well
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Big actually could watch as the
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Claw wrap its massive claw hand around the sub and begin to pull it back up
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	14000 ft
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	12000 feet above 9000 feet from the surface
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We were beginning to feel some cautious optimism that we might just pull this thing off after all
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,255	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Then
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I felt so just a little a little bump in the ship
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And we went to the control center
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And everything look normal
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	On the television screens
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But then it suddenly occurred to the
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Operators
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That these television images had not been refreshed in other words they were television images taken
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Maybe 15 minutes ago
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:03,903	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And when they refresh those images and got the real time
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Picture of what was going on
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It showed that we lost
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We lost most of the submarine
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Basically
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The part of the sub with nukes
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	With the missiles
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Maybe with the code books
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,263	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And all the stuff they wanted
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That part broke off
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,567	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Years of work
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Millions of dollars
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just slowly sank to the bottom of the ocean did your heart go
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah yeah it did it did it was it was
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Tinsley
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,255	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Emotional
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,095	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And yet they find anything we still don't really know
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They've never actually disclosed what they found in that piece from David's description it sounds like they didn't
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Get a lot but
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There's a whole reason I'm telling you this
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It's because
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Not long after that
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Bike intense
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Moment
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Disappointment
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The story starts
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The break-in the Press
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Turtles are starting to
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:07,391	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Call up the CIA they're asking all these intense questions they're onto it
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And the CIA
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Figure out what to say
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And what not to say
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Jets it's a dilemma
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There's no question about that
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,375	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Which brings us to Walt
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Walt Logan
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,423	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Which is
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,727	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just to be clear not your actual name
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What's a pseudonym
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So in 1975 Walt was a lawyer at the
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:29,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	CIA that time I was leaving associate general counsel
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And as a story with breaking and all these journalists were asking questions
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It became his job
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,295	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To develop
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The response
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Simple
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Except not so simple
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yes there's a diplomatic element of what's going on in here that isn't swab
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And that is that you have the Soviet Union and the United States
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	At odds
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And the problem was
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,751	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We didn't want the Soviets
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To know either what we had found out
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Or what we hadn't found out
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Either way would have been bad
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	If we said that we didn't recover any information on Soviet missile
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Which was the truth then that would tell the Soviets that they don't have to worry about the security
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Regarding their Warriors
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,975	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	David says we wanted them to worry
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	This is a cold war we might as well make them think we found something
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	On the other hand if we said
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,143	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That we did
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,703	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Recover information on the missiles
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But we're not going to tell you that would be lying
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And they couldn't do that
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We don't governments lie all the time why can they lie because this is 1974
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	This is the year of Watergate this is the year that
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Congress breaks the entire Federal Security apparatus over the coals
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	This is also the year they revisit something called the Freedom of Information Act
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:54,911	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Boya
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Actually Floyd been around for a while but that's when for you finally got some teeth
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Place has anybody any American should be able to ask the government for documents and the government has to respond
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It has to
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	For cover that information
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Help
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Are you put it this way
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Well it's not a huge fan of this Loft investment
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Time
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Resources
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:25,375	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And to willy-nilly give it over to somebody who writes a letter to the agency is is
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:30,239	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The wall season the cia's job is to keep secrets
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,775	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In keeping secrets
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Keeps America
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In fact every CIA employee is legally bound to protect something called intelligence sources and methods
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,247	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It's not an option it's a law
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Hence his
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,647	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So very well
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Under the foil all the public has a right to know on the other hand
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	He has a legal obligation
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To not tell the classic tension of our times exactly
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What have to say something
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	He has to be truthful when he says it
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But he also
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Cannot reveal anything
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,687	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And people's agency have been trying to figure this out for months
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Is why they brought in
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And how long did it
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	KQ2
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Come up with this kind of response
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I would say probably a half an hour
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Well
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That half an hour of work
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Tortured journalist
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:27,583	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And lawyers for almost four decades
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Is we came up with
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The glomar response was basically the following
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,239	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We can neither confirm
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Nor deny
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The existence of the information request
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Hypothetically

EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Very straightforward
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:56,511	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I think about that that's that addresses what we were you were just trying to
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,279	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Put your finger on
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You can't
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Confirm it
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,887	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Which would be giving up Secrets nor deny it
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:05,471	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Which would be a lie if it was classified you couldn't be revealed anyway
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,799	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Suckers as you can imagine
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	People who file these foia requests when they got a response like that
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They were like that's not going to stand
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You are the sucker
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,039	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They fought it in court and the fight went on
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,599	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	4 years knock-down-drag-out but eventually
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:22,879	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The government wins
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Judge rules in their favor well the judge agreed to their logic that sometimes

EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Kind of response
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Bloated to the point where now you here actors like Will Smith using it confirm

EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But on a more serious note
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Since that initial glomar response in 1975
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:27,903	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	More more government agencies have begun to use it surprisingly and not the obvious ones
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,183	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We found some from the
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Department Commerce
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Department of the Treasury Department of energy before then
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Centers for Disease Control that this thing has legs
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And it makes you wonder
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Why does this thing have legs
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Why now
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,311	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It is weird like this
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That guy that Republican guy
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You started with
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Jeff Larson
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It's all he's asking is what do you know about who I
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,783	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Call Andy on the answer is expecting to get it's like
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You know you call your wife
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Why would they glow Mart that well they told him in that letter that if they
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Confirm or deny the existence or non-existence
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Of those records
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It would help
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Are at the average
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Stories of United
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I just I just so that I can sympathize with the United States of America for a moment
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Why would that be right
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:22,943	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I gave they said you called your wife on Monday at 3 Thursday at 4:30 she called you back at 6
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	6/15 what would an enemy than learn
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I guess that they they would learn
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They have records of me calling my wife
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Sodium statutory reason why I've read
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	You're sort of foias are denied with a glow my request
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:43,935	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Is that if you say someone is under surveillance by acknowledging record
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,007	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Or you say they're not under surveillance by
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Acknowledging no records
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:51,103	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Either way it's outlines
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:52,127	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The Contour of the
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The program is a tiny crack
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Through which people can
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Set of puncture the wall and
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:03,391	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Get information about the larger program so you just given us the government's position that makes perfect sense to me
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Let me look at the thief or to come up and say to me I'm a cop
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,279	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Are you investigating me if I say yes but he can
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Can hide if I say no then you go rob another bank or the other robbers will know that I missed a really good bank robber and I'm
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I'm terrible at
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In anyway I seem like
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I feel suddenly dangerously exposed
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:26,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I don't know it's all very very confusing and you could wrap your brain around it and never get to sleep for the rest of your life
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:26,687	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	She thought about it
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And by the way there is a we should say a very good
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Argument against that argument
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,695	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That transparency is a good thing
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:44,095	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	If you have an agency that doesn't have any sort of constraints on it or doesn't have the
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Proper oversight
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	8 / steps
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:51,007	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That argument from NPR special correspondent
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:53,311	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Dina temple-raston when we come back from the break

EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	About the glomar response where government agencies refused to either confirm or deny
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,663	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Something in response to a freedom of information requests
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And ask Julie was supporting this piece
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Robert and I called up NPR special correspondent Dina temple-raston
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Just a sound her out
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Cassia
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Covered counter-terrorism for NPR for years and so she been glomar Don drones she's been blowing hard on
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Harris investigations I've never actually heard it
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	As being glomar
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I have to say that she told us something interesting that this
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Whole non-denial denial state of
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Weirdness
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Has created some very unique situations for her as a reporter
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Seance
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,199	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Flanagan Monday
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	She sits down
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Rights of foia requests about the Drone program which will get
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Glomar
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Then on Tuesday
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The government will turn around
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Organize a meeting for reporters
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	About the Drone program a story about a drone target is out and it seems
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Incorrect
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To the White House
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In in a big enough way that they feel they need
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Correct the record
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So they will often conduct
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,751	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	A conference call
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	On background with a number of reporters from a number of different organizations
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And basically say to those reporters
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,943	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Okay here are the following people who are talking to
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:36,223	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To you but you are not allowed to say
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who they are
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And they're going to put this in context
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And you can quote them as and they usually set the ground rules in a senior Administration official
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Administration officials familiar with
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,535	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It's a program or something like that
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And what then happens is they get to correct the record without
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:54,655	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Officially
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Confirming that something is going on
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There's an interesting thing about the White House in government that
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:03,871	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That they believe that they still have deniability if
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	High-ranking official
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,175	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who is unnamed
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Says something is go
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,271	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And as soon as a name is attached
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Then the information in their view fundamentally change
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	It suddenly becomes
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,416	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Concrete
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And actually that's
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Kind of what happened with the project azorian that
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,304	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Glomar Mission from the 70s
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Even now the only reason that we know half of what we know about this whole thing
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Is because
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Some historians we're really dogged with airfoil requests
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,824	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And they found out about this whole series of
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Internal CIA newsletters and in one of those newsletters
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There was a
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,992	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	An article with the title that
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Clue the man of this
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,296	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Glomar mission
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Before that
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pacific article
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah when they have a name of an article than they can for you that and then it's really hard for them to say
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	No documents exist because they have the actual title of it when it gets specific
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:57,632	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yes
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,936	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So the CIA released this article but
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I mean by now
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,752	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Decades of past
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That's what
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:08,896	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	People now say about the glomar response is that it's just a delaying
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,200	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Because Congress and
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:17,600	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	I talk to this one guy Jamil Jaffer he's Deputy legal director of the ACLU and then get Clomid all the time
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We've come to expect them now unfortunately you know I mean when they get a glomar
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They don't get upset they just think okay
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Well we got another two years in court that's what I means it means it means you have two years of litigation before you even get to the point of
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Arguing over whether the government has a right to withholding
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,544	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	What was what's happening with his two years
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Well
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They're trying to strategize so if they really want to know about a program
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,944	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And I really want to get those document
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They will look for any sort of mention
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Of those documents by public officials in the same agency
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:50,880	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	So
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Say you have a pen
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And you love this
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But you don't want anyone to know about it someone asks you if it exists and you say
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:22:59,840	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Say hell no
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Confirm or deny right and then you had a party
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,216	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And you just mentioned in passing you can't help
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,240	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Lovethispic
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Check out this
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Right well I was nearby
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Now I take it to a judge
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,128	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And if they look
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	He's talking about this pen at a party he's bragging about it
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,736	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	He can't refuse.
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Confirm or deny its existence anymore so they're looking for cracks in the glomar
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Yeah over this two years yeah and it's this
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,976	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Really expensive legal strategy that most people can't even get to
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Only big outfits like the ACLU can even challenge them and their government May ultimately lose it all
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	These cases but it will lose at a time when the public debate will have moved on to something else
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And that's one of the real Danger series
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Next Step
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	By the time the truth finally comes out
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	We don't actually care anymore it's ancient history
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Not for everyone
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Bill the divers
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:58,976	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who are specially trained glomar Mission the original plumber mission
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Second David Sharp says
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,304	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	After they were able to
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pool that last
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Fragment of the sub out of the water
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,936	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They were able ultimately to look at
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Side and where there people in there
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There were
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,056	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There were
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There were three crew members that were
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Basically
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Hole
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,528	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And recognizable
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And there were major parts of another three crewmembers but
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They were
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They were given the full
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Full respect
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That I think the Soviet navy would have
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Conferred upon their own people
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,448	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Under those conditions
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The problem was we were keeping the whole thing Secret
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And that allow the Soviet government
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	To do the same thing
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They probably didn't want the embarrassment of acknowledging that they lost this really important submarine
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	They also didn't want to derail arms talks that we were having with them
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And for a bunch of other reasons they just
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Pretended it never
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Happened
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	But they had to say something to the families of
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	The sailors
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who died on that submarine
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:12,192	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	3 / 3
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	There's a widow of
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,520	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Second in command on the k-129 her name is
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Irina is Ravenna

EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	And then she reads it

EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:55,200	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Who is the author
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:26:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Wanted to know for 30 years who is the author of this horrible inhumane document it would save him

EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Doesn't even make any sense and that that's cruel
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	In this context it's cruelty
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	That's what she say
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,800	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Give me an answer that says nothing
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podcast19glomarredux |	Can be worse than just
