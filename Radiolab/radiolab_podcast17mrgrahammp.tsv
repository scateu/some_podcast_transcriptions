EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:56,224	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So he was pulled over on West Boulevard in Charlotte which is
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Four lane road
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:02:00,576	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Buddy he work for the city of Charlotte in the department of

EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:07,232	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It was Monday afternoon and on that day when adjusting one's friends or co-workers stop by
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:14,144	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	After talking for a bit Mr Graham asked to be taken to a nearby convenience store
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:16,192	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It was only two or three blocks from his house
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:17,472	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He needed some orange juice
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Because he was
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:23,104	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Suffering the onset of a diabetic insulin reaction
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:25,664	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Soda Thorn Hopkins from car
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:29,760	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	They drove over to the convenience store to Thorn got out got a bottle of orange juice
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Got to the checkout counter but
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,088	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	There's a line there
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:37,952	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So I put the bottle down and hurries out get back in Sprint car they take off
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:39,744	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Now
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,536	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This is where the problems
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Started
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:49,472	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	10. At the same time all that's happening there's actually an officer who was African-American
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:55,872	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Sitting in his squad car and what that officer observed was a man hurrying out of the store jumping
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Sing into a waiting car and
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Quickly driving off
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So you started to hail the thorn in his friend but after a couple of blocks
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Pull them over just to determine what was going on there
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:11,232	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So he goes up to the driver side presumably gets to Thorns buddies drivers
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Goes back to his squad car
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Start radioing
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Get ahold of the store to see if anything that happened
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And it's right around that moment.
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The passenger
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,008	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Seed of

EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Circle the car once or twice

EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He started going

EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	At some point around here the details are a little unclear
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Pretty nasty scuffle ensued
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	According to what is known as kasodus of the storm was resisting the officers and apparently officers slam Des Moines head into his friends

EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	One on each arm one on each leg and just

EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Learned that nothing at all had happened at the convenience store there was no crime there was no robbery there was no show
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Shoplifting
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Set a dragon back to his house still in handcuffs
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The car

EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Front yard took the handcuffs off and then just drive away
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Was there an apology
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Oh no
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Now what came out of that day in Charlotte
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Would end up becoming one of the most important
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Supreme Court cases
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	History when it comes to pleasing

EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,655	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Something so seemingly small
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:38,079	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Would eventually become tied to this and all the
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Shootings we've seen in the past years mostly of young black men every time we hear one of these shootings every time there

EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	She wouldn't let him go because of you know doing this are right there that she didn't want him to have to experience
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All that
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All that mess
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:40,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This is a CBS News special report in spillover the kind of day I mean like the Civil Rights
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Movement was a lot of things but there was this big part of it that was about
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Police brutality
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Angeles
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Also known as the long hot summer of 1967
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	50 race riots across the country
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:11,167	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	A lot of which was sparked by accusations of police brutality
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	50 Cent
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I will not
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:17,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Accept charges against policeman I will not
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Except
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Charges against policeman this is a statement
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Might be any difference might not be any different
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You understand that
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If we cannot bring charges against the policeman who have murdered us
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,767	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I just throw it out homes and businesses where will we go
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Where will we go
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	She didn't want him to have to experience
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All that all that mess
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So ended up I think he ended up on the Fayetteville State
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Inspected by college in North Carolina
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And when you graduated actually one of the first jobs that he had he work for an employer called Precision spray
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Spring Steel company that specialize in making Springs but at a certain point you assuming the company
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Discrimination based on how they were treating you
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You know people of color
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So after that day with the officers and Charlotte one thing I do remember
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Dad saying was that it wasn't right
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Difference in a fight
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,959	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Right
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:21,311	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And that is how he ends up walking into Woody's office on crutches in 1985
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He tells what he
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I want to sue the Charlotte Police Department
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So we went ahead and just filed a lawsuit in federal court Woody takes it to trial and basically is arguing
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Squeezed I had used excessive force
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That was totally unnecessary under the circumstances like they roughed up a diabetic who is telling them
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He was a diabetic
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Eventually the judge presiding over the
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Ruled that
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	These officers did not use excessive force and if you were going to
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Claim that they did
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	We had to
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:55,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Show that the police officers had acted
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Maliciously for the purpose
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Causing harm
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Hot today they had to prove that the officers at cement
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To hurt him
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:08,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah that Woody and the thorn had to prove that the officers
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Had it out for the thorn and we simply couldn't do that
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If it seems like a really hard thing to
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Prove it's an almost impossible standard to me
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I think it's important to zoom in on this for a second because it's really kind of like the
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Crux of the story
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If the question is what should the standard be for holding
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cop cannibal
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Portuguese
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The forest ending
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In the mid-eighties
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:34,527	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Malicious intent was sort of the prevailing stand
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If you're going to claim
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That a police officer use excessive force
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's you and the standard was that you had to prove
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That the officer did so
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	With malice in their heart
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Why was that the standard
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:53,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This is kind of hard to explain. I don't have the 14th amendment in front of me but it
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Essentially
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All you really need to know is that it was connected the Fourteenth Amendment to a particular clause
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In the Fourteenth Amendment
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And this is why would he in the thorn lost that
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's okay alright so loses a federal court loses Federal makes its way up to the fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That went nowhere
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The Court of Appeals
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	World against us
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Same thing same thing
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Then nothing after that ruling what are you get the phone call and you hear me from this
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:26,751	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Jerry Beaver unknown civil rights lawyer in the area in Fayetteville North Carolina Gerald was older and wiser
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,799	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So then maybe that's your wording not mine
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Gary had caught wind of the circumcision images Lake
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You should not have to require that
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Police officer had it in for you
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,831	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I just wanted to beat the crap out of you just cuz it made him feel better
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So I called Woody and said are you guys planning on taking this case to the Supreme Court and we was like no
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	McClain can't really afford that I said tell him he doesn't have to worry about that we will be glad to take it on pro bono
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	When see if we can get this ruling overturned
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Make sure that what you said
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Sure
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Let's go
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So Jane we get together and they start looking around like like without their what cases can we draw and argue that there should
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:15,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Be a different standards and there was this well of Glee season 4 cases
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Bubbling up in the court and you had lawyers trying out all these different ideas now most of the courts were using the four
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	14th Amendment malicious intent standard that during would even like then there was also in the number of cases
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What's the eighth unusual punishment
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	From there what is cruel what is unusual
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:47,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Imply that you're trying to hurt somebody right
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The winters are there men in at some of the courts were you seen that
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Woody and Jerry look
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Tuazar sort of like
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Redeemer
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The Fourth Amendment 4th amendment
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The 4th amendment which is
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Swim which is the government cannot subject citizens to unreasonable search and seizure
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I have it on my legal pad
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The fourth amendment is
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The right of the people to be
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Secure in their persons houses papers and effects
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Against unreasonable searches and seizures
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Shall not be
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:17,599	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Violated
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,159	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It is seizure just another word
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Perforce
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,207	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like I have the right not to eat
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Beating your shot by my government yeah it's it's not just that but yes it it also includes that
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And it's like so much about the fourth amendment is that in there
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is this one
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Important
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,983	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Worried
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Unreasonable reasonable reasonable
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Concept of reasonable
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:41,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What is reasonable and what is not raised
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:46,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In law reasonable is it supposed to be object
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You look at the case from the facts of the case
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You look at the who what where when
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Not the correct then you asked was this person's Behavior reasonable
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Or not they have to act with objective reasonableness
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Wait a second reasonableness is a slippery thing
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What you find reasonable would I find reasonable could very well be different be completely different yes or no
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It can feel slippery but legally the whole concept of reasonableness have
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Hundreds of years
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Use of
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Precedent
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I mean I I find this very fascinating and I don't know if you want me to give you like a little bit of
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Backstory
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Do you want
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:29,791	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To give me a little bit of ice. It's interesting how it came to be and how popular it is
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Take me to take me on the ride
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Okay alright so we go back to the 1830s Andrew Jackson

EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So bad
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But Kelly was one of those farmers who knew you could use
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,831	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Asset statistics difficulty
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	How you could
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Take an average of all the different measurements and average of the meteorological data and I can help you pinpoint
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	We're stars were actually going to be in the sky
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:37,887	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Lego that they can make predictions
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's whoever seems like revolutionising
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Astronomy
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Italy became
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Fascinated by this idea of averages and what he did is he
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He kind of took that idea
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I took it down from the heavens from the sky and started applying it to
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cute
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So you can call me through data in medical journals trying to determine the average height of a person the average weight
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,135	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Temperature
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Was he trying to come up with these or proto-man Tennessee
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Totally ever had a huge impact on public health
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:10,399	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Ginza actually going Beyond this and Beyond just like physical traits and starts to like push into
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:13,727	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Man's morality and he's looking at crime rates
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Suicide rates
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Marriage rates
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And in the 1830s he starts
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Laying out this concept what is
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I in French
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Loam when which
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Translates into the average
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Man
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:30,623	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The average man so so this is like big data 1830 Style
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,975	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah and in this idea of the average man
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,743	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And they became
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,279	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	They're useful in law
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	English law
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Really
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	How exactly
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Money
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In Victorian England there was Much Ado About people who wanted to sue for damages or left advantages there were
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Need for Thompson averages
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Way to take measure in stock to see if a person block
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This really seemed like the best way to determine if the accused had to pay that you've wet
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	English judges they decreed here's how we will
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Guilds meaning
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What a man
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Honest and have him raise his right hand let's say he's back some hay in a terribly negligent way much more
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	More like a funeral pyre caught his neighbor's home totally on fire
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,215	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But he says that he did
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Nothing wrong so Jerry I ask of you what is it that we shall do how about think of ordinary Folk
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Avenger
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Take a look
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Attic use that hand
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And ask yourself
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This one question
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Did he behave
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like you're ordinary
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Average
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Reasonable man
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Wow
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I didn't even know you had that in you
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If it's okay
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So you're saying
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Judges and juries begin to use these averages as a way to
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Disorder like
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Figure out like if you're suing somebody else
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If it's somebody else did they act out of the ordinary where they unreasonable
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah it was this.
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You can lay in this whole average man thing that English law
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,039	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Started developing this idea this
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Standard don't initially
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	As the reasonable man
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Standard
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:10,463	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Eventually switches a person to be a little bit more
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Gender inclusive
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This reasonable person
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's one of the longest established
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Fictional characters that exist in what is known as like the legal Village we have these other little characters like it starts with the reasonable person
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And then you start you get like a slew of these other
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	These other characters that come out of that which is I have a little list there's
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The ordinary prudent man of business
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The officious bystander there is De fair-minded and informed
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Observer
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	There's the reason Bulger there's the reasonable parent there's a reasonable landlord there's a reasonable neurosurgeon reasonable civil engineer their cellular
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Hairdresser
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Really sort of like it's like in any sort of
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Trade or craft
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Where there is business being done or you have the ability within your craft
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Harm somebody
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Legally it became very useful to have an
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Average archetypal person
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Doing that crap
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So that the jury or the judge
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,831	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Would have something to use as a measurement when rendering judgment
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:11,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's interesting so like in the hairdresser example
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Whatever it was that led to that phrase
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Probably was a kettle alien survey in an imagine one of hairdresser Behavior
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah like like maybe you went in to get a haircut and you walked out and 1/2 years gone right and you're just like weird half
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:32,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And then it's just you go to Courtney like any reasonable hairdresser would not have made that cut
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Right
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What starts with this astronomer and ends up with this
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Village of reasonableness the funny thing about the village
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Please
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So like in English law
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like Matt said there's like this Village of people but in England at the
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,047	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The time they had this idea that
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It wasn't like
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	A village it was people on a bus
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:21:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Call the man on the Clapham Omnibus which is roughly I looked at the London bus route 88
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	People are they going
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I don't know they just ride the all day those people just waiting for the case to come up and be a hairdresser
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In the next. Concept moved in like Australia was like okay we should do that until one part called that the man in the Bondi
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Another Park called at the man on the Bourke Street tram
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Hong Kong got it
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And they said it's a man on the
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:28,448	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Shank shank E1 tram to the bus is just a convenient vessel to hold all these reasonable people
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:31,776	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	England said all these people are on a bus
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Because
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You didn't want someone who's like
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So slowly
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That they are like they're not riding the bus they like hold up in a cave somewhere or someone that is like
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:48,416	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Play upon their Castle it's like the common man it was described as reasonably educated intelligent button
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:48,928	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Nondescript
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:51,488	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And I think like what what Woody
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And Jerry
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To bring it all the way back we're centrally
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:59,680	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Trying to do is to say we need to use the 4th amendment in this idea of unreasonable search and seizure
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To create a reasonable offer
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So we need to add a reasonable officer to the Village or the bus
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Bradley the cases submitted
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In 1989 almost five years after everything happened to the store in Graham that one day in Charlotte
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It will hear argument next number 87 6571 his case went before The Supreme Court
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Graham vs Connor
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Now it's almost there for the arguments we was there

EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I kid you know did something
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:31,712	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:38,112	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:45,024	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:49,632	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,192	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:30,592	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Me to say a few words for contact police officers have dangerous
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I think we can all agree and on occasion they do have to use Force
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:39,808	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And we should say that the majority of the people who are killed by police every year are white
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:44,672	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But if you look at the number of black people were killed and you balance that against
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Fact that black people only make up about 12
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,024	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	70 overall

EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,328	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What you end up with
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is that an unarmed black man is
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:57,984	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Roughly about seven times more likely
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:36:58,752	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To be
EDL	00:36:58,752	00:37:01,568	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Killed by police in an unarmed white man.

EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Add these numbers
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:06,688	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Are very disputed and argued about but what is clear
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:13,856	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is most police officers who use deadly force or never charged in the even smaller percentage serve jail time
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,392	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So mad
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah actually let me just ask
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All the cases we heard about before the break that Litany of case
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	For the past few years in every single one of those
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:27,936	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The jury was asked did this officer behave like a reasonable officer should
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:31,008	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And every single one the jury said yes
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,032	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Why
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Well that's is because
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:38,688	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The reasonable officer standard like from from the moment that it was created
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I was actually kind of a word constrained
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,808	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In a few very important ways
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I have here the
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:50,464	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The jury instructions from the 9th circuit
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And this is what dreams members are
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:58,656	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I told to think about when they have to assess this kind of use of force
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:00,960	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Geraci told this is your job
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,008	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Go to the bank at 8 Primetime Kelly Prime
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:04,800	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Yeah it says
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:11,200	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Under the Fourth Amendment a police officer may use only such Force as objectively reasonable you must judge the
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The reasonableness of a particular use of force from
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:16,832	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And not with 20/20 vision of hindsight
EDL	00:38:19,392	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Those those are a couple really crucial
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:23,744	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Phrases with
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Perspective
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,560	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Of
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:32,192	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	An officer on the scene so you have to look at it through the eyes of the officer on the scene and then
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:35,776	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You can't look at it through the 20/20 vision of hindsight
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:42,176	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Put yourself in the shoes an officer in the moment and look at the world through their eyes and and that's how you have to understand these things
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Where did that where does where did that idea come from to that
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Comes from Graham the guy comes from the Chief Justice

EDL	00:38:53,952	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The reason why this particular use of force must be judged
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:59,840	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	From the perspective of a reasonable officer
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,144	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	On the scene rather than with the
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The 20/20 vision of hindsight

EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In his little tiny sliver of time where the force
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,616	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Actually occurred
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,432	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In fact that moment legally has come to be known
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	As a superseding event
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:52,832	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Meaning what what does it mean meaning
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Meaning that that that moment
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That superseding event it is essentially it breaks
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,048	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Chain of causation
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:06,144	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So if you think of times just this like Continuous Flow this is like no
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:07,936	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You break that
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:11,520	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You stop that and you take this one little moment you pluck it out
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And you like this moment this is the one moment that you look at
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:16,128	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That's all they can think
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Read it and it turns out if you ask
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	A jury
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:21,504	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The question
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,528	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	About you Sephora
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,064	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That way
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,600	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	About this one little moment
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,648	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The Graham standard many people saw it
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I'm in Hope wood would help victims of police violence
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,256	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Does the exact opposite
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:35,840	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	One person might my colleague who covers cops describes it as like cops
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Kopsia dislike their first amendment they just think of it like as a shield

EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,679	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Red
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,775	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What I would do is show a video and then let's talk about brandriff
EDL	00:44:27,775	00:44:29,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Video so
EDL	00:44:29,823	00:44:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Find a projector
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It is really interesting to see these videos from their perspective
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Video of a
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	September 2015 guy named Freddy centeno
EDL	00:44:43,391	00:44:46,463	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Freddy centeno has gone to a woman's house
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like a woman's front door
EDL	00:44:48,511	00:44:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And threatened her and said he has a gun in the cops pull up the other car there's like 20 feet away from centeno who's walking
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	On the sidewalk
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	10 shots
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	7 mm head
EDL	00:45:06,687	00:45:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I translate the white one
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:12,319	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Jim's claims it happens in 1.5 6 6
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:18,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	2nd Swing
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:22,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Clips that Jim shows the lawyer for Freddy Santana's family
EDL	00:45:22,303	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is BAC just like
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:27,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Atrocity
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like this was an atrocity nothing about this use of force should be considered reasonable
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Because the cops in the situation they rolled right up on Freddy centeno they didn't create any space didn't give Freddy centeno anytime
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Get on the ground
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Do you have a chance to get on the phone
EDL	00:45:40,991	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	One second before the fire
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:48,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And the video shows the officers did not get a chance to respond to their commands
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:50,207	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Search employees all these reactions
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:51,999	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And then
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:55,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Play the original body cam video again
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:59,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	See Freddy centeno they tell him to get on the ground he doesn't
EDL	00:45:59,423	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	An engine slows the video down
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:05,311	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	As you can see Santa's right hand
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Reaches into his pocket
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:10,943	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Composite
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,015	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Things like take a look at this right

EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Frozen moment where you can see that Freddy symptom of hand and started to move
EDL	00:46:20,671	00:46:21,951	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The movie
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:28,863	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Just starting to come up out of his pocket that's moment from the pocket to the out of the pocket this to Jim was the
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Moment
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:37,311	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Seems like this is the only moment that matters like forget what happened before forget that the officers rolled right up on centeno forget that they weren't giving too much time
EDL	00:46:37,311	00:46:37,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Space
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:39,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This moment

EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:47,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Start pulling his hand out of his pocket this is the moment where you ask the question what would a reasonable offer
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,319	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Street view
EDL	00:46:48,319	00:46:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Right now
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:50,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This man appears to be pulling out
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:55,231	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Bach I can't tell what it is you probably can't even without outside in
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:59,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Turns out he had a a nozzle from a garden hose
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:46:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What was the
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:01,119	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Malaga

EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Did the officer feels
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:08,607	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Lake was the fear that that officer had a reasonable fear in that moment

EDL	00:52:13,695	00:52:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like plain and simple if you
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You asked was that reasonable on some basic level
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:19,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	No
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:21,375	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It was not reasonable this man

EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Looks like no 20-20 hindsight look at just a superseding moment
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:34,943	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And then ask the question again
EDL	00:52:35,455	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Was it reasonable for the officer to pull the trigger
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:39,551	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Ie
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:42,623	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Was it reasonable for that officer to be afraid
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And the officer who shot and killed Jonathan Ferrell
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Who's facing charges his name is Randall Kerrick

EDL	00:52:58,751	00:53:01,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The character cast and could you tell the jury about
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What pace he was coming at you
EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:07,455	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	At first it was a pretty rapid pace
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:10,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	More and more of a fast walk
EDL	00:53:11,039	00:53:13,087	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I gave loud verbal commands
EDL	00:53:13,087	00:53:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Stream stop and get on the ground
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:17,183	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	How loud are your verbal commands

EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:29,983	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So
EDL	00:53:29,983	00:53:31,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He says he was running at him
EDL	00:53:31,775	00:53:33,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Misses a huge question
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,359	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Was he running Adam
EDL	00:53:35,871	00:53:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Really running away from

EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Which at the time I thought was
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:24,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Had that work
EDL	00:54:24,511	00:54:26,047	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I thought the taser had struck
EDL	00:54:26,559	00:54:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Make contact
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:31,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I had absolutely no idea if he had a weapon on him or not
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:32,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And

EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I wasn't sure how many rounds I had fired none of them affected him and anyway anyway I didn't think my gun was working
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:52,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I thought I was going to die
EDL	00:54:53,695	00:54:55,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	There's nothing I would do to stop it
EDL	00:54:55,999	00:54:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What was the reason that you continue to fire your weapon
EDL	00:54:59,071	00:55:00,863	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Because he wouldn't stop
EDL	00:55:01,375	00:55:02,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	People trying to get to my gun

EDL	00:55:24,671	00:55:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And we were sitting in that dreary
EDL	00:55:26,719	00:55:28,767	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Deliberation room has no bigger than this living room
EDL	00:55:28,767	00:55:29,279	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Okay
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:30,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's hot
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:33,631	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	We're arguing where it's
EDL	00:55:33,631	00:55:34,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It's it's going nowhere
EDL	00:55:35,423	00:55:36,959	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And so the more it went on this went on for days
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:40,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And he started the leading the charge on that we have to acquit carrack
EDL	00:55:41,055	00:55:44,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Felted officer care can it be right to be afraid
EDL	00:55:44,127	00:55:50,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And he told Kelly that Jonathan Ferrell the guy that shot so what Bruce Rafi sang to me like you know he was a young man
EDL	00:55:50,783	00:55:52,063	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Disheveled confused
EDL	00:55:52,575	00:55:53,599	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Angry
EDL	00:55:53,599	00:55:57,439	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If you will be made a very aggressive move towards police officer
EDL	00:55:57,439	00:55:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	After disobeying commands
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:01,535	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	How many choices in this video
EDL	00:56:01,535	00:56:03,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And it was clear from the very first time I viewed it
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:05,375	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Stop sit down
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:06,143	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Put your hands up
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Do any of those things
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:09,983	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Other than what you chose to do which was Ted charged
EDL	00:56:10,495	00:56:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Lobster care
EDL	00:56:12,031	00:56:14,847	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And told that there's no other way around what I saw
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:16,383	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And then I kept coming back to that
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:20,735	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And this is exactly how the defense painted it right this case is not about race
EDL	00:56:20,735	00:56:21,503	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Viskase
EDL	00:56:21,503	00:56:22,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is about choices
EDL	00:56:22,783	00:56:28,159	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And that's stuck in grease trap he's mine so that when he was asked was it reasonable for character shoot him
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Johnsonville made all these bad choice
EDL	00:56:32,255	00:56:33,279	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This is an old trick
EDL	00:56:33,791	00:56:34,559	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	From from
EDL	00:56:35,327	00:56:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	From my defense attorneys
EDL	00:56:36,863	00:56:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Kelly spoke to Moses Wilson and African-American man he wasn't supposed to be
EDL	00:56:44,031	00:56:46,079	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He might have had a few drinks where he was
EDL	00:56:46,847	00:56:49,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The police responded to what he calls
EDL	00:56:50,687	00:56:52,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This was early in the morning
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This was far from where he lived
EDL	00:56:56,831	00:56:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This was this
EDL	00:56:58,111	00:56:59,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This was that
EDL	00:56:59,391	00:57:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Which caused me
EDL	00:57:00,927	00:57:02,207	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	At the end
EDL	00:57:02,207	00:57:03,999	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To write on the board
EDL	00:57:03,999	00:57:05,279	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Just what did he do
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:08,095	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To deserve to be shot so many times
EDL	00:57:10,399	00:57:11,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Mystery Room
EDL	00:57:11,423	00:57:12,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In the Jury Room
EDL	00:57:12,191	00:57:13,471	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I wrote this on the board
EDL	00:57:13,983	00:57:15,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What did he
EDL	00:57:15,263	00:57:15,775	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Do
EDL	00:57:21,663	00:57:23,199	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What's the what happens with the jury

EDL	00:58:06,207	00:58:07,999	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	There's something interesting about

EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:16,703	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This time
EDL	00:58:17,215	00:58:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Fourth Amendment reasonableness
EDL	00:58:19,007	00:58:20,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Standard this reasonable officer
EDL	00:58:20,287	00:58:21,311	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Standard like what
EDL	00:58:21,823	00:58:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Understand is that it was an attempt to really
EDL	00:58:27,455	00:58:29,503	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Look at these situations these shootings
EDL	00:58:30,015	00:58:31,807	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Uses of force cases
EDL	00:58:31,807	00:58:36,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Through this sort of objective lens where you're just looking at all the fat guy on the ground
EDL	00:58:38,207	00:58:38,975	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And yet
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:45,119	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Kisses don't seem to be tied it like any sort of objectivity or you're like oh that's actually like
EDL	00:58:46,399	00:58:48,703	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That feels like a pier sort of objectivity
EDL	00:58:49,471	00:58:51,775	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like what what what has this guy done yet
EDL	00:58:52,543	00:58:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Actually done any
EDL	00:58:53,567	00:58:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He ran it a buddy
EDL	00:58:55,359	00:58:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Maybe
EDL	00:58:56,127	00:58:56,639	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But that was
EDL	00:58:57,151	00:58:57,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	It
EDL	00:58:57,919	00:58:58,687	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And
EDL	00:59:01,247	00:59:03,807	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like if you're white
EDL	00:59:05,855	00:59:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Are you more likely to say yes that was reasonable because he's white and he was afraid of a black man
EDL	00:59:11,999	00:59:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like that is the question
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:19,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Given the history of our country I'd say many cases that's not even a
EDL	00:59:21,727	00:59:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Thanks question I'm actually left with is
EDL	00:59:24,799	00:59:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If this is where the reasonableness standard is
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is lettuce
EDL	00:59:28,639	00:59:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is there another standard
EDL	00:59:30,175	00:59:31,455	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I think that's right
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:35,295	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This is what he can at again he represented the thorn Graham in that original case
EDL	00:59:36,319	00:59:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	When You See It applied you wonder
EDL	00:59:39,135	00:59:42,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Whether or not this is the best and her there might be something better
EDL	00:59:43,743	00:59:46,047	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I just don't have an answer to that
EDL	00:59:46,559	00:59:49,119	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I would I would suggest the whole more radical
EDL	00:59:49,887	00:59:54,751	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is Elie mystal more perfect legal editor we ended up talking with him about this
EDL	00:59:56,799	00:59:57,567	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Shortly after
EDL	00:59:57,567	00:59:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The philando Castile verdict came out so he was
EDL	01:00:01,407	01:00:05,759	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Well that was a tough pill for him and many people swallow I would suggest that they have to be
EDL	01:00:06,271	01:00:08,063	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The cops have to be right in fact
EDL	01:00:08,575	01:00:14,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Which is something we usually do not apply for what does that mean like it from in the scenario of a police person woo-hoos
EDL	01:00:15,487	01:00:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is that mean like I need to be right that you don't have a toy gun that that's to me
EDL	01:00:20,351	01:00:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So if you shoot me because you think I have a gun I had best have a
EDL	01:00:23,935	01:00:26,239	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And if I don't have a gun your ass is going to jail
EDL	01:00:26,751	01:00:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cuz you were wrong
EDL	01:00:27,519	01:00:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I don't care if you only thought so
EDL	01:00:29,055	01:00:30,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If I was telling you had a gun
EDL	01:00:30,591	01:00:32,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If I if you are not
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:33,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Write in
EDL	01:00:33,151	01:00:34,175	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Back then you
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:35,199	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Have to go to jail
EDL	01:00:35,199	01:00:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I think that is that would be a standard
EDL	01:00:37,503	01:00:39,039	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Sterile hours to process
EDL	01:00:39,039	01:00:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cute Beast Boy
EDL	01:00:40,575	01:00:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cinepolis person's going to just going to argue that like you don't understand the pressures that are under it's a Split Second
EDL	01:00:46,207	01:00:46,975	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Decision

EDL	01:00:48,767	01:00:51,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You do what you just said we're not going to be able to do our jobs
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I'm sick of you
EDL	01:00:53,375	01:00:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I would say screw you if you have had your chance
EDL	01:00:55,935	01:00:57,471	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You had your chance
EDL	01:00:57,471	01:00:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To police my community
EDL	01:00:59,519	01:01:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Without murdering us
EDL	01:01:01,055	01:01:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And you have failed for 300 years
EDL	01:01:04,639	01:01:05,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	That's what I was saying
EDL	01:01:06,431	01:01:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	More people might get hurt if I wasn't
EDL	01:01:08,991	01:01:10,527	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I'm willing to risk that
EDL	01:01:10,527	01:01:12,063	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I'm willing to try it that way then
EDL	01:01:13,087	01:01:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I'd rather I'd rather
EDL	01:01:15,903	01:01:16,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	10

EDL	01:01:27,423	01:01:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Kesha
EDL	01:01:28,191	01:01:31,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	If you want to talk about changing the standards that is a standard change
EDL	01:01:32,287	01:01:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Now that is a zelle said
EDL	01:01:34,847	01:01:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Radical
EDL	01:01:36,639	01:01:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Probably not real
EDL	01:01:38,943	01:01:41,247	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Given that most Americans according to polls
EDL	01:01:41,247	01:01:42,527	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Respectively
EDL	01:01:42,527	01:01:46,623	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I have confidence in the please proceed please to be the enforcers

EDL	01:01:47,647	01:01:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But
EDL	01:01:48,415	01:01:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	There are other ideas
EDL	01:01:49,695	01:01:51,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Out there they're starting
EDL	01:01:51,487	01:01:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Bubble up
EDL	01:01:52,255	01:01:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And it was constraining us if what's keeping us
EDL	01:01:54,815	01:01:57,119	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Stuck where we are are the words of Graham
EDL	01:01:57,631	01:01:59,679	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Then what offers does a way out
EDL	01:01:59,679	01:02:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Could actually
EDL	01:02:01,215	01:02:02,495	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Also be hiding in there
EDL	01:02:03,263	01:02:04,287	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What do you mean
EDL	01:02:04,287	01:02:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Okay so you know how
EDL	01:02:06,335	01:02:09,919	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Chief justice rehnquist when he wrote the decision in 89
EDL	01:02:09,919	01:02:16,063	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He put in all these phrases that took the idea of a regional officer and unconstrained it right
EDL	01:02:16,575	01:02:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	These were like
EDL	01:02:18,367	01:02:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Constraint only two
EDL	01:02:20,671	01:02:25,791	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	This little moment in time it's been trained to the perspective of the officers or constrained that there's no 20-20 hindsight
EDL	01:02:26,303	01:02:27,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	All that stuff
EDL	01:02:27,583	01:02:30,911	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	What in the decision he also he's slipped in this other phrase
EDL	01:02:31,423	01:02:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He's actually calling back to an earlier decision
EDL	01:02:34,751	01:02:36,031	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And what he wrote was
EDL	01:02:37,823	01:02:44,223	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The question is whether the totality of circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure
EDL	01:02:44,223	01:02:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Totality of circumstance
EDL	01:02:45,759	01:02:50,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Totality of circumstances which seems to be at odds with all of the other stuff
EDL	01:02:51,903	01:02:58,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Right which is all about like little slivers and moment
EDL	01:02:58,303	01:03:02,655	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Suggesting that this is like this is the whole thing
EDL	01:03:02,655	01:03:09,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Both both ideas and their wants yet which is why right now you see the lower courts are arguing
EDL	01:03:09,055	01:03:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	About what this phrase actually means until half of the circuits are saying kind of like everything that we've already talked about witches
EDL	01:03:15,455	01:03:18,271	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Is that all the totality circumstances means is that
EDL	01:03:18,783	01:03:25,183	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	You look at everything to answer the question was the officer's scared you look at everything that the officer would have known
EDL	01:03:25,183	01:03:31,071	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Known everything the officer would have seen received and then you ask okay knowing all that was a reason for the awesome music
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:32,351	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In the moment
EDL	01:03:32,351	01:03:33,887	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The other half of the circuit a
EDL	01:03:33,887	01:03:36,191	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Natalia circumstances
EDL	01:03:36,191	01:03:39,007	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Isn't just about what the officer knew what the officer
EDL	01:03:39,007	01:03:40,543	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I saw and how it answers the moment
EDL	01:03:41,055	01:03:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Fatality means like totality
EDL	01:03:43,615	01:03:45,407	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Like what did the officer
EDL	01:03:45,407	01:03:46,175	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Do
EDL	01:03:46,175	01:03:47,199	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Leading up to the mall
EDL	01:03:47,199	01:03:48,479	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Did the officer
EDL	01:03:48,479	01:03:53,087	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Try to get a search warrant to the officer try to deescalate the situation before
EDL	01:03:53,087	01:03:59,487	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Are using voice to be officer try to subdue the person before using deadly force it's only all those things that usual
EDL	01:03:59,487	01:04:00,511	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Out of the frame
EDL	01:04:01,023	01:04:02,303	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Maybe
EDL	01:04:02,303	01:04:04,863	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Can be let back in
EDL	01:04:07,167	01:04:11,775	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Supreme Court so far has shown no interest in ruling on this in trying to sort this out
EDL	01:04:12,799	01:04:13,567	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	But they might
EDL	01:04:14,335	01:04:17,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Because the argument is happening in the lower courts
EDL	01:04:17,919	01:04:24,319	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	So in a way we're kind of living at a time very much like 1984 when does Lauren Graham.
EDL	01:04:24,319	01:04:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Pulled over outside of convenience store in Charlotte
EDL	01:04:27,903	01:04:30,719	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Waiting to see whether it matters that the thorn Graham
EDL	01:04:30,719	01:04:31,999	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Wasn't trying to steal anything
EDL	01:04:33,023	01:04:34,047	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Maybe just a diabetic
EDL	01:04:35,327	01:04:36,095	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Chinese Mauritius
EDL	01:04:43,775	01:04:46,079	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Did what happened your dad affect how you

EDL	01:05:15,263	01:05:16,799	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	On a tobacco farm
EDL	01:05:16,799	01:05:18,079	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In that small town
EDL	01:05:18,079	01:05:20,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I can remember him telling me a story of
EDL	01:05:20,895	01:05:21,663	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	A black man
EDL	01:05:22,687	01:05:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Who have been accused
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Being inappropriate with a white woman
EDL	01:05:29,855	01:05:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And how the white
EDL	01:05:31,647	01:05:32,671	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Got him in broad daylight
EDL	01:05:33,183	01:05:34,463	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Castrated him in broad daylight
EDL	01:05:36,767	01:05:38,559	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And I say that
EDL	01:05:39,071	01:05:39,583	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	In saying that
EDL	01:05:40,351	01:05:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Although he experienced all that stuff growing up
EDL	01:05:43,935	01:05:46,239	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	And the racism that he experienced growing up
EDL	01:05:47,263	01:05:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He didn't teach that to us
EDL	01:05:49,055	01:05:50,847	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	He didn't teach that has he told us
EDL	01:05:51,359	01:05:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	To love people
EDL	01:05:52,639	01:05:53,151	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	People

EDL	01:05:55,711	01:05:56,223	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Cell
EDL	01:05:56,735	01:05:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I base my experience of a person
EDL	01:05:59,295	01:06:00,575	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	I base my experience of the
EDL	01:06:00,575	01:06:01,087	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	The police
EDL	01:06:01,855	01:06:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17mrgrahammp |	Based on my dealings with
