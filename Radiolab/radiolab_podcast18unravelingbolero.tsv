EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Unites
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Two people across space and time in a really bizarre way
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Kind of rhyme
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:10,368	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	First Story begins in the 1980s in Vancouver British Columbia with a woman named and Adams
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:13,696	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Who by all accounts was a brilliant cell biology
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Oh yes and was highly articulate
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	That's her husband Robert Adams you know extremely capable with language
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She did cancer research he actually develop the cell line
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	That I believe still exist
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	So she was very sharp
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	He says that as a scientist she was a natural but then
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Rather Suddenly at the age of 46
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And kind of did a 180
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Something happened in 86 which change the course of her life
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	It all started when their third son Alex gets into a really bad car accident
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	We were told that he would probably never ever walk again
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And decided she's going to take some time off to help him recover and he does he does learn to walk again
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	The wild home
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She just decides to quit
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Quit science
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And become a painter
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Dan
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,871	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Made up her mind then and there
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	That she was going to
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Take apart
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Full-time
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Had she ever painted for well she did a fair amount of it when she was in high school
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Which is a very long time ago so the whole thing struck him is kind of out of the blue but he rolled with it and
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Within a short. Of time she converted a room in their house into a studio and she
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Painting houses
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And buildings
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Little churches
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Simple at first but after that brightly colored versions of what you see when you look down the barrel
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	A microscope Neo cells bacteria after that strawberries
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	A series of paintings involving these Blazing Red strawberries
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	A water faucet
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:46,111	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	A note of what would becoming a stream of strawberries
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Play there was things called strawberry Universe where the strawberries have rings around them like Saturn and I don't
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	I think there was something like 35 or 36
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Strawberry painting
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	But then she would switch to something else even after their son had fully recovered even through Waze crutches
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Went back to school
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And kept on painting and she would work
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	All day long
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	10 hours a day making these paintings that got bigger and bigger and more abstract and there were times he says
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	When he was like
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Wow
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,879	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Because for someone who hadn't painted since high school
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She was suddenly so prolific
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And it's entirely possible
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:30,399	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	There's something was happening to her even then
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Way below the surface I mean on the surface she was painting it was working
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	People buying the painting she's having solo shows she was becoming a successful artist
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Then in 1994
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She decided I don't know what gave her this idea
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	I never knew what gave her any of her ideas
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	But time she decided she was going to do a painting
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Well

EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Anything cebollero the music and then the painting
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In both their case

EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	6 couple of steps to explain bear with me
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Start the disease called frontotemporal dementia and
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,815	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	It's begins when certain cells in your frontal cortex which is your forehead
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Begin to wither away
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In some cases literally leaving holes
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:14,751	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In your frontal cortex and we know this about an
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:21,663	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Some tests and brain scans we suspected about Ravel because Queen RV just before he died on December 28th
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	1937 French surgeon open up a skull
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,759	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And saw that
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	One of the lobes of the
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	2 lobes of the brain
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Had sunk
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Disintegrate
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Now in both of their cases the part of their brain part of their cortex got hit
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	What's on the left
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Is it part of the brain does a lot of things I had lodged with memory but most importantly for our story this is the part of your brain that
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Largely governs language
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,871	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	People who suffer from frontotemporal dementia
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	They lose
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	They can no longer string words together
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And here's something about losing something like language
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	It has all kinds of other effects
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In the brain because
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Bruce you know our brain is a series of interconnected circuit
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:09,023	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And when
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In a normal brain a dominant circuit like language turns on
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	It is basically wired
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	To turn a bunch of other circuits off basically goes
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Two other parts of the brain we have this constant Dancewear
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	1 circuit or many circuits turn on and then their obligatory really turning off other circuits
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	So language acts as a kind of brake on other things to bring Timmy doing
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Like daydreaming
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:35,391	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Taking a picture
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	But
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	When the language is no longer there to hold things back Austin
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	What happens if those other parts
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Let's say the visual part scan
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Rushford
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Suddenly the mind is just
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Flooded with images and you hear
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Reports of people having these intensely visual experiences Express is very common
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	We see a number of patients would become visually obsessed he says he sees you no investment bankers who never shown any in
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Interest in are never
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Even walked into an art museum
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	All of a sudden they decide in their 50s well I'm going to move into a loft take up painting that's right
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	How many of these cases have you seen
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	56
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:16,351	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Steal some of them has sculpted some of them
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Painted he said he's seen people take up gardening graphic design
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:24,543	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And what's so many of the cases have in common is that the sort of visual creativity that burst forth
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	It's not the free-flowing kind it's very mechanical
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	The repetition Obsession they get stuck in a kind of loop taking one visual ID and doing it again and again and it
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Again
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Like an Anne Adams Painting
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Bolero
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,023	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	This said drive to repeat
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Happens very early in the course of this illness
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Teresa
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	What can seem like a simple creative
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Choice to repeat a melody
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	May actually be driven by a condition
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	But you won't even know you have for six years we think that this had something to do with a very unusual
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Rhythmic repetitive sorts of music that
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Revell produce
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	I asked Bruce so why the repetition where does
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Where does that come from
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And I think this is a release of of
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	You said we don't really know
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	The effort of a theory which I find fascinating
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Which make it to the root of creative Obsession of any kind
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	He says there might be
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Several parts of the brain that are held back by the language
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	With circuit and one of them
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Is this very ancient part of the brain
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,527	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	The basal ganglia the part of the brain we move with
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	You can call a reptile brain is the part of us that governs basic Behavior
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Eating running
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Motor programs that we do repetitively everyday
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Eat run run birds and snakes
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Get by with
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Basically just this part of the brain
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Keep them alive
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Normally he thinks the language part of us
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Inhibits these habits these repetitive motor
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Programs
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	When the language part of the brain is not there to do the shushing these motor commands filter up to
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	So imagine you're one of these people your mind is
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Flooded with all of the
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	These images may be sound
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:18,208	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Also flooded with all of these
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,536	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Kinetic repetitive instructions move
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Move move do it again in the early stages of the illness
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	You still have enough brain to make sense of it all
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:31,008	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	There's still a lot of Cortex that is still available to
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Act upon this desire to repeat
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	So you get art that is obsessive and repetitive but also beautiful
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	An abstract
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Like
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,248	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And painting unraveling bolero
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	But then resets as the disease progresses in more of that sort of Cortex a human apart
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Hate the way the repetition becomes much simpler
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	In the latter stages of a disease he says you'll often see patients pouring water into a cup hundred times

EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	This is sort of what you see in Anne's work her painting start off simple exploded abstraction and then get simple again
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	What's unusual compared to the other patients is that she kept painting almost all the way to the
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:28,096	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Literally it was not possible for her to to hold and direct a pressure of pain

EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And that. Is that what she said
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Towards the end he said he would go into her studio and I would see her there in front of a blank canvas
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She wouldn't be doing anything
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She would just be looking at it

EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,328	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Couple of hours later
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	And she still wouldn't have done anything
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	She had lost the ability to do the yard
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18unravelingbolero |	Anatomy is one of the
