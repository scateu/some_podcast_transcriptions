EDL	00:00:37,888	00:00:40,960	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To it pulled me into the studio to walk me through this
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:43,520	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Story that they've been working on together for
EDL	00:00:43,520	00:00:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Everybody

EDL	00:00:49,664	00:00:54,016	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You guys are just going to tell me the story or could rather tell you a riddle okay
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:00:58,368	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Once Upon a Time Birds evolve
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,904	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They evolve from dinosaurs
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:04,000	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So they was originally scary things in the scales turn to feathers in the
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:07,072	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Feathery things began to fly we call those things Birds
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:12,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But they haven't lately I just I'm going to just ask this to you out of the blue because it's a basic appendage
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	How many birds
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,008	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Have
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Penis
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:19,616	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Oh oh oh can I buy before you answer
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There are like 10 to 20 thousand different kinds of birds button by modern time
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So again how many of those
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,296	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Have penis
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:33,696	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	At what percentage of currently existing bird bird species have in the mail
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:40,096	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	With the penises as we would identify like a hangout
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is it making weird penis
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Zolman Tire
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:54,176	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Do you know how many times we said penises are there in 27 and 4 minutes
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:54,688	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Birds have penis
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Well
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I have
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Absolutely no frame of reference answer this question I don't know I mean
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	30
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:08,000	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Lower
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Dead
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,352	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	10 lower
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,656	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	5
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Lower
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	One three
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:18,752	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	3
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	3%
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah 97% of birds
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Don't have penis
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wow yeah
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:29,504	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So we learned this little fact from a scientist named Patty Brennan
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,600	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So weird about birds is precisely the fact that they they lost a penis
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Will you just said
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You just use an interesting. So that you say the birds lost the penis is so does that mean that
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Earlier editions of birds it have them
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:46,912	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That's right yes of penises are widespread traits of old
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Vertebrates right except for you know some amphibians
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And fish
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And according to Patty if you go back 200 million years or so
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,152	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Birds were like all those other creature
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah like basically 100% of them had penises sexy right over time
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Vast majority of birds apenas was then lost
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Now
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Well that's the question how do you lose a penis like
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It seems like a pretty handy thing to have when you want to put your sperm close to female eggs to the 97%
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:25,568	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Don't have a penis now what do they have David kind of hold the mail and the females have these holes in the shirt
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Open up anime line them up yeah it's called a cloaca
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:38,368	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Play Commander MTG and that's it that's it and it works just fine but if you're thinking about the engineering what appendages
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is going to work best for you to make babies
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,512	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Penis is the one because it gets your sperm closer to female eggs
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So far all of these penises to just vanish like she says that evolutionarily that just doesn't make any
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Acquired you lose a thing
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What's so useful for there to be selection for the penis to to go away
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,616	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There's going to be a very important reason
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What's the reason
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,920	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Well there's a few possibilities
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:09,088	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Number one people have speculated for example that you might have been sexually transmitted diseases
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:16,768	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You're putting this Pinos way deep into the female and then you're pulling your penis back into your click I like that could be potentially
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Easy Exchange of of sexually transmitted
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:27,007	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Cuz you're like digging the germs deeper I guess exactly yeah yeah yeah so even though the penis has its advantages obviously
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Maybe it's only one way because the birds that had the penises just kept getting these inspections that's
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But so far nobody's found a link between penises and STDs so then the other possibility that's really intriguing actually
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:44,415	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is the babies because
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Penises are heavy
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,511	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Number to start flying
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And getting rid of the penos would have been an easy thing for lowering your body weight
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,471	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Maybe they lost him so they could fly further items
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,263	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I mean I think that's
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,591	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Unlikely to have Phoenix strong enough selection
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:07,199	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because ducks for example are among the most long-distance migrants
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:12,831	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And they still have penises Theron to 3% and sometimes they have penises that are bigger than
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Theron body
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,367	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:20,767	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Patriots to my god you watch a penis go by with wings
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Oh my God yes I think the record is a male that had a 43c
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Centimeter long penis
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And this is a male that was only about 40 centimeters long himself
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,591	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So apparently you going to be pretty large penis and fly just
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The Ducks are also sort of the key to a third Theory
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,295	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Pretty disappearance of the penis so yeah so I was going to say my favorite
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This is some this idea that actually had to do with female choice
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Against
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Males that controls Ripper.
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To explain Patty actually thinks that the original bird penises
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Might have been a lot like the modern-day
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Duck penis
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Which is essentially
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A weapon
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:11,967	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I'm so one of the things that we learned when we were studying the Ducks is that
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Do males have a bolt Direction mechanism that is
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,343	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Crazy they have Annex
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Close his erection mechanism
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What that means is that the male actually efforts his penis and ejaculates in a third of a cell
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,095	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Basically a a a pistol
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Penis looking mushroom yeah it just goes between yes
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:35,519	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wow what what does though is that it allows these males
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To forcefully inseminate females even when females don't want to be inseminated right safety smell
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is anywhere near a female is just going to go and push right through
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And so as you can imagine that's not
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You know
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That's not something you Starley desirable for female
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Often times with females will be
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Struggling
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They're trying to get away from these
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:01,887	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Emails that are trying to forcibly copulate
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So Patty thinks that will might have happened here is that female Birds trying to get away from males with
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Large penises and
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	He's really violent ways of
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Approaching reproduction
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Begin systematically choosing gentler and smaller males with smaller penises right so so if females
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,063	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Closest are selecting males that are less
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Violently sexually violent did that my
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,695	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Lead to the disappearance
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But I think you just said is
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,815	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Overtime because the ladies were
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,375	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The ladies were just comforted
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,399	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The gentleman
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Changed
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,703	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And lost their penis
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You got it
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She think that that's females essentially castrated males well is a slower process
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:50,271	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Castration / time
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,039	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yes I suppose
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Now what meme
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,183	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What makes you what what evidence is there for such a thing
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,231	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So no I mean
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Norman in a way because we're talking about penises which are soft tissue
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And they don't fossilize so even if we went back into the fossil record
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,727	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It would be really hard to fight
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Find evidence of Wadsworth have
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So that's the part that is difficult you know it's kind of like a wonderful story
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:23,295	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That that I think makes a lot of sense given what we know about the way these penises work now
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,575	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	We can only
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Speculate
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I like this idea
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But is this just a one-off I mean
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:34,559	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What about Gorillas in Moose who fighting
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Clash their horns I mean there's so many species where it just seems like the females have zero choice
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So I know they there are a lot of cases like that of bedbugs are especially horrifying Google it
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Talk about bed bugs but
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There are actually a lot of cases where
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	When the females do get to choose
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,783	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Bape shoes in ways that
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Completely change
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What we see in nature are we found a group of scientist who now are
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Cute but if you look around nature you will see females driving evolution in ways that I certainly didn't expect
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:10,399	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And when they get into the details of how this actually works I think it's going to
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Flip your ideas about evolution
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,775	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In a way that you are totally unprepared for
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:19,615	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Do they have evidence for this idea cuz I got to say to you haven't yet convinced me of the first thing they said
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That females have
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,687	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Evolve the penises away
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I guess that was a guess
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I will introduce you to a bird called a bowerbird
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That I think will spell it speaks for itself in these regards
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And it's also his penis list
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They're really
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They have
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:42,655	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful plumage the satin bowerbird is a
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful iridescent blue with a
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Violet blue eyes this is Gail Gail patricelli and I'm a professor of evolution at a and ecology at
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	UC Davis
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Well I say that again without stuttering on and
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	No no
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Anyway so the Bower birds what makes them
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,599	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Most amazing is that they build
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Bowers
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,415	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So about our
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Listings of birds
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,463	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Build
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Basically a structure made out of
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Text which can be up to 3 feet tall and it repeats
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Loving it in some of these things now
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah and
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It looks like an s
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:22,335	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But it's really a kind of Seduction theater with one seat
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that nms for her this is Richard from of Yale University sat biology
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is there any system on and around this bow
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The mail will a real whole bunch of
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Down.
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,159	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Precious objects
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,671	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Parrot feathers and berries and flowers and leaves stuff that the bird gathers from the forest episode East
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Structures can be very ornamented and elaborate every species has its own
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Style and some species of all be blue everything
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Blue feathers
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:59,199	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Blue flowers and then of course blue trash like drinking straws and bottle caps
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,807	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In the mail by bird
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Basically dedicate this whole life learning how to build these structures
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What take the satin bowerbird they take 7 years before they reach sexual maturity and during that. Of time they look
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Just like females
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,631	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	An elephant fly around the valley and get
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Courted by adult males
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So they play the role of the female
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And learn how courtship works from other males
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,591	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In the valley and then when they get a little older that's teenagers
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,359	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	All-Star building practice
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Court each other and eventually once about a bird figures out how to make a really good stuff
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Female has arrived
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	SLL fly down to the bower and now often check out the bower itself
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:48,095	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Symmetrical like a well-built
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,423	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And if she likes what she sees
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Slender the Bower
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,543	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This is where things get interesting
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because the bower has a very particular
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Purposeful architecture
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,063	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So it's two parallel walls
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Styx
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It better close to one another
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And the female sits between them
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:21,119	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Three different variations on the basic design but in all cases the female is in a protector
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Did position
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There's always some kind of barrier or wall between her and the mail so the male wants to try
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Try to force himself on her for whatever reason
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,175	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	He has to run around the back and she can just fly away out the front
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:42,879	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Even as he's trying to win her attention completely he's built a building that keeps her out of disk
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Absolutely the bower is like
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Insurance against date rape
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	For the female
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It allows the female to observe him at an intimate close distance for as long as she likes
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,191	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	While still maintaining our freedom of choice
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So the female if she likes
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The Bower
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,079	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So settle into this protected space
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Where she can back out whenever she likes
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,247	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And then time to begin the show
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So he'll start out with his own
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	His own displays many of them
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:21,535	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Very loud electronic sound sounds
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They do they do imitations of kookaburra
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,007	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Cockatoos
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Then along singing
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Didn't they pop up on a run vigorously back and forth right in front of
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The female and she's standing between the walls of the
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So the female watches all this from her seat
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,183	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Spot for as long as she likes and she can decide
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She would like
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To meet with this guy or
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Not good enough
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,071	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Stop and fly away
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	For the female
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:58,655	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The moment
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Pisco
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,823	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That was particularly interesting here is a gale has done studies
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You said show
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Windmill
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A very close attention to the female like when the male really watches her body position
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The way that she's like pastured that can actually signal whether she's interested or not the males that respond to most of those signals are
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Are the most successful in mating
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In other words if the male makes his move too early and too aggressively
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She's gone
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:29,375	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that mail doesn't have any babies
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But it also seems like the females are
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Have toying with the males like seeing what they're willing to
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Do for them like
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	If you if you watch a video of this
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You can see in one bowerbird
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,247	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She comes in he like
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A list of his wing with
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:52,415	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Kate and then just like sort of rotates his wing like this like
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:58,047	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's so funny like a like a like a like a matador and then
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,839	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Right after that
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She like
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Picks up
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,655	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A blueberry
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	From the ground
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Henan
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:10,079	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She drops the blueberry and then he does the Matador thing with the blueberry in his mouth
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Good vibe
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Seems to be all about her
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	May I see what you mean
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah I did females are definitely driving driving the bus
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And when you start to really think about the implications of this about it being all about her
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:47,455	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That can lead you to a fairly deep rethink of the very basic rules of how evolution
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:47,967	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Really
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Normally the classical argument with credit like the reason this male bird is so color
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Apple so red or whatever
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,767	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The reason the peacock has the gigantic and
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,559	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful feathers on its tail
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is sort of a signal
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:08,959	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That the mail is sending to the female of Fitness look at me
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I am healthy to have a tail like this I don't have parasites I'm strong

EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah that's definitely not what I learned
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So it's
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Over a hundred thirty years later and I'm still pissed
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,863	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You think there was some kind of plot
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,399	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To reduce
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Darwin's idea into
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,983	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Does something smaller
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And eventually
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Eliminated in tire
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I would like to go historical let's go out with Darwin
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Let's go Wallace said
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,431	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And then let's go
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Did the 20th century and where we got so screwed up
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Charles Darwin spent 20 years working on his theory of natural selection
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	He was not particularly noisy about it
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because you knew it would
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Very much
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Disturb his wife was quite religious and other people in his church so during the twenty years while Darwin was working away
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This other guy comes on
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	His name is Alfred Russel Wallace
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Kind of skinny in scrapy and self-taught 14 years younger than Charles Darwin
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:02,271	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Went around the world collecting specimens and he also
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Came up with a theory of natural selection
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Independent
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What was the relationship
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To each other I mean today where they friends were they collaborators were they
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Hope you know they were
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:15,583	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Close
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Collaborators first they kind of both got credit
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	For the idea
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A little later Darwin rocket it out his book into interpress
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:28,127	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What he publishes On the Origin of Species
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Very popular book Darwin got the Lion's Share of the credit as I think rightly so
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,319	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Has he been working on the idea for literally for decades
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In 20 years later Darwin dies
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Meanwhile Wallace lived in until the dawn of War
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I drink if I'm this is Rick's argument after Darwin die
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wallace kept saying over and over and over again
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Then when it came to female Choice animals
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I didn't have the sensory and cognitive capacity to make aesthetic judgments and nature so these is love
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,895	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Amber decorations and be artistic
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Behaviors can only evolve if it communicates
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Information about

EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:14,719	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And Rick would say that because Darwin wasn't around to argue back
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wallace may have lost
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The the battle
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Over

EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,856	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Doesn't feel to me
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Opposite of Fitness like I like that could be

EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Did the why there she's just having a desire but behind that desire is
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Maybe a drive to get her to leave mail that is the best
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like it could be the same with us too with people

EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's like a truck backing up
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Exactly
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So he's not using his voice that it's just as Wings kids got this instrument
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,472	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah it's like it's
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,240	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She called Street relation
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:06,592	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So this is a cricket winged Manakin would be a perfectly good name for the spark
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:12,480	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In any case something about that sound that specific
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:12,992	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Sound
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,272	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Excites the female
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	We don't know why but when it started but somewhere in the birds
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Past a female decided she likes that sound and so the mail just started to make it
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:26,304	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In order to make that sound yeah they
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,424	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Really have paid
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They have they have paid
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:34,240	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,032	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To vibrate your wings that fast
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:42,176	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	107 times per second you need
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A rigid Wing phone that you can really control
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And so the club winged Manakin has done something unheard of
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Their wingbonz went solid
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Just like a rock inside there
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,632	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This is a big deal because
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,680	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Flying birds
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Have Halloween
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Actually can fly
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:09,568	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Actually even Velociraptor and T-Rex
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:12,384	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Chav Halo
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So this is a feature that predates the origin of birds and the origin of
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:18,272	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What this guy has given this up
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In order to make
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:20,576	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	These
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:22,368	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Extraordinary wingsong
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:25,440	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What does not hurt your ability to fly vs
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:25,952	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Set yes
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They are slow
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Heavy
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:33,888	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Unable to LEAP buildings in a single bound cost of doing business
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:37,728	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A display right
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,312	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Think about that you're in a crowded Forest
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,128	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Lots of competitors. The Predators trying to eat you
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:46,176	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And you've made yourself
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Slower
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	More vulnerable
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And it gets worse
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,528	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Mannequins
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	How to start this process of building these hard bones really early
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like when they're very very tiny
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In the embryo for the embryo has become either male or female
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So you got an embryo that can go either way and they're already making the big bones and some of them are going to be mailed
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,496	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But some of them are going to be female
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So by choosing males with weird Wing Bones because they make great songs
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The female also has daughters
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,432	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	With distorted
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:19,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And inferior Wing Bar
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That they will never use
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,600	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Both the females and the males
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Skip these thick bones
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So she is choosing to hear that sent
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And has designed him to produce that
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,328	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In the bargain
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,888	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	He comes out with heavier bonsai
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:38,400	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I can fly last
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:39,936	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And weirdly enough
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She comes out with heavier bones
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I can file EX
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:44,544	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So both of them
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,336	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Are hurting
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:47,360	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Their chances
EDL	00:32:47,872	00:32:48,384	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Just survive
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:50,688	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	For the chance
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I hear the beautiful tone
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She wants to hear that he wants to give her
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,064	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wait so
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,112	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So she has every buns to
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:01,696	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But she doesn't use them know Rick's Auto mediately like
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,768	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I think all this is where the females got the bumps on her bones too and he's like
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like what
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:15,776	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I can females have it but they don't use it she's bearing the cost
EDL	00:33:15,776	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Of her own choices decadence
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:19,104	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This is like
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	20 years ago
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:30,624	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What did he mean so everybody in the population be
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:34,720	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Becomes worse off because females are so choosy and shoes
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beauty
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So from Rick's point of view you got a contest going on here
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:43,168	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Two Primal drives
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:46,240	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And on the one hand there's the desire to survive
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Survival of the fittest right
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And according to that logic
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,152	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The mannequin should go for the things that make him
EDL	00:33:53,152	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Swift and powerful and agile
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But on the other hand lyrics
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A second Drive
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or in this case to hear something
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:02,880	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They like
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:03,904	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Something Beautiful
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:06,720	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In this case
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:10,816	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That second Drive is so strong that it's winning
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's pushing the birds
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Away from Fitness
EDL	00:34:17,728	00:34:20,544	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So so we've gone we've gone through the math
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And others have as well and there is nothing in theory nothing to prevent
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,200	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Discard process
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	From leading to Extinction
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:31,552	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Oh my God
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:37,440	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Right you just you just turned what I totally think of evolution on its head
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:38,976	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like we've always been taught
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:45,632	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That what these animals are doing is they're adopting as best as they can to new and changing conditions and
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:46,912	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Getting
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:47,680	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Better
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:51,264	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But here you say that they are so
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Hung up on desire and beauty that they even are going to get worse
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,896	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Write what you know
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,432	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That's why this example is
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:01,504	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Checkmate but there are biologists
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:03,808	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Eminently
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Hello
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:08,416	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You want to be sucking a lollipop whatever you're doing it again
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:14,048	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like Jerry Queen of the University of Chicago
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,352	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What is it is it a lollipop
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,912	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Orange cough drops
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So Jerry redrix book and there's not not convinced
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	By his acumen
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,824	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Well I think it's a good book
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But it's not a great book it's good because
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It has really great
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:36,320	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Stories about mating behavior which are accurate stories as far as I know and they're quite absorbent
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Promise a good writer
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:43,744	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The recent side great book is that it's tendentious that is as written to promote a Cause
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Which is of course that males with
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful ornaments are shaped by female sense of beauty
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,400	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Not Fitness
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,704	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I think that the word Fitness is a huge problem
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And I don't use it anymore
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:59,104	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That you can't just say that and have it accepted by scientists unless you can test it
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:01,152	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that is
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Ruggeri when it comes to the stories that we just heard like the bowerbird or the mannequin he thinks that more is going on
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I'm here then what
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,856	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Richard says in his book
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:14,464	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You know take the female bowerbirds preference for Bowers at keep her apart
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,232	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	From mail
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:16,000	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I mean Richard
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,792	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Explanation that
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It allows the female
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,120	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	More
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Time to choose it doesn't freak her out because she feels protected that might be the right right explanation
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But we don't know how many could be that females have an innate preference
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's for being sheltered
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,152	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because it gives them a sense of
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:33,664	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Social Security
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Like cats
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Cats like to beatbox
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,016	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	This right because
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They feel sheltered and they feel safe and it could be that female bowerbirds
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,880	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The same way
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that would lead to exactly the same situation but with a
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Completely different explanation and it's not just
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,024	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A random aesthetic
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or he says maybe some female bowerbirds like blue so much because
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,936	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Blueberries are really good for them and
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:57,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is there an 8 we drawn to blue because of
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or that let go to the American Tail
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What that no 1500 Hearthstone Rick says that
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,920	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Simply Delights the female's butt
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Suppose that the females prefer males
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:08,992	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	They have a certain freak
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,016	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Seawing beating
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:12,832	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because they were attuned to that frequency perhaps
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Because it indicates
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Something in their environment
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,952	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's useful to unlike the presence of a predator
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Could be anything really
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:24,096	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Sound of some romantic and friendly animal or the
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,632	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Protective animal maybe the
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Although they were babies baby chicks and so they just have their nervous system innately tune
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Set frequency
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,312	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	See that's called sensory bias
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Another theory
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:38,432	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So they carry doesn't dispute the fact of female birds like
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Bowers
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:40,736	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or that they like
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Beautiful tone
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:47,392	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	He just think that there might be a reason behind their liking and that reason could include
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Fitness
EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:53,792	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Correct but are you are you hoping I guess is that the right word hoping that there might be
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:59,936	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A parasite signals involved here like you don't know you just want to know I don't know I mean that's my whole point
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:06,080	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that's why I don't think I don't propose my own theory of special selection I'm not sure which one is
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,664	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Doesn't count for these mannequins with the heavy bones we just don't know
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:16,064	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Oh my God this can't just keep this conversation we're having keeps ending up in the same place which is we just don't know
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:21,440	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The difference between me and Doctor promise I have been I don't know
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:25,536	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The suggestion here is it Rick is clinging to a
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:28,608	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Faith in one explanation for
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,888	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Wallace it was Fitness
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The Rickey
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:31,936	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's Beauty but still that
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Dogmatic insistence I just think that adaptation by natural selection is is
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:38,592	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Pretty boring
EDL	00:38:40,640	00:38:43,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You know we've been going to 150 years in week
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:50,368	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Whip-whip that pony quite a bit and we made a whole bunch of progress but you know what there's this huge world
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,648	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Trinity in the static evolution
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,952	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Bet that has been missed
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:57,024	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In fact Rick would say
EDL	00:38:57,024	00:38:58,816	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Of essential beauty is it can be
EDL	00:38:58,816	00:39:00,352	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Many many different
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,680	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It is
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:05,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Gangnam beauty is fundamentally subjective
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:16,480	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So the aesthetic model requires that we put the subjective experience desire itself at the center
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Of our of our scientific explanation
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But can you even have it a science
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:23,136	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	The basement
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,160	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Experience
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	IFixit
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,744	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Data science of subjective experience
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	It's not only
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,560	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	A good idea it's necessary
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,352	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To understand the natural world
EDL	00:39:39,776	00:39:40,544	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,824	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There is idiosyncrasy
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:44,384	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Again ornithologist kimbap
EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You can't take the individuals out of it
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:47,968	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So you don't
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,272	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is that science or is that just
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Okay it really comes down to
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:59,232	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	She's a Carp Lakes with that male carp has she the worm lights with the worm has she the bird like what the bird has
EDL	00:39:59,232	00:40:04,096	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You have a trillion explanation each one different depending upon the lady didn't want to see you go
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:11,520	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Where are you at that so-called Beauty and desire a category of an explanation as to not
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,032	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Tell you very much
EDL	00:40:13,056	00:40:14,592	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That doesn't worry me at all
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:16,640	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	II doesn't worry me at all
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:18,432	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	You
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:22,528	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	All of us we are individuals we have unique
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,040	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	History
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:26,624	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And life on this planet has a unique history
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:30,464	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Science has a hard time dealing with unique instances
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,792	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But biology is it just in your face with it
EDL	00:40:33,792	00:40:40,192	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	There are individual females making choices if that individual female had not made that choice history might have been.
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:41,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Different in the species might look different
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:42,752	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And that
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,776	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Is true
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,544	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	That's just
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,056	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	True
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,600	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	In in physics
EDL	00:40:59,392	00:41:01,184	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Conceit that but a scientist
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:01,952	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Supposed to do is take
EDL	00:41:02,720	00:41:03,232	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Clueless
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:06,560	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Variety that you see in front of you and say look
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	I can boil this down to a rule
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,400	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Which is always true
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:12,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Yeah we usually had one rule
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:13,728	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Everything
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	So what did John of science usually is this
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:18,848	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Find some kind of Oneness inside the Menace
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But now we've got
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Nature and living thing
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:24,992	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	And they have this crazy spec
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Tacular variety
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:28,832	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Now you've got a group of people who say you don't Maybe
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	We shouldn't even try
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:33,696	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	To explain all this
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:36,000	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	With one
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:38,048	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Laurel or one
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Paradise
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,608	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	But you know I wonder
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,400	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	If
EDL	00:41:43,680	00:41:44,448	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	If that's
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:45,984	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Still science
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:47,008	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Or is it more like
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	History
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,919	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	What if every species or every animal
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:55,711	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Comes with its own store in Century
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19beautypuzzle |	Once upon a time and then
