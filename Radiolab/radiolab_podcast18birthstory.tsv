EDL	00:00:29,952	00:00:36,352	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Seemingly ordinary but in truth utterly bizarre and magical and deeply weird and ethically
EDL	00:00:36,352	00:00:36,864	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Brought
EDL	00:00:37,376	00:00:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Business of humans making more of themselves

EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It turns out how that was going to happen
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is a crazy story involving
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	4 countries
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And hundreds of thousands of dollars

EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	My career is kind of night vision
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I gave it to him and I said this and this is what I want
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Define at the bottom place
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It was a contract it's like this is what I want if you want to join me
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So let's do it until what was your reaction to the
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To the manifesto
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I like it
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's look like
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Someone new
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	1
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Future
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	If your own parents have any either of your parents have any views about that
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Think don't do or think so weird
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Jack
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Suffice to say their families
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Did not approve
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Especially
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	When it came to the idea of them having kid
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How to have those kids
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That is a quest
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Basically there are two options if you're a gay couple and you want to have kids
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	There used to be three options at CU Chi my towel from Israel story here is how he Maya laid it out for us optional
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Number one which is not as much of an option you could adopt a kid from a third world country
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Recess over the last few years what happened is it those third world countries figured out who was adopting their babies and one by
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I want
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The Bandit for gay couple
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah the second option which is becoming very very popular Nizoral is sort of the new family sodas called in Hebrew
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Sort of getting together with another woman who wants to be a mother but doesn't have a father
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then they do a joint Parenthood they all live in the same house kind of like divorced parents
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I get along really well
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:37,311	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Before the processing everything is like in the contract tell them you said that earlier
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They try this route
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:44,479	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Target in Ephraim one of these friend to where they do the co-parenting
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But then
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I spoke with Dad and ask him listen it's very important for me to have a baby of my own
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Hey with my sperm
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And I said to him
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,767	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I want to try but I don't carry
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In the end we have only one baby
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,095	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In your sperms
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It will be my baby
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The same
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,983	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I think I was more stubborn
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Amir could really explain why it was so important to him just
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:11,871	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That was important
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But reflecting on it later Maya from Israel story put it this way
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's very Jewish and Israeli I mean
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Fisher nuts
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In the Israeli mainstream if you're gay or if you are different
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And you'll have your own baby
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's like a signature of being part of the game
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You know whatever the reasons Amir and tal talked it over
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then they went back to the swim until
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Offered to do the co-parenting and we ask her if she can obligate us to bring
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Two children one of them
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	House burns in one of my own
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Indian she said
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	No
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,967	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	At this point a year ago
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So then we decided that maybe the best
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Option will be option three is
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is surrogacy
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Of course if you're gay man that you take your sperm

EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:35,391	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This kind of process in five times
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And it still didn't succeed
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	5 * yeah
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They figured with that kind of risk
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Doing in the US list
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Too expensive
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Until they started looking at surrogacy agencies
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Which operate in India and Nepal
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because over there you can do the same thing and it will cost you about $60,000
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Does almost half price almost a half price yet
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Now
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	What are the things called Lehigh is it in 2013
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Basically outlawed surrogacy
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For gay couples I mean you if you can do surrogacy in India
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	By the way in the pot also outlawed surrogacy if you are Nepali woman you cannot be a surrogate
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Period but there's sort of a loophole
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Indian women are allowed to be surrogates in the pilot just Nepali women aren't allowed to be surrogates and if so what ends up happening
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This really strange situation looks like it Basel
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	These agents in Northern India will find Indian women
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Move them across the border into Nepal I'll take them all the way to Kathmandu where the surrogacy agencies have
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Set up shelter houses in work with local Hospitals and Clinics
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	My sister
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Vuitton damier the decision
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To do it this way
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Was not easy
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They they had like different opinions.
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Had the bigger issue with the moral
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Concept of this process
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,567	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It was like
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This is the thing that we need to do I want to be a father. How was
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Was very hard for him if it's
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's immoral to do
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Things like that
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To use
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Another woman to
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Give
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Me
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Present like that
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And I know she will never
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We'll see
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This baby anymore
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is it immoral because you're essentially like just
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,567	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Using a woman's body or
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You can say cuz like he's using
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Other people
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Bad luck
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For his own good
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah she has no choice
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She's not doing it
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Out of freedom
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She's just doing it for the money and maybe not morally okay that's will
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Use this weakness
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tell him you went back and forth on this for months and eventually the argument that won the day
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,655	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Who is this
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They're going to do it with this agency called Lotus which
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To their understanding
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Paid the surrogates
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	$12,000
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I mean service racks
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	8 in Indian rupees would that be the dollar equivalent
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	$12,000 now
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For a rural women in India
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That is a massive sum of money
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They figured this one just helped her survive it will change her life
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She'll be changing their life
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And they'll be changing hers
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Maybe this was
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Kind of like Alfred
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They get money

EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And dates nuts
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Today

EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Crazy day

EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,335	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I was shocked
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,199	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Gilly was
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So tiny Gilly was 3.8 lb
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	His brother Duvall 4.8
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Enzyme

EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Cat
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To touch
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	He says he expected the twins to stay in the hospital for a month
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,959	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But the nurses
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We're like
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I thought I don't have enough time to think cuz I understand tomorrow I need to take them home and to be alone
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And I never
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Take care of
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Beanie Babies
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	IAC
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I said to the nurses
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,183	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Teach me how to feed them
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And after 3 days I took them home
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,887	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So where was the
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Surrogate during these days when she at the hospital I think she was in.
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because she had the
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A cesarean
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Surgery I was asked
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	If she's okay if she needs something
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They said you cannot see air
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Until she signed all the papers
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,855	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You can see her
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The papers have been signed because she's giving up all her
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Paternal rights and if she doesn't want to sign on
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This paper but we can lose the baby
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Crazily complicated but basically they needed Israel India and Nepal
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To all recognize that they were the uncontested
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Hanging in the air
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	As a recent case in Thailand
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	After baby is born
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Changed her mind
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Lake and his Husband believe the surrogate decided to try and keep the baby
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,071	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because she found out they were gay
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We had a little bit of anxiety let's say they will
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Going to know
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But the baby is going to grow
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In the house with two dads
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Unicase tall is in the Paul with the twins
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Amir is back in Tel Aviv
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Couple weeks go by and then
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tyler called me and said that my dad the second circuit
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,647	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	1 baby
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And day after
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Dual Istanbul
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Plane from symbol
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then it was very very very nice that we went
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Play with the babies would like no parents no friends no phone on falling
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Snow world to visit first
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Block Survivor
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Relationship with the babies
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For the next month they lived in an apartment in Nepal
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Just them and their three babies
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Learning to be dads
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Waiting for the paperwork to be done
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Now the paperwork incidentally is a beast
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because after the surrogate sign away their rights
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Babies have no nationality
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Then there's suddenly illegal in the country
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The guys have to
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,840	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Take a DNA test send it to Israel
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Verify then they got to get a passport for the baby's then several sets of visas need to
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Begotten
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A doll that means
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Multiple trips
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To the Israeli m
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:37,152	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And it was on one of those trips
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Did they learn
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It was really weird because we went over there with our
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,808	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Kids together Park
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And over there
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	There was another ceragon from a different agency
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	An Indian woman and standing next to her was an Israeli woman who happened to speak Hindi and we just so you know
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Curiosity we
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,144	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Ask her to ask
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The surrogate in Hindu
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,056	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How much is she's getting
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For the whole process
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:12,480	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But the service was very shyness not very delighted to speak about the money
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Which made them even more Curious so they persist
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,344	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then we discovered that
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She gets only 3000 to your soul or something like that
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	$3,000 for the whole pregnancy was like
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:36,544	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	$12,500 supposed to go to the surrogate that was at least as understanding
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:42,944	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This was a different woman from a different agency in this was just one woman's account but still
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In your narrative you describe that you thought that the reason that this was
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Okay
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:50,880	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Need to do the surrogacy is
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because you were afraid uses this would make a
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:57,536	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Changing the life of the woman that was a life-changing sum of money
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:02,656	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Timaeus as they walked away from that meeting wondering if they should do something in Israel
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Call the agency at the very least say hey we heard some rumors I'm sure they're not true but what do you
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We started to ask question but then
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Literally the next day
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Orinda scenes of death and destruction from Nepal today after a powerful earthquake that started outside plug mongoose
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The death toll is now over 5,800 nearly fourteen thousand were injured
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:41,568	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Officials say it is the most destructive earthquake to hit Nepal
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:47,968	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In more than 80 year
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	My said she was in New York in a meeting and she gets his voice mail from tile
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Shouting an earthquake that happened
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:07,168	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And here we save the babies and we got down to the street where half-naked we don't know what to do and he's cry
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Crying over there and then
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Suddenly
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Stop
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The heroes
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The connection
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It was
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Like 12 hours with no connection to them
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We didn't know if they're alive or not
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You know everything was
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Unknown I don't know how but that'll
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Buche cell phone and we just ran Barefoot as they ran out of the apartment down the street half name
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,960	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Naked holding the babies
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And the phone

EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Hadn't really been grass
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:45,376	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Go this whole thing has been going on kind of quietly now you have an international earthquake
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Everybody's watching the television and in the middle of the story they're like 10 Israeli babies and gay people and
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:56,384	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How many
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,176	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	24
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Whoa cuz there is another agency that also
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Babies
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yes
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Moving from Nepal to Israel
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:19,936	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Maya says when the images of those 24 babies Splash docker
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:26,080	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Cross Israeli TV screens
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In these ready media search way she broke out one side of the argument was okay we are
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Using women and it's 6 on Morrell in from the other hand there was like okay nice ready for
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Are gay couples they don't have a lot of choices
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:44,512	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Evan was asking what do we do with all these babies
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And a surrogate's there was like a huge argument in the Israeli media
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	About the questions of there are women that are waiting to to give birth and we need to bring them to Israel
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Give birth here cause the father is are here
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:04,992	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So they would fly the women to Israel have the baby and then slide them back
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But I do know I think that's legally
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,320	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They could not do that
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because that just it feels like kidnapping a lady
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And so it went what happened was it very quickly Israel sent over
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Search and rescue and Medical Aid delegation
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And all the babies
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:24,960	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And their parents they were basically just all put on a plane
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Instead of the process was expedited and they just brought everybody over to Israel
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,664	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Back in Israel a parade of newborns
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It will celebrate together
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:37,248	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Knowing the medical stress they've been through
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Very much aware that many in Nepal
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Are still going through it
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So what happened to the surrogates
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Any idea they check
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	With the agency what is the situation with the surrogate mothers and the answer was that
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,608	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Two of them are Becky Mindy already
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And they weren't there
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,424	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	India earthquake
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:58,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And what about all the circuits were in the Paul but hadn't given birth yet
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah I mean about them there's a big question I mean
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	No one knows
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:06,944	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They were like a worried fathers in Israel
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:11,296	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	All my thoughts and my prayers are for the surrogate mother and
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,576	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For The Unborn Child
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,112	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tell him you made it
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Backed Israel with their babies
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Define but
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	There is still a lot of
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:20,256	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Have you guys
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,816	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I would still be wondering after all
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:26,912	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	These both of these women gave you as you point out a remarkable gift
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Both of you believe that
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:30,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You hope
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Both of you hope that
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That gift was well rewarded
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Was life changing
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But both of you don't know
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	At this point
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,504	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Just a little suspicious that maybe it wasn't
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,576	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I don't know you have this funny feeling you need to
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Find out whether they got paid what you
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Thought you'd paid them yes like this is why we're so glad that we made the connection with you guys
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I said we heard that you can
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Finding Maybe
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,752	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We started
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,776	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Kind of a whole new Legos
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,848	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Hello can you hear me
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Oh I hear some other things too actually it might just be static on the line but it kind of sound
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The ocean
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Switch off the fan
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:17,344	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Give me a sec
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A producer Molly Webster was able to track down a reporter and Indian the luncheon of bomac
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,512	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And she asked her if she could
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Find a surrogate
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:31,168	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's okay so you're giving me a name right
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,728	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I actually called that person in Nepal
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:40,640	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Location of the clinic doctor and she said that yes I will
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,688	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Touch with one of the surrogate
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:45,760	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And the next morning we supposed to touch base again
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,320	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But then again she just totally went in communicating
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:53,696	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That's been the same day I open my mail and there was a mail from Israeli no Adam asking me like
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:56,512	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Just like to stop the search for some time
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah I was so near them
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:05,472	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	As far as we understand what happened was it the doctor contacted lotus lotus contact to tell in a mirror saying
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Call off the reporters you're putting these women's lives in danger
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Someone in their Village sees a reporter hanging around
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They'll know those women were surrogates that's not something you circuits want people to know
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Stop
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:23,136	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Here's up here's my understanding you guys correct me if I'm wrong is that we we had asked someone to looked for them
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:26,720	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And that person got kind of clothes and then word got back to the agency
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And that's great some pressure
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Foresta changing
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You know that's really what we started staring at right now
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,168	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How to respond
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:37,472	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We heard that there was a real threat
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Are there live
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:41,312	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because of the culture of the society that they live in
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	One of them was Muslim
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:43,872	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I don't know if
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:46,944	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is the Muslim societies going to accept
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:48,992	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The fact that she
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Carry the pregnancy to a gay couple
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:53,600	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And to swell
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And two Israelis
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That's a very
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:58,976	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Very
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Weird fairy
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Delicate
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Situation
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,352	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We don't want anything that
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Met her
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The surrogate well I mean we want to tell the story
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We definitely don't want anyone to get
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:15,872	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But I do feel like we have an ethical obligation to hear from the women who do this
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	If not V specific women in this case then
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	People who represent lyrics
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:22,528	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Create candy bar
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It would be it would feel wrong for that to be a voice that we don't
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I don't know out
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's like
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's for us it's it's a we don't want that anybody will contact our surrogate
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:40,192	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And if it says that it's not going to be without the story so let's do it because
EDL	00:32:40,192	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's not worth it for us

EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:34,272	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Cuz we've been concentrating the tail so far on the father's been with 20

EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Baby so what could they be thinking what is the
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,976	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Story about them how are they feeling about this
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Transaction
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How much are they getting it will it actually change their life
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,400	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	These are some of the questions we had we gave those questions to Molly
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And she should have ran with
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,984	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In the months after the earthquake
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I guess you get to the
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,336	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The political situation in Nepal
EDL	00:35:58,336	00:36:01,408	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Change how everyone started looking at surrogacy change
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:02,944	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Once everyone saw these
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Pictures of all these babies outside the Israeli Embassy being put on airplanes
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Sent back to Israel it just
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:14,208	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Cracked open his huge debate not just back in Israel but in Nepal and India even internationally
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,768	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Basically you had groups coming out and saying like
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:23,168	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You know the feminists were saying this is exploitation and we're just using these women for their wombs and their op-ed articles about should we be
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:27,008	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Be shifting women across borders is it the way you want to do surrogacy
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:30,080	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Turn of the next thing that happens
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Three weeks after we talked to Thailand mirror
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is that Nepal actually
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Decided to ban circus
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:38,528	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Completely
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Completely Straits for both same-sex couples foreign couples local couples and for 4
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Nepali women couldn't do it and Indian women tend to come into their borders and do it
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,304	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	No more surrogacy no more loophole
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:54,400	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	No more surrogacy normal pulse but then the confusion was that
EDL	00:36:54,400	00:36:59,264	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They banned surrogacy but there were still a pregnant surrogates on the ground
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:02,336	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And so they sort of existed in this
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,872	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Gray Zone
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And in the midst of that was when we went out to try and find surrogate
EDL	00:37:11,040	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In Nepal all the circuits are kept in what are called shelter houses which are just like
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:22,048	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Houses that agencies rent out that have a lot of pregnant women
EDL	00:37:22,048	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Houses like the rumors are that they move the houses
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,912	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Further away from the city center
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:28,448	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Attract less attention
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:34,848	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And so what we found Nepali reporter
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This beast in Kathmandu article trying to get into one of the shelter houses
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:40,736	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The shelter house is actually quite far from the main city center
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Almost half an hour 40 minutes drive from Kathmandu
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:54,816	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's all on a Hilltop because these are the outskirts of Kathmandu where new settlement of just started
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:37:59,680	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It was actually a
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,704	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	School building
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:05,824	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Which they turned into a shelter because I think the school are left after the earthquake
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The moment I reached the first floor I was so surprised it was very noisy a lot of children playing around
EDL	00:38:16,576	00:38:21,184	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And turns out a lot of women bringing the young children if they're too young to be left alone
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Really yeah and how many women were there
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:26,048	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Still around I think 20 or 22 women.
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	20 or 22 women on the first floor of this building
EDL	00:38:30,400	00:38:36,800	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This shelter house is run by another Israeli agency so not Lotus but a different one and we're guessing that
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Most of the women were carrying babies for Israeli cup
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And it is the women I saw who outside the room or who had their doors open
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:48,064	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They seem to be around 32 early 40s
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:51,904	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Really the first time I saw I saw the first woman I talked to him
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,952	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Arguing
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She was wearing like a mustard color
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,048	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Sorry
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She had some Bangles all the women had some Bangles in the hands and Mitchell
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:07,008	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She said she was 36 years old
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:07,520	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Megabox
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	From Kolkata
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Bolivia
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She has two girls
EDL	00:39:16,480	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Berkeley asked how old are your girls
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She said 8 and 12 so
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,600	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How did you get the number
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:25,184	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Never could you ask like why are you doing this
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And the woman said
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I'm doing it for them it's because you know we have a lot of
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,656	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Financial problem my husband deserve
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Rickshaw driver and we don't make enough and

EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And ultimately she said she had no other way
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:47,712	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To raise money for her daughter
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To get married because
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	In Hindu weddings
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:58,208	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The bride's family pays off the groom in the form of a dowry the plan was to use the money from surrogacy
EDL	00:39:58,208	00:39:58,720	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	For the day
EDL	00:40:01,280	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She's been in Kathmandu for 3 months
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,608	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So she was in her first trimester

EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But you knows it's not her
EDL	00:40:24,320	00:40:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And actually all the women that prakruti talk to her very very clear about this
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:30,464	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Cesar Millan
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This is a job

EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:52,224	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And she put the job sentiment pretty plainly
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So she said and I'm translating here

EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	If a baby comes out right now I just give it right away and then she laughed
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Did you get a sense that these women didn't want it
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:41,120	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Known that they were doing this
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:44,192	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I mean some of them did and some of them didn't
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:51,360	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Because some women would like to go but now that I'm here my neighbor's my family everyone
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And then when Mercury Aster
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:41:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I have an opinion is it right or wrong
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She answered
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	No I'm here for the money
EDL	00:42:06,207	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I would not listen to any opinion
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	If it was wrong I would not come here
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But some of them was like why would I tell anyone you know there's one Temecula
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	32 years old Beijing nail polish on and she had lettuce pink lips
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Stick on wallet
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She said people in my Village simply do not believe these things this week
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The one can have children by getting injected or taking medicine
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,415	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They won't believe this
EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She kind of do badan us with
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	How some of the people in a village
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I done something similar when they
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Bred cows or fishes
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,679	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You said like maybe they'll understand
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:49,727	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But my family would not understand
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She says nude williger
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I have told lies to them
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So how much in the end of it do they make
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I asked him how much money do you get here
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:14,047	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	3.5 lakhs
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	What is that mean in dollars
EDL	00:43:17,119	00:43:19,423	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So if you do the conversion today
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:22,495	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's 5300 US dollars
EDL	00:43:22,495	00:43:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And the way it works is that they get paid a small amount of money every month that they're pregnant and then at the end they get a lump sum
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:34,527	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Prakruti said that for these women at the end of the pregnancy that lump sum is like let's say around
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	What's $3,000
EDL	00:43:36,319	00:43:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Which is the amount that telling me or heard outside the embassy
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:41,951	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The total sum that they have when they go back home is quiet
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You know it's not
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,487	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A lot
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:46,047	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So $5,000 is
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah what's the difference
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tutor to see if this was a number that was just coming out of that shelter house or if it was something that was
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,823	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Like the going rate I guess
EDL	00:43:58,591	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We talked to
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Sixer gets here in India
EDL	00:44:01,663	00:44:08,063	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That same rate around $5,000 kept coming up and we did hear a range from one surrogate in this was about
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A friend of hers
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We heard as low as 1000
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A surrogate getting only $1,000 for pregnancy
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yeah
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Hello
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Jerusalem calling
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:29,567	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	New York answering
EDL	00:44:29,567	00:44:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Ultimately we took this information back to telling a mirror because
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:34,175	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This was originally there question
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So let's talk about the money partner
EDL	00:44:37,759	00:44:39,039	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Alright so
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The last time we talked to you
EDL	00:44:40,831	00:44:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Thought you're paying your surrogates $12,000
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:46,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Yes I around if
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We've been off reporting and it seems like the number that's coming up most consistently for what surrogates are reporting
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	As their rate 5300 US dollars
EDL	00:44:57,727	00:44:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	What
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's just too much
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tulo
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:16,671	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Really yeah
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:17,695	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I want to cry
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We explain to them that if you actually look at the contract the line that looks like it's
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Payment Straight Talk
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Do the surrogate doesn't actually say this is
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,215	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Payment for the surrogate
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It says it says payment to surrogacy
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Services
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:34,335	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And it's sort of like once you
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:36,895	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Adding that second word
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It opens the door to all kinds of things
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,991	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She's getting less than 1/2
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:44,575	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Then it's like
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:45,599	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Felix tacos
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:48,415	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's okay to get the money
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	So who got the money
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That question it hung in the air for a few weeks
EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Until
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:04,543	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	7 minutes before I go into something
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:08,639	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Who is the head of lotus which is the agency that town Amir used in Nepal
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:09,663	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She had just
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	At the morning I talked to her she had just flown in from Nepal to Israel and I caught her in a car on our way back to the
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,855	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Where in she's going to fly off to Australia
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	After how much do surrogates actually get paid
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:24,511	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I can tell you through that I work in India
EDL	00:46:24,511	00:46:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	2010
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:28,607	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Tell you exactly

EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:40,127	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She saying she has no idea and the reason she has no idea
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is because
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	She said this and other agencies I spoke to said this is that when you're working on the ground in foreign countries
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Under the Umbrella of surrogacy
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:55,743	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	You are dealing with a lot of middlemen and the Middleman have middlemen and there are submental men
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:47:02,143	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The people who find women in India who get all the paperwork done who get them to the Border who get them over the Border
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Then bring them to jump all
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:05,727	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Someone be sending catmandoo gets into the shelter house
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And all those people
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	They need to get paid
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I truly don't know
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	After the agency know how much
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:24,927	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Exactly how much goes for her competition for her
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:28,255	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I can tell you I was thinking about
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:29,791	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I would feel conflicted
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:32,351	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	As the head of an agency to be like
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I think the money is going to some people that I just don't know like
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I think I would niggle at me
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:46,431	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Well that's a good thing that you're doing what you're doing
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:47,711	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Let me know

EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:57,439	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I cannot deal with all the problems in the world
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	To give him as much
EDL	00:47:58,207	00:47:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	As possible
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:02,047	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	We paid the money
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	4
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:05,887	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	This woman gets
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Life
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And now we understand it
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Not exactly like that
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	It's not right
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I think we're deep question here underneath after everything is
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is over
EDL	00:48:20,735	00:48:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	When
EDL	00:48:23,551	00:48:27,903	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	When we do a generous thing like we give people families who couldn't have families
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:30,463	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	But that becomes a business
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:32,767	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is there something about
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:36,095	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The business of making a family
EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	That
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:39,935	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Is always going to be a little trouble
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:43,263	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	And there are no perfect ways to do this
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:44,287	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Or is there
EDL	00:48:44,799	00:48:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	A way to pull this off in some
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:48,895	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I just don't know
EDL	00:48:49,919	00:48:50,687	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	I mean like

EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Do the process may be in the states
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The US is like an entirely different
EDL	00:49:10,399	00:49:12,959	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Surrogacy seen which were just not going to get into here
EDL	00:49:12,959	00:49:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	The interesting thing that that Donna said and head of another agency
EDL	00:49:18,847	00:49:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18birthstory |	Was that they think that in the next like 5 to 10 years the US will be one of the only countries where surrogacy is still happening
