EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Centinela Park
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	To report
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,624	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	On the eastern and Northern front
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So the war

EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:18,144	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The agony of the Nazi bombardment of that City and its from there
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In Menlo Park
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,496	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So this
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	1
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Day
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This wasn't in the winter
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Malaparte was posted with a Finnish Army who were fighting along with the Nazis
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And they were perched just north of vinegar
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,040	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	On the shores of Lake ladoga which is this big
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Lake
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	About in the city
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And on this day
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The Nazis bombarded.
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The start of the forest fire everyone ran for cover
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Soldiers ran Every Witch Way and in the middle of the forest there were Soviet forces that were locked up in a stable
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:02,176	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And the horses
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And broke out at the Stables hundreds of them and they just started running to get away from the
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:14,976	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Do you have hundreds of horses vaulting through this flaming Forest heading towards the open space I had
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Which was the lake once they first out of the forest and go barreling into Lake
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Stampeding one on top of the other
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:29,567	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	If y'all get deeper and deeper
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In the blink of an eye
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Snap some shots
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It just freezes
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:40,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Suddenly turns to ice with a bang
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It goes from water to ice with this violence
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Snap
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And suddenly the horses are in 2
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Malaparte right cities in the waves on the Lake Weir gripped in midair and sort of suspend
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Fade Out
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The next morning when malaparte in the fins
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Woke up and discovered the forest fire had burned itself out
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And look at that the lake has frozen solid overnight
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And his finished friends said yes that's sometimes
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They look and see what are those bumps on the ice over there
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They go to investigate and they find themselves in this
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Horrific sculpture garden of
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Horses heads
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Sticking up out of the solid marble like
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	4 of ice
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	He said hundreds of hundreds of Horseheads leaderboard

EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Region of the world during that winter and every so often he and the other soldiers
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Go and have a smoke

EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,783	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Doctor's review sites
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Floors of argument
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We ended up going uptown to Rockefeller University
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:57,279	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Medical people who know about I so we're going to go play with some super cool ice
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Magnum
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This fellow

EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They occasionally almost show up and I almost meet them but I never have yeah
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	By the way the Sackler family
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,711	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Recently come into a bit of controversy
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We all know that now
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We didn't it
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Daleks you must be said isn't amazing dude
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Graciously agreed to demonstrate that you can in fact
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Create the conditions of that massive Lake
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Inside a tiny little stupid
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,983	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Destructive Falcon Falcon tube
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The plastic tube filled with water
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This is not normal water this is the really nice water it's very very
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:49,247	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Pure water no minerals no Destiny like super distilled and he says when you take water like that and you cool it down
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	You can get it far below its freezing point and it won't freeze
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Unless that is
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Yeah but
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	You have a tiny horse here
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We have a tiny
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And we are going to drop that into the Falcon tube and do that
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:06,911	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's going to be awesome so we handed us
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The tube I'm holding a little vial of supercooled water with it Alex what temperature do you think
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,359	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This is mine this is mine
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	C Celsius
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	When does water freezes at 0
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	20 degrees below freezing point at Stillwater but not for long
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Unscrewed the cap are you are you filming
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We held the little plastic horse over the tube
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,231	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Count down or something
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Okay on the count of three guilty
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	At 3
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,863	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	2 1
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:51,455	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Because the moment that little plastic horse hit the water the water slammed into ice
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Selling that little guy was trapped
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In a nice guy
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Oh my God is Thor's is Frozen
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Please remember the horse was plastic no animals were harmed in this experiment
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It is honestly breathtaking
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,887	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	But it happens
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Selfie
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,447	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Catastrophic ice formation
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Just like that
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	You're the seaward Robert say it again
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Catastrophic
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This is Virginia Walker
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Andaman the department of biology Queens University
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Virginia was one of the many people that we called up to
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	To ask
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	What the hell like why does this happen
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Action this water just freeze gradually the way that
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Water does you know what 32 degrees Fahrenheit
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Whatever new
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So you see this
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's why we have to stop at the beginning as Julie Andrews said
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	A very good place
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Start right
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	All right
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:46,239	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So the only reason that water freezes normally at zero
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Celsius
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	32 Fahrenheit
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Is that the something they have that makes
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Freeze we Colette and UK later
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Sounds like a superhero
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Yeah I'm alright
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,783	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Citizen ukulele
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	A nucleator is like
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Accede
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Right
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Didn't know this but it turns out
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Water almost always needs a seed
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In order to grow ice
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It turns out water by itself is not actually
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That good at remembering how to become ice
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That is Erin Pettit
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	She's a glaciologist
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:24,383	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	At the University of Alaska Fairbanks and which of these is it when water cools down the molecule start to slow their movement
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	A little bit closer together that point they want all hold hands and become I set the water molecules don't quite remember
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Very well
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,599	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	How they're supposed to be organized
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Bill equate do you stand here and I stand here how do we do this again
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They need to be shown what combination of angles work the best to create a nice day
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,095	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Table
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Structure what they need is a speck of dust that's the nucleus
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	He throwing some dust and to otherwise pure water now they have a guy
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Because I scan start to mimic whatever the the the shape of the Dust particle is
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	What happens if the water molecule start to form a cage around the dust particle in that case shape
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,575	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Is very similar to the shape they need
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	To make ice
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,927	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Something that I like that's how we do it
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,279	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Sooner sense the dust particle is reminding the water molecules
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	How to freeze
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	No I do
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Think of it like that
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Bridget says it's actually not quite so
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So gentle really what's happening is the dust particle is
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,591	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Forcing the water molecules into the right shape around it
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It's like a it's like a command
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,431	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Nothing about memory is its
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It's a physical thing
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They just got jammed in there
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Started
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Dog ate so if
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	As we just learned water needs
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The catalyst nucleator
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In order to
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,351	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Fries
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,935	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Doesn't least raise the possibility that that
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Finnish Russian Lake
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And reached
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:55,775	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Supercooled state
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Along come these horses and they
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Where the nucleator maybe they had dust on their hair
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Or whatever I don't know
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,199	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Whatever it was it started a chain reaction
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Ice
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Spread outward from these horses shot across the entire leg
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,599	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And froze the whole damn thing
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Once
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,887	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	An actual excuse me for just a second because this is like at reading like in post I have
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We're going to take a break and we'll continue this

EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And I request for those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Williams
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:16,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I did something
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:19,999	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	How do they do that
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:26,143	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:32,799	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Specific moments where
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Kid does something super smart but doesn't have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	If you have a story

EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Okay so big Jad Robert Radiolab before the break
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We posited what I thought was an interesting Theory robber
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Not buying it now get to your skepticism I want to talk
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	A little bit more
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	About nucleator
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Because when we were talking with Virginia
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,607	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Tell us something kind of cool
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Astrolabe
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	What else
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:32,959	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Nucleotide
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We learn about Josh but what else can do
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,775	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Okay
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:38,079	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The best nucleator
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:38,847	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Is ice
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:42,943	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So just have a little bit of snow falls into some water or a little bit ice
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Forms in the water organically
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:48,575	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The water molecules will rush around that and Bam if you don't have ice
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	What is the second best thing
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Tenor ukulele size
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Happens to be bacteria
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	She says there aren't
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,351	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Three different kinds of bacteria
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They can generate these
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:05,727	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Special protein big hunk and protein that can instantly turn water into ice
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In fact we were reporting the story of video started circulating on the internet
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It showed a scientist taking a bottle of water squirting out a little bit of this bacteria in a minute
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Nothing just shot in dice
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And that
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Cool thing is
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	These bacteria are actually Plum pathogen
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Plant killer
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So you've probably seen bras
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Growing in your backyard or whatever and it can be all covered with frost
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	But then you know the frosting melt and it's still green
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	But if those bacteria present
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	She says they'll spit out their proteins
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Under the plant
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,519	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Generate seed ice crystals
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,311	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Ice crystals
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Then slice the plan open and
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:47,711	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Expose the inside of the plant at the bacteria site yummy
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	His lunch and the eat the eat the inside of the
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Good strategy
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's not the cool part
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Regina said she is also found these proteins
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Bacteria that don't
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:00,255	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So that made me think
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,279	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Mater wonder why
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,559	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Why would they need to me
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And that's when it
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,631	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It occurred to her and a few other
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,191	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Maybe it's about
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Transportation
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Exactly where
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Nothing about these bacteria just sitting on these play
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,895	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And what happens is the wind comes along
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:22,015	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Blues up this little bacteria into the upper atmosphere
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Blows them literally up into the cloud
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Did not particularly cold hardy
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,391	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Situation
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Do you not want to be all the way up there
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They got to get back down to the Earth
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:36,095	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And unless I hit you right on those horses that you keep talking about
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	This a light
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,911	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They might not come down to us
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So what day do Shih Tzus back since they use the plant trick they spit out these proteins
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:49,407	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Into the cold wet Cloud which galvanizes the water molecules around them
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The Forum
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Snowflake
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Around their body
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So now they got this little hovercraft
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	They can use to
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:01,951	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Post on down
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:07,071	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	With they make ice they can get back down and they can get back down into different place
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And start a new colony of bacteria somewhere else
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:13,983	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And so but this way they get dispersed around the whole us
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Think about that
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The next time it's winter
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,335	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It snows
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Apparently
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,895	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	If you melt
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Each snowflake
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	You'll find a little bacterium inside
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,063	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	You're saying all of them
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	I haven't looked at
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Every single
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Snowflake
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	But it makes perfect sense doesn't it
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's a bit that's a very very cool idea
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	I suddenly like the bacteria movie
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Helluva lot better
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:39,839	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The horse movie
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Solis
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	At least as a shot of being true
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The horses
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So when we were reporting this story.
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Darren Pettit in Virginia walker and a bunch of other
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	We asked
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,575	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Could entire leg
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Flash frozen in an instant
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Trappin all those horses
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Uniformly the answer that we got was no
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Did you hear her know there did you hear the sound of it
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Can you say absolutely not or is it just a kind of gentle no
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,567	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	I'd say that's an absolutely not
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Because Aaron told this when you're talking about freezing and it's
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,407	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Prior Lake
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Will you got a lot of problems to consider first
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Process of
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Freezing
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Actually is a source of heat
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Itself because like when water molecules form bonds to make ice
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's a lot of activity
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The inactivity producer
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Energy and now
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That's going to make things a little bit warmer not to mention the fact that horses are warm-blooded animals
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	But they also would slow down the process
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Also the water would never have been pure enough to super glue in the first place because I
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	There's too many things in the lake that would
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:19:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Provide that initial nucleation plants organisms dirt
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Did somebody actually see this what is the actual evidence that
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	No
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,951	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Nobody saw any of this as it actually happened
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,999	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	When we told Walter Marsh with the scientist
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	In typical Baltimore fashion he was
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,375	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Iseecars
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Reminded us that he never told us it was true that malaparte often mixed fact in
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Addiction and a theory real reason he's attracted
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:25,823	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	The story
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Because it offered a metaphor for cosmology the beginning of the universe
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Really
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	I mean
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	If you'll excuse me for a small bit of skepticism is true for the universe metaphor metaphor
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Even so you mean here's what I mean
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:51,679	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And if you're a physicist listening right now just turn off
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	So you can think of it in one of two ways right the first is that idea of super Cooling
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Wechat Rockefeller where
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:03,711	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Under the right circumstances water can cool down way below its freezing point
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Not freeze
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And then all of a sudden
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Innokin suddenly do that
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	What you thought Rockefeller in the test
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	According to Jan 11
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Professor of physics

EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And therefore holds because
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	That Bizarro flash freezing phenomenon actually happen repeatedly
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,823	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	She says in the moments after the big bang
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,591	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Yes
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Supercooling is definitely something that happens in the early yunnan
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	She says right when the universe got its start
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Still small like a size of a grapefruit
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Inside the grapefruit is extremely hot back then it was probably a million billion trillion
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Million times hotter
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	A million trillion trillion trillion times 32 times hotter
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Bedazzled grapefruit began to expand the temperature started to drop and it dropped and dropped to a point where

EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	To speak but it didn't
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	It's waiting is waiting for you and you're like what's happening why aren't you freezing then suddenly

EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:22,048	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	There's another parallel which I think is actually even more
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Has to do with those seeds
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,632	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Do we talked about

EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	Like maybe were here is a little bit more matter and heat than over there
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:03,264	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	And bees rrc
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast17supercool |	I don't think that you're describing seed like I understand see Caesar Little Things
