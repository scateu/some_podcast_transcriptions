EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I use the middle initial L for Lewis and honor of my father who asked a question
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:15,647	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A simple question maybe a dangerous question just the beer asking
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A vacuum at ruin the man's life never got answered but today on Radiolab we are going to re-ask Harold's question
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This time

EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And let it Master takes it from here so our main guy Herald
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He's former military and he's 81 years old
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Staying pretty active I'm competing at the national and World level or do a salon compass
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Location
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Right off the bat this is the kind of guy you could tell he just does not give up
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:51,999	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I've really I'm not supposed to be competing because I've had both knees replaced but anyway
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	When is Tiny Town Called Brown's Illinois from up where family is the eldest of 11 kids
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Planes going up
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He would always here
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:07,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Air Force planes flying overhead and that's why I from when he was very young he always wanted to be an
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Air Force pilot
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	How do you spell a little bit about your military background
---	00:06:11,967	00:06:17,087	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Well most of my career was with the air rescue service
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This is in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war if an Airforce pilot went down got shot down
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Whatever Carol Dennison would jump into their helicopters kudroli green heavy lift helicopters
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:36,031	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hover over the survivors on the ground lowering the voice cable and their pararescuemen climb down
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:42,431	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	On the fourth floor find the injured Soldier and attached to cables
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hold the helicopter steady you had to hold his hover and a lot of time
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:54,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The enemy would wait until that process started before they open fire
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I've had some wonderful experiences that probably Chief among them with my crew and I
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We picked up a pilot ejected in the North Sea at night in the winter time
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,407	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hundred miles out to see if we picked him up and
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,967	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Brought him back
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:20,319	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Super high-risk high-adrenaline kind of job and I hadn't
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Outstanding record
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And then well well he got
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Old how old were you around this time
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,303	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Bye-bye by 39 old
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:38,495	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Pilot to my age and with my experience were put into desk jobs
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Wanted to be on the front line if I could
---	00:07:43,871	00:07:47,199	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This was 1973 middle of the Cold War
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:53,599	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Harold decided that the way for him to be on the front lines without actually having to be on the front lines you know cuz
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,623	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Couldn't anymore
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	With to go into training to become a missileer
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Missile launch officer those are the people who sit in a underground bunker and
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Just wait to get an order to turn the turkey
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And unleash a nuclear attack in trading Hemmings just the information
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:17,151	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Remember just virtually Brooke verbatim
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Bears that eat
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,479	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Methodological offer
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:26,879	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Has under his Direct Control more Firepower than
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Can all Generals in all wars in the history of warfare
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And so
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Started his training at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Nixon was president
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:53,503	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At the time and at the time the prospect of nuclear war
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Felt very real
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And a lot of responsibility there and there's no room for error
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Until in Harold's training we were very small class he learned all about the technical stuff you know all them
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Mechanical stuff and emergency procedures that were involved all the nitty-gritty details of our missile actually
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:17,823	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You want Shannon part of time we had classroom instruction where he learned about the chain of command and all the difference
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Safeguards in check so I imagine that he gets an order to Launch
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That order has to be decoded so he would decode the order and then his partner with the order and it would verify it with one another
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	One guy would be like okay I got the order alpha bravo 1 to 4
---	00:09:33,439	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I confirm Alpha bravo 1 to 4 and then they launched
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So neither of them
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Has the power to launch on his or her own and
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Both of you are and do you carry a sidearm with you
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,127	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Why
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Well you know it's serious business if you had someone that was
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:10:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You know if if they threaten your life if one of the officers wanted to just go Rogue you had a sidearm
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I took my gun and pointed against return the key Harlow I may go down but I
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:13,119	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Be drawn my weapon at least keep have to be turned simultaneously so if I shoot you
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Turn my key then Rover get your key and turn your key is too late right after you simultaneously
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:23,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To the whole point is the system is designed so that no one person
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Can launch a nuclear attack
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I was very pleased very satisfied with a checks and balances that the crew member levels the bottom worth
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They're turning the keys I was not concerned about that at all
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But then a few weeks into training there was a
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Some discussion about
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:41,535	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Preemptive strike
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Real quick
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:51,055	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Obviously if someone launched a nuclear attack against the us we would be able to strike back
---	00:10:51,823	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Their pre-emptive strike would be where we for whatever reason Decided to strike First
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And that raise the hair on the back of my neck a little bit you know I just
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I thought we're receiving all of this information about all these elaborate checks and balances
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Within the system but they never got any information about how things worked at the presidential level
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	There's a complete void or blackout at the level that the order is in
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,431	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Initiated
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	When you had this thought that you say to the other classmates it wasn't my intent to try to create
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Racine by involving other people students whatever so Harold weeks until the end of class
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:48,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What's up with the front of the room and asks the instructor
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:54,495	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A question the very reasonable question he's like just checking up there's a safety net in place at the present
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:58,079	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is making a crazy decision right I want her to find out more
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	About checks and balances at the
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A top-level instructor pauses
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Looks at him
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Can you put that in writing please
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,159	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Okay and so he did let me find it first
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,559	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You do your best to have everything ready to go
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Oh here it is
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Okay
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:27,519	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	There is presently a degree of doubt my mind as to whether I might someday be called upon the lawn
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nuclear weapons as a result of an invalid unlawful order is it part of the letter that Harold wrote explaining his
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Question I ask myself
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	How Will I Know
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Or can I be sure
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm I am participating in a justifiable act if you were ordered to turn his keys
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He would absolutely do so
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Because you're not being told what the checks and balances are for the president
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He would be doing so
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	With a conflict of conscience
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Picture of underline
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I would be required to assign Blind Faith values to my judgment of one man
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The present
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,991	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Values which could ultimately include
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hello
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Personality
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And political considerations
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This just should not be
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Okay there's a lot of
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Sex on me but who is checking the president
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,847	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Kind of serious question
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Because right now we have a president President Trump
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,199	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Google
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is clearly interested in nuclear weapons
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He talks about it constantly you got the thing with North Korea escalating tensions of North Korea Syria for chrissakes
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Student makes you stop and think like
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:53,535	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Okay if and when these decisions get made how are they made
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is there someone else in the room
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:02,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If the president is determine if he if he's ready to go is there somebody there and turn to the president
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That is a great question
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This is historian Alex wellerstein he's the one who introduces Harold he wrote an article in the Washington Post
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:20,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Post about this very topic am I at the right place I want to be just like a fists length away
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yeah yeah he has spent
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:30,143	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So much time in the archives behind microfilm readers and foiling documents and doing all kinds
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Different things
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To figure out the history of our relationship to this
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Uniquely destructive weapon and what he found was a kind of tug of war
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Between the military and the president
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,503	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That is gone.
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	More than 70 years
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Good morning by President Roosevelt's death
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Harry S Truman becomes president
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:58,815	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Woman learned how to bomb the day that Roosevelt died
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:05,215	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This is April 1945 at this point America has been at war with Japan for over 3 years
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It was impressed upon Truman that this was
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:13,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Not just another weapon that this was something that could be bigger and better than any other weapon before
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But there's no
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Point with somebody says
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,807	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hey mr. president sure we bomb Japan with this bump
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Assumed
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,391	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Of course you're going to do it you have the bomb
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:29,791	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You have the enemy and in fact nobody ever goes to Truman and says should we do this they go
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Go to Hammond they say we are doing this
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The Truman write in his journal
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We're going to use the atomic bomb but we will not use it on a civilian Target we will use it on a purely military Target
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That's the term
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,591	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Shirley
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Shirley
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:49,759	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That we can't get into his head to know exactly what I was thinking but that is what he wrote in his journal at the time and then he says we will not be
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,271	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Killing women and chill
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The first atomic bomb
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is going to be dropped by a President
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Thinks he's dropping it on soldiers only he's
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Someone congratulating himself on the no women and children will be killed in this attack
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:18,687	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Men's announcement after they dropped the bomb the day after they get casualty estimates from the Japanese and he realizes
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This is not purely a military base
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Approximately the size of Memphis or Seattle or Rochester New York no longer exist
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:35,071	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The total death toll was almost 200 thousand
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So there's a real switch that happens between Truman talking about the bomb and also everything he says about the bomb before he hears with a k
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:47,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Casualties on both the greatest thing ever and this is the greatest day in history and he's so proud and so happy and then here's
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	About the casualties in tears about the women and children and suddenly it becomes a burden
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Now what happen
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Japan August 10th he gets a message from General Groves
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Just three days after Hiroshima dropped two bombs
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,487	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Alberta have a third one in a week
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Just FYI
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And it's not clear
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The Truman new the two bombs are going to be drop so soon
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He is
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,727	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Just learn the Hiroshima is a city
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	When he just wanted another city
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He is not in control
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And he has immediately written back
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To that massage
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Stop knock it off
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:27,807	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You are not going to drop another bomb without express permission of the president of the United States
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Soak the major theme of Truman's approach to nuclear weapons
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,951	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If they keep them out of the hands of the millet
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Why he believes that the military if you give them a new weapon they will use it
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It's not a crazy idea to design and build these bombs to make sure the military can't launch them on
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The nuclear parts of the bomb have to be in the possession of the civilians the Nuclear So the
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:18:00,063	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The plutonium the plutonium core nearly bombs allowed to do that the fronts of them actually open up and allow you to stick
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Krikorian and close it back up so the civilians walk into the room with the explosive part the soldiers open
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Lid
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:14,911	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The civilians put the explosive part in close the door now you have an active Bomb by putting a battery or something else
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Biking to your Walkman why do I have that analogy in my eighty-year-old where does it put the nuclear
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:27,711	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They have their own faults with their own guys but their own gums and their job is to shoot anybody who
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tries to take
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A core without presidential authorization for the rest of his presidential term Truman doesn't
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Budge the nuclear power is his
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:43,583	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And he's alone but the technology starts to make it trickier to do this
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:47,423	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If you want a very small atomic bomb you can't
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Separate the pin out from that is just not going to happen it's physically like glued to the explosives and things like that
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So it's 1953 just a few years before held enter the military
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Returns to Fort Benning Georgia
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	President Eisenhower comes to power and he's a former General right exactly is a little bit less concerned about
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Who has control over these nuclear weapons so he
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Eases up a little bit in his administration
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm Potomac weapons small ones are to be treated as basically any other kind of weapon
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Awesome this is archival footage from 1960 when President Eisenhower is getting a first look at some of the newest addition to the new
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nuclear Arsenal
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Binoculars to watch helicopters
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At that time they were really creative with their new nuclear weapon
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Does he
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:47,583	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Continue to maintain authority over the bigger bombs he allows them to be transferred to the military but he said
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:52,703	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Says Don't drop them without my permission but there are some cases in which she says
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Under really bad circumstances you can use some of these weapons without my permission compared to Truman he's really shifting that
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	PowerBack
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Does the military
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:07,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yes but by the time Kennedy is the president
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Harold has 24 his Pilot in the Air Force

EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:25,471	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Can you get rid of anxiety
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Some of these anxieties bubble-up and popular these are these are kind of out there
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	How to drop the bomb on popular culture is
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:44,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	In nuclear fear

EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:12,575	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And the problem is you put up a lot of bombers only a matter of time before they'll expect one.
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Cracker of a malfunction
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	B-52 carrying hydrogen Munitions and so indeed there are a bunch of accidents
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Bombers crash with hydrogen bombs on board a crashed in Spain and drop hydrogen bombs
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	One of us gets dropped in Greenland
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Play crash in the United States numerous times there's one in the South for a bomb basically land on somebody's house in the comic book
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:40,992	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Atomic atomic bomb landed on someone's house
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:44,320	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	B-47 jet Over Florence South Carolina
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Thomas tomorrow
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	On the water
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:55,072	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That would be the most terrifying thing imagine you're just brushing your teeth and then
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And there's a knock on the door is excuse me we going to remove this
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:06,336	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So does all these accidents and on top of that America is keeping a bunch of its bombs and bases all over the world
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:12,736	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And I start to worry that some of these bases are are not American bases and there aren't that many Americans on them
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nukes are kept at a base in Turkey turkey's our friend not a problem but they're like
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Two American guys guarding these things they have the keys to turn these missiles on
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:29,376	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What do you need to do if Turkey wants to become a nuclear power over the head with a hammer and take the keys
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:35,776	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Now turkey is a nuclear power yeah this is more or less what Kennedy says
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Waxing Instinct The Truman that he issues a directive which says no weapons can be kept overseas unless they have
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:42,944	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Have locks on them
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:49,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	In the first versions of these are very crude they're like literally combination locks we like bikes yeah they're pretty simple
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:53,952	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So you're you're doing this technological enabling of this kind of
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Vast political metaphor that the president is in control of these nuclear weapons at all times
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,144	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Truman wanted it
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Close
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To the chest
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And then Eisenhower wanted it out there and then Kennedy now is pulling it back in right exactly
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At the time this felt safe
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Who better to trust in the
EDL	00:23:15,968	00:23:18,784	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	President with something so powerful to get in the world
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And even after Kennedy the laws around this solidify the power stays
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	With the president yes
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,720	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But then
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You got this guy
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	People have got to know whether or not their President Richard milhous Nixon
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And this feeling of safety and really
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	All trust in the presidency
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,056	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Starts to a road
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:47,456	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So in the last days of his presidency the Watergate break-in they're all the investigations
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nixon was drinking more than the president perhaps ought to
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He was under intense amount of
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,624	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Stress
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He did a few things that made people uncomfortable the most infamous Moment Like This happened in the summer
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	1974
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:08,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yes when all the Watergate stuff was really coming to a hat p was talking with two congressmen
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And he was trying to impress upon them what a waste of time this quote little burglary was and
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Give an example of
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,920	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A minor this was he explain that
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:24,832	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	His responsibilities were huge if he wanted to he could go into the other room pick up a telephone in 20 minutes
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	60 million people would be dead
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Wow he said that he said this
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And that's exactly the kind of situation Harold was thinking about when he asked his question like
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Since I'm the guy with my hand on the he just kind of curious here
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is there a system for making sure a president doesn't just walk into the other room pick up the phone and order me to kill six
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A million people
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	There is presently a degree of doubt in my mind
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So he asks this question first
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Out loud then he does it in writing and then I was pulled out of training unequal survival
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:05,792	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	6 days before graduation that leads to a series of meetings with Superior officers
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:11,936	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tell him that I need to have more faith in our leaders know not to question him
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:17,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And I was told I didn't have a need to know that leads to a trial
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Where he has this one meeting with this military judge you basically here I have your question in my hand I will tear it up
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And we will can all forget this ever happened but I still wanted to question answered and then that leads to appeal
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And he's writing letters I would spend days and nights virtually continuously writing to congressman
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:43,168	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Writing and writing to the president but it really didn't matter at all what I had to say
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He's basically like okay fine I I don't
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:51,872	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Want to be a launch officer anymore I asked to be you no real sign if they weren't going to give the info
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Cremation but instead of reassigning him my
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:57,760	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Promote Lieutenant Colonel with withheld
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I was removed from flight status so I no longer would get flight pay
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:08,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I was thin permanently disqualified from the human reliability program
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Along with that my
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Top secret security
EDL	00:26:12,864	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Clarence was taken away from me
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And once you have a security clearance remove and your permanent disqualify there's no hope
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,104	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For your career
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,712	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I pursued every Avenue available to me
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,296	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To have my military record corrected
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And to have the findings reversed
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And to Romanian Air Force
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,232	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Only after I exhausted
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	All of my Appeals
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Was I ordered

EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I don't why why a man knows it like the whole military thing you got to stay in your lane you don't question your spear
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Why would they
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:03,808	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What's the question why why would they why what's wrong with him asking the question why is it such a
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Well I'll tell you right after we take a break

EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And I request
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:47,072	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:53,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about those times
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So did something
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:28:00,896	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It just means you lean back and say wow how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:04,224	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:11,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of the musical score
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:22,656	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:26,240	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Don't have anything to do with the test if you have a story please share it with us
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Go to radiolab.org brilliance
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Record a short audio message for us
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Again that's radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hey I'm Jared I'm wrought iron Robert krulwich Radiolab until lots of why was Harold question such a threat
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Here's how it was put to me. The other side has to know the only reason the only way that a phrase with this
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:08,992	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The whole the whole premise is deterrence not has been our founding philosophy
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:15,392	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Since we develop these things this is dr. Sonya McMullen and I'm a former Air Force missileer
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	She had her hand on the nuclear keys from 1997 to 2001
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	She means Arizona
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Countries from nuking us
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Will Newcomb
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Right back
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:45,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But if the other side doesn't believe that you will respond in kind
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:53,024	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Then it doesn't work you have to believe my thread is legit I have to be credible so if you're the guy who's hand is on
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Kaneki when the order comes down to launch there can't be any doubt that you will do what you were ordered to do exactly
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So the problem with somebody like Carol is it you're in if you start allowing people to at the bottom to start making up their mind
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:11,200	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Then it's not a credible threat cuz I want to understand in your own mind why they had to have a
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Committee to sit in judgment on him and review
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Some sort of
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Factory I don't know what
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm I'm in Plano I haven't seen their side of it I'm
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Filing
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To get access to that side we'll see how that goes
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So I found this actually just we got this morning so we actually ended up finding a statement by the
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:34,240	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Commander in Chief of Strategic Air Command
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:36,544	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At General Russ Doherty
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,824	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I don't know if you have
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:44,224	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	CNET Harold but it's going to be fair we thought we should let Harold respond to what do you know about
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	No but he would see us
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Think that Commander cheapest teaching her come in right right right until let me just read to you what he said sure
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:59,840	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Demetrius hesitation initiated extensive hearings and administrative procedures
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:04,960	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Later he professed that he really would turn keys and that is hesitation and be misunderstood
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Examine the record thoroughly and discovered that for a fact
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Kid repeated several times in the record that he would readily turn keys
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:19,296	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Each instance is affirmative assertion was followed immediately by a personal
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Subjective qualification
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:25,696	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yes he would turn Keys upon receipt of an authentic order from proper Authority
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:28,000	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If he thought the order was legal
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:32,352	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If he thought the circumstances necessitated an ICBM launch
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:35,936	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If he was convinced that it was irrational moral necessity and so on
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Every affirmative answer was qualified by a subjective condition
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:44,896	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I did not say that anywhere
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,688	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nowhere did I say that
EDL	00:31:47,456	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nowhere did I use those words
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,576	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm sorry but
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,112	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That's just
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Dutchess Falls
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:32:02,048	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That doesn't surprise me according to Harold he never wanted to doubt an order coming from the president
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Moon
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:04,096	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Let there had to be
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Some
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,680	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Sort of check and balance
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So that one man
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Couldn't just
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:11,776	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	On a whim
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:18,944	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Order the launch of nuclear weapons just wanted to be told that something like that existed so that
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,480	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He and his fellow officers
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:26,112	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Would not have to have a conflict of conscience and that we not put anybody in a position
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,392	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Horror
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They're just following orders
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:34,816	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm throwing our conscious to the for when I think it's an affront
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To play the game of you don't have the need to know
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:43,264	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Someone that's doing one of the most serious
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Grave jobs that there is
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Any armed forces
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Ento
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Harold never got an answer to his question
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We decided to make it
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Our question where where do you get somebody who's allowed to question the president because we know
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I know that my time you get to the bottom there's no way that's possible so what about the guy above that let's say there's an officer who's one more up to
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:15,520	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is he going to question me order well I don't know he's getting it from the general to coordinate all of the nuclear attacks but if it
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I got the ham it must be a legitimate order right maybe those top-level major heads of the military branches
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:28,320	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Maybe they get to I don't know and so my question is where if anywhere if the president issues an order
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tammy will they say no
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	After a lot of digging around Alex says that he thinks my guess is you're not allowed to question the president
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:45,728	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	More than a couple steps down from the very top if you're allowed to question the present at all maybe we can do it and when we talk
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:47,008	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To Sonya McMullen
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Element lyrics
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:51,616	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	She also thought that the Secretary of Defense could
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:53,408	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Probably provide a check
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:56,992	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The Secretary of defense's that is the first person to say
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hey let's let's think about this
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:00,576	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I think about this in detail
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	All right
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:03,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We're ready
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:04,928	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Okay
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,208	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This is Bill Perry
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:10,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Formally Secretary of Defense 1960 defense of the United States
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:14,144	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So we decided to ask an actual Secretary of Defense
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:16,960	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	William Perry served under President Clinton
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:19,776	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Up from 1994 to 1997
EDL	00:34:19,776	00:34:25,664	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yeah let's just pretend for a moment that the president issues you an order that you disagree with
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:28,480	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Because you don't think the president is of right mind or
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,504	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Sober
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:30,528	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Or whatever
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:35,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What Authority do you have a secretary of defense avanee
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:36,672	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The system is set up
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:41,280	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So that only the president has the authority to order a nuclear war
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:42,816	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nobody has the right
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:44,608	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The countermand that decision
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:45,888	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Team I choose
EDL	00:34:46,656	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To call the secretary defense or the Secretary of State
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,032	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:54,336	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To get his advice was counseled
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:59,200	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But he even if it does that you may or may not accept that counsel
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:03,552	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If you as Secretary of Defense say to the president he says let's
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Go and you say let's not
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:12,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Can you vote if he calls me and then if I say that mr. president that would be a very serious mistake don't do
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:15,328	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Do that he might or might not accept my advice
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:18,656	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Are you necessary to launch like
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Suppose
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:25,312	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Everybody in the room thought that it was a bad idea would he still be able to do it yes
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:31,200	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He has the exact call directly to the Strategic Air Command to do the launching
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	End
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:37,600	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They will respond to his orders they don't call the sexual defense
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:39,648	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For the children's sake should I do this
EDL	00:35:40,160	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They do it
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:46,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yeah so in our training we are conditioned
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,584	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Almost like
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:53,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Pavlovian tok this is Doctor Bruce Blair he was a missile launch officer
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At the exact time that Harold was training to become one and ever since then he basically spent the whole rest of his career
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We are studying nuclear command-and-control and I wrote studies
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:09,344	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So classified that the Pentagon demanded that I not be allowed to read them anymore
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:15,744	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We asked him like why does it work like this why would we give one person that much power it's always
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It's always been set up that way and it came out of the
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,656	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Cold War
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You know in the 1960s
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:25,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I don't know what
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	By the 1960s the US and the Soviet Union were building icbm's which of these nuclear missiles they could
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:33,920	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Go from a silo in one country
EDL	00:36:33,920	00:36:36,480	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To Target in the other in the matter of minutes
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:42,368	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So if the Soviets ever launched their missiles at us for under a missile attack
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:45,184	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	There's very little time to assess the attack
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To brief the president on his
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Options
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Because the Assumption was that the Soviets would Target our missiles are icbms
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:57,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And they would be the first to go into the office for the president
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Has to decide whether to launch ICBM
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Before the other metros land for
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Any incoming missiles could destroy
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Command and control system
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	In
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,504	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That horses
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:14,368	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The present to make a decision on how to respond immediately because missiles are flying in it
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:17,440	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	4 miles per second is about 6 or 7 minutes
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:19,744	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To make that decision
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Sex with a decision process
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is too short
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,376	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For any kind of
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:28,960	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Thoughtful or serious deliberation and the pressure is intense
EDL	00:37:28,960	00:37:30,752	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And there I think you
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,776	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Would find that
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Different presidents would respond differently
EDL	00:37:34,592	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And their character their temperament
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:38,176	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Are they thinking people
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Where are they intuitive people
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Coopers Pond instinctively in ISO
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,648	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	See a lot of variation in the way
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,416	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Presidents
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	React to a nuclear emergency
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:54,304	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	If the president United States now for
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	50 years is followed at all times twenty-four hours a day by a military aid
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Current football this is Van Vice President Dick Cheney also up former Secretary of Defense
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:07,360	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Talking on Fox News Sunday back in 2008
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:13,760	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He could watch the kind of a devastating attack the world's member saying he doesn't have to check with anybody he doesn't have to go
EDL	00:38:13,760	00:38:19,136	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Call the Congress he doesn't have to check with the court he has that Authority because of the nature of the world we live in
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,048	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It bothers me
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Immensely that the only area that there is not a checking balance
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is a 1
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,752	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Zack and literally result in the end of the world
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They seem strange to me
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Have you thought about this at all and wondered whether there's a better way to do this yes I have and what would you suggest
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I have a
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:51,648	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Specifically proposing to continue to propose unsuccessfully again former secretary defense William Perry
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Louis phase-out are icbms and to the extent we have to have a nuclear deterrence
EDL	00:38:56,768	00:38:59,328	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We limited the submarines in airplanes because
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:01,120	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They don't have to lunch
EDL	00:39:01,632	00:39:05,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	In 5 minutes or 6 minutes for 7 minutes and when it comes to preemptive strikes
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:09,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He says how we have before the Congress now a bill making a modification
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,360	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Which has the less
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,640	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Ellesse United States
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:14,944	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Has been verifiably attacked
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Then the president
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,272	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hash before you
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:20,064	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yvonne Chisholm nuclear weapons
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,856	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Has to go to Congress
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Full commission
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:29,280	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So far our bill is very simple this is congressman Ted lieu and he and Senator Ed Markey are the guys who off
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,816	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	After the Bell Jessie says
EDL	00:39:31,584	00:39:37,472	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Before the president can launch a nuclear first strike the president must first get a declaration of war from Congress
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,544	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I believe that you introduced this
EDL	00:39:40,544	00:39:41,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Bill
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Before the elect
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:43,872	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Sarah Wright
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,896	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Absolutely
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:51,808	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Senator Mark I believe we need a structural fix We Believe actually Hillary Clinton was going to be president
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:52,576	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is Bill
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:54,624	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I would have replied to her
EDL	00:39:54,624	00:39:56,160	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And that's because
EDL	00:39:56,928	00:40:00,768	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The fate of humanity in our world should not rest on one person
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:07,168	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And so are you seeing this as just as you sizing the stop is this a systemic problem or is this a
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,960	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Problem with one person who
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:12,800	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Just happened to have the office right now it's actually a systemic problem
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:17,152	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And it's also a problem with the current person in the office
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:17,920	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Who's the president
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:21,760	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But you can see future President right could be elected with
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:24,832	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Judgment or temperament issues or maybe
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	They simply go to Advanced age and get
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:30,720	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Alzheimer's right or or some other
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:33,280	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I sort of issue
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:34,304	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That's why we can't
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,120	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Have a system queer
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:41,216	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	There's so little checks and balances do you know about this bill or
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:43,008	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Have you heard from now actually down
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:45,568	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That's that's interesting
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That is a very interesting bill
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,200	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	.
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:53,760	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Let me let me say this way
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:58,112	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	On one hand I agree
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:03,744	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Because of God I always like to have checks and balances
EDL	00:41:03,744	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	On the other hand
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I also think that it
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It it says to a potential adversary
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Enid
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Now there's doubt
EDL	00:41:19,360	00:41:21,408	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So there to sort of values here
EDL	00:41:21,408	00:41:22,176	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	1 is
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Your Humane interest in making sure that
EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:30,112	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The end of the world if it comes to that
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,416	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is happening for good reason
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:36,256	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	LOL just reason it's best you can define it
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,024	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:40,352	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The ongoing hope that by making this
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Art system
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:44,192	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Credible that they will never have end of the world
EDL	00:41:45,984	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So my question to you is like how do you weigh those together
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:52,128	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Well
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:53,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It's
EDL	00:41:54,943	00:41:56,223	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That's the Dilemma
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:56,991	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,015	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	You know that's the Dilemma
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	So after the military force Harold to retire
EDL	00:42:26,175	00:42:27,711	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He became a truck driver
EDL	00:42:28,223	00:42:31,807	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And once I got that job I made up my mind
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But I was going to devote my time
EDL	00:42:33,855	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm making a living for my family into that company
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Then I wasn't going to be off dealing with this subject anymore
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Eventually he started doing Addiction Counseling at the Salvation Army mostly with homeless
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:50,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	How how what's your sort of
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Emotional state around all this right now like how often is this something you still think about it how
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What do you how do you feel right now
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Hell I'm
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:02,015	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I'm just
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I just I think that
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Common sense I think
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:09,951	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:12,511	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Goodness in human beings
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:14,559	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Babes
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:15,839	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	4
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,631	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	A resolution dance
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,191	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I just think it's nothing need
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For that
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:22,495	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Is
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:26,079	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At least as great now as it
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:28,127	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Ever been in the history of our Republic
EDL	00:43:29,151	00:43:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And I might add on a personal level that
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	When I was really
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Committed
EDL	00:43:37,343	00:43:39,391	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To the military to the Air Force
EDL	00:43:39,391	00:43:42,463	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Volunteered several times in 02
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:46,815	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To do my duty with respect the Vietnam War and
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,839	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I just felt
EDL	00:43:48,351	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That I had asked a very reasonable question
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That deserved
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	An answer and
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And it was not
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:58,335	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	For me alone

EDL	00:52:37,247	00:52:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	To place early in the morning of March 1st 1954 search been a while
EDL	00:52:42,879	00:52:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tell a couple weeks back the writers Sam Keen put us in touch with this guy
EDL	00:52:46,719	00:52:50,559	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But was quite traumatic and then hard to forget
EDL	00:52:51,071	00:52:52,607	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	How old are you on that day
EDL	00:52:52,607	00:52:55,679	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	In 1954 I was 9 years old 9 years old
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:53:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	His name is Tony De Brum he is an ambassador for the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific
EDL	00:53:01,567	00:53:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He tells a story about a particular moment that happened
EDL	00:53:04,639	00:53:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	When he was nine
EDL	00:53:06,175	00:53:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	One a day very early in the morning
EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	At that moment is that the early one morning hours I was out fishing with my grandfather
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:18,975	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It was customary we lived in
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Two to go net fishing
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:24,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Throw net fishing for scad
EDL	00:53:25,631	00:53:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tony says he and his grandpa were out on the beach
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:29,983	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Before the sun has risen
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:33,055	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And they waited through the water tossing their net
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Pulling a back
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:36,383	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Tough it out
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Pulling it back
EDL	00:53:38,175	00:53:43,807	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Natalie done that for a while the settlers took beginning to rise from the East
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:46,623	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And I was carrying the basket he was throwing the net
EDL	00:53:47,391	00:53:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Turn the flashlight off
EDL	00:53:49,695	00:53:56,095	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We are temporarily blinded by the Flash
EDL	00:53:56,095	00:54:02,495	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It was as if someone had walked up to you with a with a flash camera and and
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Nnn took a shot writing inches from your eyes
EDL	00:54:09,151	00:54:09,919	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I cannot
EDL	00:54:10,431	00:54:14,015	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	With any certainty tell you how many seconds past
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:21,439	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:27,839	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I felt the shock it was like the real
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Heavy burst of wind going through real and it turned away from the light and back
EDL	00:54:34,239	00:54:40,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Towards the shore where you can see the the vegetation moved
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	It's Indescribable I thought it was the end of the world
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But Tony didn't know is it 300 miles away the US had just test
EDL	00:54:53,439	00:54:59,839	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Did a bomb they called Castle Bravo it was a hydrogen bomb but a thousand times
EDL	00:54:59,839	00:55:06,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Strong as the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima and then the
EDL	00:55:06,239	00:55:12,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The rumble and Roar and the Thunder of the the sound of the explosion
EDL	00:55:12,639	00:55:19,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	This was not one big explosion that goes just boom and that's it the Chain Reaction caused it to
EDL	00:55:19,039	00:55:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	222 roll like thunder and then
EDL	00:55:25,439	00:55:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	He says the sky erupted everything turn red the sky 2
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Turn red ocean was red the sand was red my grandfather was threatened
EDL	00:55:38,239	00:55:44,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Fish report for rent so holds that the whole atmosphere the whole hemisphere
EDL	00:55:44,639	00:55:51,039	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	The effect was like you're standing under a glass bowl and somebody put blood over
EDL	00:55:51,039	00:55:57,183	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	We we were terrified
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:07,167	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	That explosion in the many others like it
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:10,239	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Would poison the Marshall Islands poisonous people
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	But in that moment Tony says
EDL	00:56:12,799	00:56:14,335	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	His grandpa just stood there
EDL	00:56:15,359	00:56:16,639	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	Listening to the explosions
EDL	00:56:17,407	00:56:23,807	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	And staring at the Blood Red Sky it seemed to have lasted for what
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:30,207	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	What seemed like hours I am Nas
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:36,607	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	72 years old and every time I speak about this my My Skin So cross night
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:42,751	| radiolab_podcast17nukes |	I still get goosebumps
