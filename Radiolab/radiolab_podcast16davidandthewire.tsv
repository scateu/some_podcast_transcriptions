EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,696	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	There it just started to get old for 1
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Every day when his friends would go off to class
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:40,864	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	David would have to go to work during the day I was working as a janitor at the University where my friends went
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And during the evenings I would deliver pizzas
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,008	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Put on like this for years
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:53,408	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You know day after day they would party but then in the morning when his friends would go to class he would go and clean
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:54,944	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Toilets and then deliver pizzas
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:58,272	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'll do sophomore year they would go to class he would clean toilets
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,552	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Andover Pizza
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,088	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Junior year class
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Toilets
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:06,464	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Pizzas and like I think looking back on it now I think
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	There was this rage that started to build up inside
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Inside me because
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:16,192	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I mean I was really sick of cleaning the toilets of kids in the dorms who
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I resent but are also but I also recognize are able to do something that I
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Wasn't able to do and you know all my friends were at that University and they were about to graduate and
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:28,224	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So I think I was also worried that like
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Well they're all going to go off and live these lies and I'm going to be stuck here cleaning toilets in the top of that by the time
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Most of David's friends for seniors
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He was spending his weekends in jail for driving on a suspended license
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,072	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	To my life at that point was like
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Cleaning toilets in the morning delivering pizzas in the evening and then every weekend I was in jail
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:52,800	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It was kind of this
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,080	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Breaking Point
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:03:00,224	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	One thing one thing we did a lot of like we listen to all the punk music my friends were in punk bands
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And we would just like to get really drunk and like yell into the speakers
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:07,136	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I like three or four nights a week in up
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:13,024	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And one night we were doing that it was me and my friend Danny and my friend Mark and something just snapped inside me
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I got lost it
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:18,656	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Just started like grabbing chairs and hurling them for Windows and just like
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,984	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Smashed out all the windows in our house
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You couldn't see the floor cuz there was just like wreckage everywhere and I was all bloody
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I was just like
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,992	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Present tense it was
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,576	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I don't think it hit me until the next morning
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,368	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	When I saw what it look like
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Like a hurricane a black rip through the house
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,744	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah and all his friends
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	IPhone just went to stun their sort of like
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What's going on
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then you know when you when you confront
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,424	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	A reality like that
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Everything just sort of gets Stripped Away and you're just left with this question that's like
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Who am I
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And what am I doing with my life
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,480	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Around that time
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,528	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	David was driving around delivering pizzas
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:10,368	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Listen to the radio and WBEZ Chicago This American Life
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,904	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Ameriglass heard the story
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:15,232	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Vistacare story couple test
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I was hired to interview men and women in the state of Utah who receive Medicaid support for treatment of men
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Mental illnesses
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Generally
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And it just like
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Stop me in my tracks I saw the stories by a guy named Scott
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,103	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Carrier the frequent contributor of This American Life in
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's basically about how he gets his new job he gets this job
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Driving around the state of Utah interviewing schizophrenic people
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Giving them this test
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I took the job because I had no other
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:46,207	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I took the job because I just quit my steady job my profession
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And this is happening at a point where Scott's life is falling apart
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,399	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What I wanted more than anything was to put my boss on the floor
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Stand on his throat
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Watching guy talks about how he hates his boss and my wife moved out
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:05,919	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Took the kids and everything's wife had just left him so I took the job and did the job
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,759	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And my life will never be the same
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And David says
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,135	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	As soon as he heard that story I remember thinking like
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:19,231	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I need to figure out how to become a radio producer that's what I need to do
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Why why does he
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Well
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I think first off
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,143	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Scott carrier is
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:30,495	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Really good at what he does is something about him that is magnetic
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Right it gets people thinking I want to do that
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,103	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But maybe more importantly
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	In the story
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Scott is
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Stuck
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Not too dissimilar from
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Where David finds himself and
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Scott does he turns his stuckness into a story
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And in doing so kind of
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Gives it meaning
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:54,047	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's getting its Rising above your situation sort of
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	David hears everything's like
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Maybe I can do that to make sense yeah it was like okay
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	This is my
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Ticket
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Soap that summer he lined up a job at this camp this summer camp in Upstate New York
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I bought this minidisc recorder shirt
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	10th he and his buddy Mark who had just graduated
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	They left Colorado and headed to Upstate New York my idea was like okay I'll just go around and
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:35,263	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Kelly's recordings and then I'll write these stories about what it all means and
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	They want
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Sole on the road but with
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,175	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Recordings
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:48,575	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He recorded the kids at the camp this bar fight one night when he was out
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Can a counselors

EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's a live recording what's happening right now and yes I distinctly remember just being in
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Delete all of hearing recordings that I had made
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	When nothing is happening
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The idea that I can make a recording and listen to it
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It was like
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,415	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Like early man
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	She's a mirror you know and just can't stop staring at it
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah he wasn't it
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,863	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Interviewing
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	People are anything like that he'd sort of decided
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That he wanted to record moments
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	As they happen
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Any figured
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The best way to do that was to record
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,151	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Secretly
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I had cut a small hole in all of the pants and shorts that had in the pocket
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So I could get up in the morning
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,831	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Put the
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:56,927	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Minidisc recorder in my pocket and then I'd run the cord down my shirt
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And anytime
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:01,023	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Something interesting was happening I would slip my
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Figure my pocket in just press record with at first just some moments here and there
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:13,823	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Possible little scenes for a story Maybe
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Abraham

EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He was in Applebee's
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Working as a waiter and living in his parents basement
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:28,415	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Right but he did eventually save up enough money to travel again I went to Alaska things like that
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And he says that
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Win 10
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:35,839	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Bad like at Applebee's you needed these recordings to make his life feel like it had
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Meaning when times were good
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He couldn't stop recording because he was worried that he was going to miss some
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah occasionally like something would go wrong like I lost
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:49,663	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Three or four recorders they broke down over the course of the years has recording
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And whenever our quarter broke that would be a. Where I have to wait for the new recorder to come and I just
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Felt like
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	On edge all the time you know like I need to be a missing I'm missing out you don't like in this weird Twisted way like I feel like I was Miss
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,511	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Missing out on life
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Because I wasn't recording it so when you would get the recorder it would be like a relief oh yeah I was like thank God I can you know
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,727	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Is pressure would be releasing I can go back to recording
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I would just feel like myself again you know
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But then
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:25,503	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Hey guys ride ahead of you or behind David ended up down in Seattle where he met back up with Mark
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,527	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Mark and I got in some big arguments in Seattle before I left
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What is a woman
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He just told me when I depart
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Hate the fact that you record me all the time
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,911	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:44,703	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It always recording
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Text conversation to
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:52,895	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I don't know why and he just laid it all out for me
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You know like he was someone who spent
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:18:00,831	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	His day all day in a recording studio meticulously laying down perfect tracks you know that
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That was his life
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And so to him that idea that you would just sort of like record everything it was wrong for a lot of reasons
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	One of which was he just didn't think that the experience is worn to that
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:18,239	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then he had like philosophical objections to it
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That like
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What makes life
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Great and worth living is that it is this bleeding thing at
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Temporary hem
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And when you are trying to constantly record it and capture it
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Georgia
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Taken away from that
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Aspect of life
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Play don't keep trying to capture like the essence of this thing just
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:53,055	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Be in the essence of a thing
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	David
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Saying that

EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,367	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	If you're missing the important things
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:08,159	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And the doctor finally she
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Said he didn't want to be recorded anymore and it was like really getting away by friendship cuz like
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What puts a ceiling on where your relationship can go when someone
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Feels like
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:26,847	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	They can't open up to you in that way it just puts this wedge between you and the way that's just like awful did you stay
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Stop recording at this point for well I couldn't stop I got that fire just like
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I don't know whether it was OCD or whatever was like I was just like I couldn't stop recording and so I was always recording and
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,647	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The recording was like
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,231	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Almost like a uniform for this
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,767	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Person that I wanted to be was like
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's like you're on in a play
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You think you're living this life and then when the disc stops suddenly like the lights go up in your realize
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's all fake
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Do you like face a dude like
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You just drifting
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	At this point David has around
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	2000 hours of tape
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:11,903	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Because he keeps on recording is not really hanging out with Mark anymore or any ends up just
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Drifting down to New Orleans
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	This is not
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Grey long after Hurricane Katrina
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And it's like you know like
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You know I don't answer with a flood and is like
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'd like to listen to people like heroin Journeys
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then like all this Injustice is that they face
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So we decided
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	To do something that he never really done before
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And started interviewing
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:36,735	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	People have an assisted living in New Orleans East
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,271	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Telling their stories
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That wasn't changed
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Change that much since Katrina
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	With their permission not recording them secretly
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So what did you leave those stories on too
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:56,703	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	New Orleans Public Radio Station wwoz Street Talk
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Stories of New Orleans cultural rebuilding
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,079	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'm telling you man I appreciate that discipline
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Cuz I have growing up man I was growing up
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Just terrible
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:08,479	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Then at night he go home and
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:11,039	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And he would listen to audio from The Wire
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Tape of like me and some bar and
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,928	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I think
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Super drunk and it's like
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:27,936	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What did I think this matter
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Get out like
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,752	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Why
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then also dislike
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Dynamic started to change my mind
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,384	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	We're like
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,432	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's one thing to record your own life
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:44,576	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then he asked me before I was also recording other people but it was always framed around me
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:47,136	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And everyone else was just sort of like supporting characters
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,440	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Then I was like
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	This is not about me it's about other people and like
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:56,864	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Suddenly it did start to feel dirty to record
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:00,960	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	People that was like all of that so we can go ahead and I just felt worse and worse about recording
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:03,008	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:06,080	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then I just stopped as I don't want to I don't want to do this anymore
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:10,944	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What about that feeling you were talking about just moments ago or wear without
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The recorder
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:14,016	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Recording what's happening
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,808	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You felt as if you were missing out
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That experience was kind of wasted
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Because you hadn't got the chance to record it
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I mean I didn't go away that definitely didn't go away
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I mean I feel like that's still to this day
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:29,120	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I sometimes feel like man I wish I was recording this you know
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,680	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,520	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Force me to really think hard about what moments in life
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,080	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	We're worth capturing 120
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He doesn't like it if you do try to
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Capture a moment
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Then
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,456	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You're kind of
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Out of them
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,528	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But if you don't
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Then
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,832	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's gotten
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Recording has the potential to be lost
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Right I think that yeah we all can relate to this idea
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,000	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But for David
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,048	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The Crux of that
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:00,864	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Pension do it or not to do it like
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:05,472	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That became really difficult after him in part because of what happens next
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,312	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Few months after he had quit recording are you starting to mark
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:12,384	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Who I am so back from Seattle is very
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,944	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Happy to hear the David wasn't recording anymore
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:19,808	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And some are decided to go down to New Orleans and visit David and their buddy Danny was down there too
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,832	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And this is hard cuz I haven't really
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Hold the real story about half with Mark I'm trying to think
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'll tell you the real story and
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Dan and Danny and Mark and I were really close the three of us
EDL	00:23:39,520	00:23:40,800	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And one thing we do
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	A couple times a year we would all go out to the mountains together and just have this
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Great trip together like as friends
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And so
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	We are going to do that in New Orleans and so
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Garner bikes and we wrote down to the river
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Set along the river for a while and then we took the ferry over to the
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Westbank the other side of the river
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	New Orleans is like glittering across the water got stoned and it was just
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:13,568	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Magical like that for a long time to talking like having those who deep
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Philosophical conversations for the first time in a long time that was not recording wasn't worried about capturing the moment
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So my mind was free to not think about the recording
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Pinot and then I was actually
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,904	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	More present in some way you know
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,952	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And it just felt like
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,816	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It always did when we were close back in the mountains in Colorado you know it was like a great
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Moment
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:37,120	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I wanted to keep hanging out there
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:44,800	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Markers are getting kind of answer you wanted to go explore the city you know you want to go exploring and I was just like
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,104	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Didn't really feel like I was just sort of like
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Didn't want to be one of the people I was happy to be there with them and then Mark
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Just jumped up and took off like
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Bridget away and we were like well that was
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,880	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Weird uncle's very strange
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	David says that
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Mark said something in them on the butt
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Can't
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:09,120	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I can't remember exactly what and so we like God on our bikes and we're only a
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Maybe I don't know maybe a hundred yards 200 yards from the
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,496	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Very it was park there
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,336	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	By the time we got
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	To the bridge that connects the land
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:23,712	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Fairy I saw that my bike was laying on its side
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	On the ramp
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I was like well that's weird you know my mind and my life take it back about it I feel like I'm having very slowly why is ma
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Mark cycling down why
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	All those people shouting they're looking
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:40,352	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	End of The River Why are they looking over and then I look in there over and there's mark
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Annies
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Swimming in the Mississippi and he shouting something and I can't figure out what he's saying and I was just like
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Holyshit like
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,616	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	This is really bad
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,456	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I got really really scared I look Danny and Danny looked
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,248	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Totally terrified
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:59,296	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	She started again I was going Downriver I was just the river and so there was a point
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I could see
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Off the distance there was a boat like a rescue boat or something and gotten in the water
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And Mark started to drift around bent and he disappeared out of you
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:16,192	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	How to walk up and down
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The river
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Looking for Mark
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,056	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	They couldn't find him
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,080	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Then it gets dark
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:24,384	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And then he might just head home
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,176	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And wait for news there
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	The next morning
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,736	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Still no news
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,040	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Few days later
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Authorities 8 they gave up their official search for Mark and in assume that he was dead
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,696	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And a week or so later
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,976	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	They found his body
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Get drowned
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,280	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And I should just add
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,560	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But there is
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	No reason to suspect that this was a suicide
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,912	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Yeah I'm sorry the mark
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,680	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Batman tits
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:53,312	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Sensitive story to hear
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Thinking about this is Allen's of like you being with someone who has a
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Compulsion and Obsession that is now under control but still
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,624	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Losing you
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:07,904	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Is there
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I still is there a part of you that
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:15,072	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Wishes you had been recording that day
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I the thing is David says
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,640	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You're not long after my cat died he started going through a lot of his old recordings
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	And sometimes you would hear on the these great
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Moments what you got two of them
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,808	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But a lot of times he says it
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Almost like
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You could hear that ceiling
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,160	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Platypus
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,440	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	According to put on his friendship with more
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:46,816	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Man I want to f****** take a boat down the coast man so bad
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I was acting
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Different than I would have if I had been recording you know like I was conscious that I was on tape all the time
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I also hear my cell phone's recordings often
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Like stepping over him like
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,528	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He'll say something and then I'll jump in in in in just like
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,064	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Clearly I'm just like you
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:12,928	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'm on my own black train of thought and I'm not really listening to him and that bothers me a lot
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I'm glad I don't have
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I think I'm glad that I
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:20,608	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	It's just a hard cuz I'm on 100 glad that I don't have to
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,680	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Live with that Taping that it doesn't exist
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	But at the same time David says
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,264	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I feel like
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Maybe I missed something and maybe there's some part of what happened the night that I can't
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That I missed
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	All I Know It
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,200	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Is that
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,784	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	He just said let's get out of here and I jumped up and like
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I don't remember exactly how he put it I just remember all said he was gone
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	If I had a recording maybe I could make sense of it and maybe something would be more clear about it
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:54,912	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I think about that a lot then I also think what would have Mark what would Market wanted and
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:57,984	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	You know what
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,056	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	That probably

EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:06,432	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Clarity I don't know I don't know ya but I still think about it a lot
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	So think about
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	What I would get from his recordings if I had them
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	Random
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:17,952	| radiolab_podcast16davidandthewire |	I don't
