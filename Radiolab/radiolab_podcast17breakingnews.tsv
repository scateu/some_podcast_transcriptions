EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's going to be a sort of
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The hope is that it will make

EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's our hope right now
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But that's not exactly
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I mean it's
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,223	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Nick Bilton. When when he saw the
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,551	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This video could be Donald Trump's Voice or Vladimir Putin
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,623	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So I saw that and I thought wow
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,159	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If imaginative
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,183	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Audio clips
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Start getting shared around the internet
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is fake news fake conversation between

EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,959	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	About trying to get Trump into the White House or something like that
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I was like what this is
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,543	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is scary stuff
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We're just getting started
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In the words of John Raymond Arnold played by Samuel L Jackson in the movie Jurassic Park in his own voice

EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Things are about to get a lot
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,095	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Forget voices first
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Second because now 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4

EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Demonstration keep starting to wonder how could this be used on the road
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The my original thesis was I will maybe what will happen is that
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You will be able to
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Create 3D Act
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Just like you didn't Star Wars
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Benjani with the Valco stuff to create a fake Hillary Clinton
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And you know Donald Trump having a conversation or making out or whatever it is you want to do
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And that led him to investigate the type of work that you're a dud
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Driving using these terms like facial
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Reenactment and facial manipulation of what the hell do these words
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Me
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,887	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yasso
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,983	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I mean it's a way of animating faces
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	End
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It Started from the movies right remotely control bodies with avatars
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,991	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Think like the aptly-named movie Avatar
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,015	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Or a
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Going a little further back
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,415	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Intelligent life anywhere Toy Story
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:43,231	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How to make the characters come alive what you need is deep
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Expressions of the actors playing them
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,815	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What's the movie space it means that
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You will bring a person to a studio
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Then you
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Your face with you
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Sticky sensory marker things
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And then you'll spend hours hours hours
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Capturing
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The fastest little Dynamics
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like smile
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Keep a smile no teeth had
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:01,919	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Surprised
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Disturbed angry bloated
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In front that they create a virtual character capable of emoting all those
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Expressions in to make that character believable the animator's sometimes have to model
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,535	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Bone structure and muscles
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And if you can imagine this can get very very
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So what people like your ass started to wonder was like
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Can this be done on a bike
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So she and others in the field started feeding videos of faces into computers and
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Train those computers
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To break down the face into a series of points
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Armada starter bolts 250 by 250 that is 62500 points
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	On one human
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,647	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Face and wants to know that's right to get ragged point
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Once you can track how my face move through a video clip by
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,815	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	250 x 250
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Points
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,887	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What can you then do with that information
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,423	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Well
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I can apply the points on the face on a
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,263	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Difference
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Model of a different person
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Now this is this is where things get
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Quite strange
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Because
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Instead of being able to map all of your facial movements onto a computer-generated
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Virtual character or purse
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Whittier and others in this field of
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Facial reenactment have figured out how to do
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is to map your facial moving on to a real person
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,655	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A pre-recorded real person
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What does that even mean
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,287	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The best example of this is I is this
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Piece of software that Nick showed us
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,871	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Add the software that I found
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	From the University student
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Called face2face real-time facial reenactment method that works with any Community webcam
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Download this and when you open it up at this very monotone voice comes in saying
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Uses RGB data for both the source and Target actor
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Set up on the right you got this heavyset man
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Goatee
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Spiked hair on the right Source actor is captured with a standard webcam
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Arching his eyebrows
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	He's pressing his lips
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:12,223	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	She's opening his mouth widely sir like a like if you're making funny faces for a two-year-old kind of thing yeah
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,527	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And then this input drives animation of
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The face in the video shown on the monitor to the left
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	On the left you got this
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Dell computer screen displaying a CNN clip of George Bush
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is a real clip of bush back from 2013 and his face is there looking right at the
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The camera occupies most of that screen
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,495	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You start to notice is up
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	When the man with the goatee smiles
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,359	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	George Bush in the CNN clip
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Also
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Smiles and when the man raises his eyebrows George Bush raises his eyebrows
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You realize this man is complete
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Trolling George Bush's fake wait so this is a guy in the present controlling a
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,671	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	He passed
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	George Bush a real George Bush when old video clip
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A little while back when we were just learning about this up we happen to have her friend Andrew Marantz

EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Clip or you take a clip from cable news
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,887	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And you turn on your webcam
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	However long it takes you to do what you've done
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Same as the shooting a video on your phone

EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,087	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Self example
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,135	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So my Mom leaves in Israel
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And I'm here
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,975	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	NCI
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What is be cool if I could
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Have some guys it's kind of crazy but right but
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If I could have
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Some kind of hologram
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Of her
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Sitting on my couch
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Cher
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,519	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And we can
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,543	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Have a conversation
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Going one step further one of your is colleagues a guy by the name of Steve Seitz and the professor at the University of Washington and I also
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So work part-time at Google
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,271	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	He told me that they see this technology as
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like a building block
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That could one day be used to essentially
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Virtually bring someone back from the dead
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,463	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I just think this technology
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Combined with virtual reality
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,351	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Other Innovations could help me you know just be there in the room with
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Albert Einstein
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Carl Sagan
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That that's about it
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,031	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's what they want to do that's the motivation
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,847	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Ghosts for them yes and
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,639	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	When I was talking to some folks
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Who work in commercials they're developing their own version of
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And the idea is that they're going to make a million or billion dollars
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Because I say you bring
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Jennifer Aniston
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To film some makeup
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:43,423	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And in the makeup commercial in English she says so coming by this product this is the best sort of whatever product
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Right now you got China which is a booming Market you maybe want to Market things to China and you'd really like to be able to use Jennifer
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Problem is Jennifer Aniston doesn't
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Speak Mandarin
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So either you use the same audio clip and you have someone come in and speak Mandarin
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,135	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Over her in the lips don't line up
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Or you have to hire a mandarin-speaking actor to come in
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And do the part of Jennifer Aniston
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	With this technology
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:13,375	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	All you have to do is record Jennifer Aniston once
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You can hire a mandarin speaker
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:20,287	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And the Mandarin speakers voice will be coming out of Jennifer Aniston
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:21,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Mouth as if she had said
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And in front of the camera
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Her lips would be moving as if she were perfect Mandarin speaker
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Exactly
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,503	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Wow
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think I've heard of it is actually a vegetable
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,111	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Oh my God
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I'm Amazed
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Completely frightened
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:39,487	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	By what you're telling me
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:43,583	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	NFL point of what Nick was writing about that they gave me shivers
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That someday if you join the video manipulation with the vocal voice manipulation
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You're the ultimate puppeteer
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,335	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You can create
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,663	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Anyone talking about anything that you want
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In their own voice
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And having any kind of emotion around it
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And you have it right there for everyone to see
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In video
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And all you need to do
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is take that
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,439	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Put it on Twitter or Facebook
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And if it's shocking enough
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Minutes later it everywhere
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like the timing of you guys making this thing and then this explosion of fake news
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:32,479	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like how do you guys think about about how it could be used for
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Nefarious purpose
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Oh yeah it's a good question
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You're coming back or Slytherin
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I feel like when everything college has developed under there is danger of
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,119	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Vdara technology you can create fake videos and song
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,703	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Are there any college fake videos like to create video from audio rights
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But they are fake videos
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But the way that I think about it is that
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like scientists are doing their job in science like
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Invented the technology and science
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's off and then we all need to
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Let's think about the next steps
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I mean that
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:14,975	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And the answer is not clear maybe syndication maybe it's every video should come up with some code now
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's this is
EDL	00:20:16,255	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is like authentic vdrf antique attacks since you don't believe anything else
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:28,031	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah like it maybe was the timing more than anything but I saw this video and it really felt like
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Oh my God like America can't
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,103	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Handle this right now
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like we're in a moment where we're truth seems to be sort of
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	An Open disc what is true is Pez become an open discussion
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And this seems to be adding fuel on the fire of sort of
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,487	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Competing narratives in a way that I
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I find trouble
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And I'm just curious that you don't
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think that
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,007	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think that's people
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:01,055	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If people know the types of knowledge exist
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Then they will be more skeptical
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	My guess
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I don't know
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,455	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But if people know that taking is exceeded
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Everything all that shake that
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Texas
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Fake videos exist fake photos
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Then everyone is more skeptical in what
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	They read
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But like a man in North Carolina I think it's from North Carolina believed from a fake print article that
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Hillary Clinton was running a sex ring out of a pizza
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Parlor in DC which is like
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This man believed didn't shut up with a gun
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,592	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If people are at a moment where they are willing to believe
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Stories is Ludacris's that
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,408	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like I
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:41,248	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Don't expect them to wonder if this video is real or not
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The weather you ask
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And ask it what I'm asking do you are you afraid of the power of this and
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,304	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If not
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Why
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:04,032	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I'm just give you my answer your questions but I'm a scientist
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:10,688	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Not really because I know how I know that because I know that these Technologies reversible
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I mean nobody
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Well
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	There's not
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Nuts
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:20,928	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:22,976	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Too much
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:33,984	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Have you seen the videos otherwise I can tap you okay
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:40,640	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And if we're feeling worried and more than that surprised that the folks making these Technologies weren't
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:44,736	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We decided to do 30 gut check to see if we were totally off basin
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,784	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Get in touch with one of the guys who's on
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The front lines
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Can you describe what was going through your head when you were watching Bush's face
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I can tell you exactly what I was thinking I was thinking
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:57,280	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How are we going to develop a friend to techniques
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:57,792	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Detect this
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is honey for read I am a professor of
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:06,752	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Computer science at Dartmouth College he started like a Sherlock Holmes
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:13,152	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Ace of digital misdeeds which means they spent a lot of time sitting around looking at pictures and videos trying to understand
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,456	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Where has this come from has been manipulated and should be
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:18,272	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We trusted season work for all sorts of organizations
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:22,624	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Beatty the times Reuters want to know if they a picture is fake or
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	They often will ask me you have to leave when
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like this just happened that yesterday images came out of North Korea
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:35,424	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And everytime you just come out of these regimes or there's a history of photomanipulation there are real concerns about this so
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So I was asked to determine if they've been manipulated in some way and if so how had they been manipulated
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And what how did how the heck would you do that well
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:46,432	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Everytime you manipulate data you're going to leave something behind
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Let's say you do some funny business to a photo
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You might create some noticeable Distortion in the picture
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:57,184	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Self but you also might distort the date and we're in the business of basically
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:59,232	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Finding those distortions in the data
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	For example imagine you get sent a photo
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Probably a JPEG jpeg which now is
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,680	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	99% of the image formats that we see out there
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is what is called a lossy compression scheme
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Just a fancy way to say that
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	When a photo is taken and stored as a jpeg
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,408	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The camera you know just to save space
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Throws a little bit of the date away
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:23,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So for example if I went out to the Dartmouth green right now to the picture of the grass
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The camera isn't going to store all those millions of little variations of green hidden in the grass because that would be
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Huge files
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,840	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's going to save space by throwing some of those greens away
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:38,144	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You just don't notice if it changes
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:41,728	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Like a lot or a little bit less than that is grass as far as
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You can talk nice trick every camera has a subtly different pallet of greens that's going to keep and greens at store
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Throw away this
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:55,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Very tremendously from device to device on iPhone compresses the image much more setlist greens and a high
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:59,392	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	High-end icon or ion cannon which would keep more of those variations
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Now if you hold these two pictures side-by-side you might not be able to tell the difference
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But honey says when you look at the underlying pixel
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	There are different recognizable patterns
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You take an image off of your iPhone
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I should be able to go into that JPEG and look at the packaging and say I got this
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Should have come out of an iPhone
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But if that images upload to Facebook and then re-download it or put into Photoshop and re-save
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It will not look like a tiger consistent with an iPhone so basically he can see at the level of the pixels or data whether the picture
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And this is of course just one of many different ways that honey can Spotify
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah let me ask Mike if you could go up against
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The top 100
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,936	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Best counterfeiters
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Do you think you'd catch them
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	10% of the time 50% of the time that have cats what's your sense
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I would say we could probably catch 75% of the face
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But I would say that would take a long time to do this is not an easy task
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And so yeah
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,088	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A sandwich
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,368	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The medium moves
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:04,672	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Does not lend itself to
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Careful forensic analysis of images
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,768	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I'm always amazed that
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Nicodemos you like. You got 20 minutes
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And I'm you would need
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:16,960	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You'll have to day today per image to a very manual on the very human process
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's so
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,544	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is this video editing
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And this audio editing this coming down the pipeline here I guess it should I be
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Should I be terrified
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yes you should know
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Did you really you really mean that
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah I think it's I think it's going to raise the fake news thing to a whole new level
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:44,864	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I did see some artifacts by the way in the videos they are not perfect but that's neither here nor there because the ability
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:49,216	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We have technology to manipulate and alter reality is growing at a Breakneck
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And the ability to disseminate that information is
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I can't stop that by the
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,664	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Because at the end of the day it's always going to
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Easier to create a fake lie detector fake
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Thank you very much
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Dad
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Himself just handed me a cup of water which shows none of you have gotten too big for your britches and that could be a
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Serious problem
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,192	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I would like to have seen Peter Jennings do that
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,960	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Ever
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:25,056	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	For this guy my name is John Klein co-founder and CEO of tap media
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:27,872	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Before that president of CNN us
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:33,248	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Before that I was Executive Vice President of CBS News where I was executive in charge of
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:35,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	60 Minutes 48 hours
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A bunch of others
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And he's had to react to some serious Evolutions in the media industry
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,768	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	He was Manning the helm is social media exploded as
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Smartphones become ubiquitous
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,376	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Consequently he had to deal with figuring out
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:55,008	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How and if to trust thousands of hours of video taken on these smartphones and sended by viewers
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What's a broadcast in
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Why not
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And so we wanted to know how someone in his position would
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Think about the
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Deepfake videos
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Soapweed
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Set of all the different demos and videos we come across just
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To see what he thought
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	First thought was that this is the kind of thing that
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A James Bond villain
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Would put to use or
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,232	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The Joker
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	In Batman
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:18,304	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Ernie's great girl
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,864	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Right wants to be most popular
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,400	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You know I mean this is
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	There's so many ways to abuse
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Blow your mind
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I mean
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,104	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It goes
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,128	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To the
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,920	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Very
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Score of
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,736	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Communication
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What weather television

EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:48,256	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It is what I'm seeing true is what I'm hearing real
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:54,656	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Over the course of your career you've seen multiple technological development state of impacted
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,448	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Intermediates in rather profound ways
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Where is your Terror level right now or your fear level
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Caused by this relative to all of the other
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,616	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Sort of advance
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,640	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Instead of occurred over
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's terrifying
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It is
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:14,624	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Hurdles us even faster toward that point where No One Believes anything
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How do you have a democracy in a country where people can't trust
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Anything that they Siri
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,376	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Anymore
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What we saw happen with
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Fake news during the election cycle was that
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:34,336	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I'm only the lead to matter if anyone
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,616	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Pino

EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Mere seconds
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:45,600	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And that was it
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You don't need a dentist it's job and I think that
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	With this audio stuff
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And the video stuff that's going to
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,024	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's going to come down
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:57,120	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Online in the next few years it's going to do the same thing but
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:30:04,032	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But no one's going to know what's real and what's not
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:05,568	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It says if you think about
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The video that came out Donald Trump from Access Hollywood
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The thing that was really interesting about that video
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You can do anything
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:24,000	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Grandmother you don't actually see Donald Trump until the very last second when he gets off the bus
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:27,840	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How are you I only hear him
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:33,216	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And so if that technology existed today I can guarantee you

EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:54,880	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah we should give it a spin

EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think it's entirely possible
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I just decided I would be careful what it is

EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,568	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,664	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	How did they do that
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:23,712	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:26,784	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:27,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Do you
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:33,952	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:38,816	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:45,728	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart but doesn't

EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Well right now nothing because we haven't shared it with
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:59,712	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	At first I just thought he didn't want me to be able to play around with it but then I realize that and I don't even have a personal
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Copy for myself yet
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I said not even on the premises
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:06,880	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	No it's it's still very much contained to research

EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,480	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A video clip that has I don't know
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,296	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Bush or Barack Obama
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,320	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Saying things that
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	They have never
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:40,160	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yep this is right
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,208	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's it
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Uses game the thing is what his company does is not
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Quite the same as vocal
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	They do is like for a client node
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:52,704	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Create a voice that you can then just type in Word
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:55,264	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	They're sentences and make that voice say whatever you want
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:36:01,920	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I feel sad that's an interesting idea accents
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:04,224	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Variety of languages
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,832	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Internet spare time when they're not making voice
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	For clients
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:13,184	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Discover Donald Trump nigga I think they're building celebrities
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,744	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And it just so happens
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:18,560	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It got to Barack Obama and George Bush
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:22,656	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yeah how did you create a George Bush robot
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:24,448	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Well a great thing about
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:27,008	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	George Bush says he was president United States
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Sometimes morning
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:29,824	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Good morning which means
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:30,592	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	She had to give
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:34,688	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The weekly presidential address
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The other great thing about me dresses he's completely copyright
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,784	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Free summer Alliance
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To do anything we like that video
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	For the people of America
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Maybe things that they have envisaged that we got to do with it
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:47,232	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Real quick digression here just because it's absolutely fascinating
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:53,120	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It looks like we're actually about to enter this really sticky gray area when it comes to voice
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:56,192	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	If you record an audiobook
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And you sign over the rights
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To those audio files to the publisher
EDL	00:37:00,288	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The publisher has a copyright
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,128	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You you don't own it you do not own your own voice
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,920	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is that really true
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,456	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Anyway
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Back to Bush
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Lowe's weekly addresses
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,808	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	About 6 hours
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:15,904	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Which is a lot more tape invoke has 20 minutes but what you did with it is
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Pretty similar
EDL	00:37:16,672	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Right fed them into this machine learning algorithms along with their transcripts
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:27,168	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And then with the program will do I type the text and it will analyzing Sons it linger
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Twistix I will say this is the word Social Security social
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What's OSHA's made out of
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,824	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The sounds
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:35,360	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Oh
EDL	00:37:35,360	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And so
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,456	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Bootcut low sounds app
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:43,552	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Lots of little tiny pieces did that for all of the words
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	All of these addresses River Run 80000 in total
EDL	00:37:49,696	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Put them all in this database with tons of info about What song came before it after cetera and
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Once that database is built up all that's left to do I type in some text and then I put go with it trying to find
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:06,848	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Set of little sounds which will join together really nicely
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:10,176	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And then I push play and see how well they came out
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:17,600	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So what we did was we found an old video of former President George Bush and Barack Obama today
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:22,208	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Free shaking hands making generic statements
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,744	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Exactly is an import
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:25,280	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But we wondered
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Could we turn that clip
EDL	00:38:27,072	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	From a boring meet and greet
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To a scenario where bush is telling Obama a joke
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So we convinced a comedy writer Rachel axler who works for the show Veep
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,080	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Let's write a few jokes
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Optomap in
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,408	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is what the computers bad
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:42,944	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And well
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:44,480	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It goes something like
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Knock knock who's there
EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:51,392	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think it's something about the Oval Office probably
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That wasn't a very good joke
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The president
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	My wife Laura tells her better
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,936	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Wait what was that was terrible
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:10,336	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I told Nikki that was like where that I don't even get a I don't understand that joke at all
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's literally with the computer spot out
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:15,200	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That is what computer set out in
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:20,832	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Trippy. I don't think it anywhere it it did it is not worthy of the negative response that you are getting an error
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Let Live let me show you another one
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:25,952	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So happy to be joining forces with this good man
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:28,768	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But God is all in your drinking water
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:29,792	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Cortisol
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:31,072	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Cortisol to help protect
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,864	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	People cheat so they don't get fillings
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:34,656	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Isn't that alright
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,424	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	OSHA
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:36,960	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I think I signed the wrong bill
EDL	00:39:38,240	00:39:44,640	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	This is what you do chords
EDL	00:39:44,640	00:39:47,200	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The robots is massacred that is in itself
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:53,344	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But I do think it yet I'll let me get it while you two are far more critical than you should be and you are far more critical than the average Lyft
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	However
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Matt
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:00,000	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Conversation
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,792	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Getting people to set the
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:05,632	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	To talk back and forth to each other are still really difficult for it
EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:08,704	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Synthesizer
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:13,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I need a long time before we get really really easy conversation
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:17,408	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Human quality
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:20,736	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A tour to a conversation that that the synthesizers
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,016	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Can't quite capture
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:23,808	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But he also told us that
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:27,392	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You know if we at once we add the video or if we add a video to this
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,184	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It will smooth out a lot of
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	A lot of the prop
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:35,072	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	When you have to say she's as well speaking people not focusing me audio
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:37,120	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Coneheads of the iris in the same way
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:40,192	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:45,056	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Great great
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:46,080	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Two grad students
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:52,480	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	My name is James get title from the University of Southern California USC
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,528	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Also do a lot of facial reenactment
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Surgeon agreed to help
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Making these visuals also turned out to be way harder than we thought
EDL	00:41:01,696	00:41:07,584	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Turn off the clip we chose post some serious challenges there were too many side shots of Obama's
EDL	00:41:07,584	00:41:09,632	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Space at the lighting was all wrong
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:13,728	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And eventually I got an e-mail one late Sunday night saying
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It's not going to work
EDL	00:41:15,264	00:41:16,032	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Okay
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:18,336	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So now I think I can draw a line here
EDL	00:41:18,336	00:41:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And I can point out that this
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That we may be got over excited about this technology
EDL	00:41:23,456	00:41:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It is not yet ready for True deceit you have been fumbling and fumbling and fumbling here
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:36,256	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I have with them if they are you not the rug as people I find it interesting psychologically the timer
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:39,584	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I feel like it's a personal failure I don't like to fail
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,888	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You should
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:48,288	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So okay just just descansamos behalf on the behalf of extra trying to answer the question we fell
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:49,312	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Okay maybe
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Maybe
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:56,223	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We should try this one last time let's find a simpler Obama video and with the audio rather than
EDL	00:41:56,223	00:41:59,551	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Michael phrases let's just do a couple word Replacements here or there
EDL	00:41:59,551	00:42:01,855	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	By the way the only reason we're using Obama's annies
EDL	00:42:01,855	00:42:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	All these Technologies
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,159	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Is your belt around
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Play Sweet shows the video of Obama's last weekly address and which was the audio from a talk he'd given a
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:11,839	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Chicago
EDL	00:42:11,839	00:42:13,631	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	After he left office
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What's what's
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:22,847	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Nsvt Surah talks about what he's going to do next how he's still going to keep fighting for what he believes is right
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Build with
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:25,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Idealism
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,967	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	An absolutely certain that somehow I was going to
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:29,247	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The world
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:32,575	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	But what if he didn't
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:36,927	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	What if you could at that moment see the divisions ahead and he was just like
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:37,695	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	That's too much I guess
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:41,791	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The truth is we didn't think too hard about this
EDL	00:42:41,791	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	We didn't have much time we just whipped
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,375	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Together script based on words
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,143	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Used
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	You change it send it off to the guys at USC
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Vienna videotape myself saying this new script said that
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Use that video my face
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	The puppet eyes at
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	President
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:59,455	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And at when when we got the final video back
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I have to say it was
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:10,463	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I was expecting it to be horrible and we're to have a good laugh but
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,999	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	I
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	It went from like Laffy Taffy to
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Oh
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:17,119	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Wait this is

EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Tell the researchers
EDL	00:45:04,639	00:45:05,919	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Yes are you can't do that
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Sorry but you know I I know it's really cool I know you I know you probably are really proud of that algorithm but

EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:33,823	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Utilizing this
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	And developing it anyway
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	Weaponizing it
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:38,943	| radiolab_podcast17breakingnews |	So to speak
