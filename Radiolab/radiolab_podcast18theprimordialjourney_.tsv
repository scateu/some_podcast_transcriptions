EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	End
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:12,608	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We came up with this idea that beat
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Play me reporting only on reproduction for the next 10 years of Radiolab that what if we just put them all together in a series
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,776	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And so
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:22,336	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We're about to do that for the next month we're going to do the series
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And the name of the series is
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Gonads
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:38,720	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I know you're thinking why I would ask you a question you can say now what do you think about the work going
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Donuts
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's almost like that word moist
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Like a little
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:54,848	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes that word does have certain connotations what do you think of
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's a slang term for balls Falls festival
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:06,368	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Dumawall
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You just think like sweaty balls in mail jokes like kick you in the nap great
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Would you think it has anything to do with ladies
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,584	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	No no
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	No no no
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did you know that ladies actually have gonads also
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The gonads are both testes and ovaries
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,896	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It is actually for men and women
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,272	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Really I did not know that did not know that
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	90% of the people I talk to
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Didn't know that
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,720	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They didn't know it both have gonads
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,304	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Culture they stolen the word
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And I think it's time we reclaim this word like
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,888	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	As a citizen
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:52,192	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	As a human
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	As a lady
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	As a science lover
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I'm taking the word back
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:12,160	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Go home
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Okay so this is episode 1
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And this whole series like
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Kind of came into being
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	With a single phrase
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	All right the duck is in the house
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	From this guy

EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And I and I was 10 years old I would dinner
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Do you know looking to University
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sky Zone
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And trying to understand.
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Make make sense out of this whole thing
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What was it about the
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,519	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The sky that attracted you was the concept of infinity
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,311	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You know
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We're just
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Living a mundane life on this
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Planet without thinking of
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Anything but
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Routine that concerns but at the same time
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	America
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	This vast
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Space around us and most of you have no clue
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We live
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oblivious to that fact
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And I would lose
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,535	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sleepover that when I was
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,047	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Really
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Fast forward activate goes to medical school in Turkey he becomes a doctor specifically an OBGYN
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Silver a lot of babies
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Probably 20000 or so
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That's like birthing a small town after having read 20000 delivery I said
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yeah perhaps
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Stop
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,111	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	This is not my calling to be a little bit more
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	More towards the beginning of the process
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You know when you are an obstetrician you're dealing with the finished product right
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Why is think that's a crazy statement because most people think babies are the very beginning of the process
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I'm not sure what gets more beginning then like a small baby
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Hypnotic
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	A lady that feels like the starting line started something
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Scents that
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:48,831	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Most of the decisions most of something had already been decided by the time the baby gets out and that hole for
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Processes
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,391	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Fascinating
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To drag him into the studio to talk about
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Magical gonads basically just figure out why are they met
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I'm interested how you settled on that word
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yeah what did I say
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did I think Madrigal
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	For many reasons one is
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Their original aliens told me
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What he learned when he started studying this stuff
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We set the origin of the gonad like it's
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Creation
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Restorative the beginning
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:22,367	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Because it starts with this whole Saga that is so involved and so extreme
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did the baby itself does kind of feel like an afterthought
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:33,631	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	He calls it the Great Migration The Great Migration
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oxy got me into the story and so answer calling a bunch of people about it
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In my lab we have a slogan that says gonads or go home
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:41,823	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We have T-shirts
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You don't you do ever t-shirt
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That is Blanche Capel professor in cell biology at Duke University Medical Center
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	She eventually
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Studies
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,111	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	All the parts of the story we're about to tell you
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Okay so
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Place this story in time that begins at about
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oh
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Two or three weeks in humans I bet that's a day 24 just to be safe which basically means a sperm fertilized in
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	An egg
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	23 days ago could be petri dish
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It could be sax
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Who knows
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But inside this woman's uterus
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	His little organism that has been growing for 24 days
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What does embryo look like
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If I comrade-in-arms Pat Walters who's the editor of the series
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I don't know how to describe this
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:28,671	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Very well to you I could send you a picture because it kind of look like a tadpole
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Exactly that's not
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:34,303	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So wrong looks like a tadpole ever look at very early embryos like curled up
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	There's a tail there's like the the
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,447	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sort of ball of the embryo that's like
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Forming
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The developing body and then it has this like sweep
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Of a tail that's coming off
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If you zoom into the tail you'll see a little region it's called the Allen towis
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Call the Allentown
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Which is the trash bag of the Umbria
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:00,159	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Before the embryo has an X
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Excretory system
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It dumps
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Things that it doesn't want in the Allen Towing
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Urine flows in and out there
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,007	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So have a terrible place
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:20,895	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's like a foreign Planet this isn't actually part of the embryo itself now it's sort of in the hinterland
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Valentine was I always imagined was is
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:33,695	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Where Harrison Ford was camped out in Blade Runner 2049 which is like that fast
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:40,095	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Dust desert super orange dust yeah there's like
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Storms in end like winds blowing over the desert
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And it's here
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,359	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Where you find some cells
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	These very specialized cells germ cells a germ cell primordial
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	These are the sounds that are going to go on that Great Migration
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And put the magic
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In the gonads
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They are very interesting cell type there
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They're set aside
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Very early in embryogenesis and how many are there like
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,911	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's not that I think you're
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Something like 40 week that's it
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	40 biblical number and the irony here is is
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Besells sort of like huddled at the edges of this Wasteland
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Might actually be the most important cells in the body
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Because after the embryo grows
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	After the baby gets born
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	After that baby goes through puberty
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And one day maybe decides to have a kid these cells are present at the very beginning
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Vcel
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Iron charge
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I'm making a next generation of you that's the meaning of life right that's the origin of life these cells
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,823	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Everything else
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Are we think it's brain heart Etc but
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I think everything else
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:10:59,711	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is there
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,503	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The supports
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The survival of the germs
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:07,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They're the stem-cell of the species rights or stem cell means
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	A cell that can create other cells
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	An originator cell we have stem cells for long stem cells farts stem cells for neurons these cells are the only
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:20,191	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Cells that can make on their own all the other kind of cells that they can make a whole person
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So it's a
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They have a remarkable underlying
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pluripotency
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Do you think they know that well that's
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I mean that those are very difficult questions answered
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	No I think germ cells know they're really special cells
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:38,111	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But I don't think they know what they're going to become
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We can ask question if they're so special why do they start out in the trash
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yeah that seems like a bad place
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You would think
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Very curious at The Germ cells arise near that position and it's unclear why or
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You hide your most precious object in the trash
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:12:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Dumb as I got like the best Mission Impossible
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Like murder on the Orient Express. Maybe that's the plan I don't know
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In all seriousness
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	For some reason scientist
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Don't know exactly why it seems like evolution is decided to
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,231	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Giuseppe's sells a side at the beginning of development
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Which means I have to make a journey
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Back to the middle of the embryo where their Destinies will be revealed
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And if they make it there we make it there
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If they don't
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We don't
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Okay okay so so they hang around to Dusty Wasteland
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	For a few days old against the elements
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Imagine if I was in that situation I would just like to be wondering how I this was my lot in life to some sort of cause
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Cosmic joke
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Since I have a sense I may be important but I'm just here
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Don't know why is a wasteland
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Don't they hang out like that for a couple of days
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And then
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Place a call
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The hear call
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Baby smell call procedure there's a signal there called into action and so-so starting my grade
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:17,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They literally move wow what a wait so
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:23,583	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	How does a cell March they actually extend Philip odia which are Little Love cell like feet
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is it like it pops out to feet and then it goes walking self send out extensions
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And that extension has a little adhesion molecule on it like a little sticky
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Spot
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So when it puts his foot out it can pull the rest of the cell up to it
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,711	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They take a hike pike pike
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,087	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Bike
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,903	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And The Germ cells seem to be
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Holding hands like a long string of paper dolls
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And they touch each other
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,583	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Though they are
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The whole crowd is like going together and after a bit of a hike they get
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To the wall of the embryo just like I don't know if pulsating mass and somehow
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	This is a very blurry. I have to say they push their way through the wall
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,807	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And on the other side
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's just chaos there
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's like a foreign planets
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:28,607	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Because what's happening is I need this the embryo is just like dividing dividing dividing dividing dividing it.
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The whole embryo is developing very fast at this stage
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Trying to start forming Parts like once before
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oregon's wants to form a nervous system in all kinds of signals flying around to tell the got the form and to tell the liver.
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	For blood cells are popping up
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,039	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You know all these signals are flashing all around
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And yet The Germ cells their job is to block it all out
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:56,767	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They migrated right down the middle of the embryo
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	At the midline
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Almost like where you could think like a spine would be
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Through a forest of sickle
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Going around in the embryo
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And the signals are from farting
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,103	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Trying to tempt them like hey
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,895	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	B letter sound
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Believer South Combee liver B liver
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sometimes you sounds like
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I want to be a liver
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Am I a liver
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	No wait something tells me I should keep marching
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:31,583	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It seems scary doesn't it yeah they go through a battle
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Hey do you know if they ever lose one along the way like the chain is going and they're trying to like don't differentiate don't differentiate
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Just like the fourth one from the end ever going to become a stomach and then like oh crap
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Probably
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:51,551	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It happens
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But they try to stay focused
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Together and they try to resist
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,439	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	All of those signals that
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Could divert them from their destiny
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They want to say uncommitted
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,839	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	These might be the last
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,863	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Shells
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In the developing mammalian embryo
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,703	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To give up
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,263	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Their world of possibilities
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,055	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	This is David page
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	He is the director of the Whitehead Institute biologist
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did a mighty if you see what I'm saying so
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Basically when I want an egg
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is fertilized by a sperm
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:24,575	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To go back to the
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That beginning
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The resulting cell called a zygote
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,207	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The fertilized egg
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:32,255	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Has the possibility has the
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pencil to become every type of cell in the body
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And as
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	One cell becomes two and two become 4 and so on and so on
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Eventually some cells
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Give up that broad range of possibilities and become committed to narrower
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Occupations and specializations
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Are we have at least
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:57,343	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	200 or 300 specialized cell types that make up our body all the other cells
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Make the transition from possibility to reality
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And those migrating primordial germ cells are the last cells
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To give up a wide range of possibility
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,887	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	How I like them for their like
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pugnaciousness
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Okay we're getting back to the band of 40 we're back in the thick of things they're marching through the middle of the embryo
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Rio being like pelted internet fighting off all these other signals
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And they do this for one day
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	1 days
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	3 days
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	4
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I imagine they get tired as they go
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	6
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The signal that they're following is getting strong
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Longer
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,663	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And then pretty soon
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,223	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Over the Horizon
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I'm kind of either side of the
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They start to see
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	These mountains
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Urogenital Ridge is going to
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Emerge as sort of a mountain off the
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,071	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Back wall of the body cavity
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They're still marching down this path are following the Cigna
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Now the mountains are getting closer and closer
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And then it's some point the path in front of them
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It goes left and it goes to the right
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:37,183	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And half the cells will go to the left and half the cells will go to the right regardless of what direction they go in they end up at
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The base of a mountain
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,535	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In the mountain is a mass of
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Dense mass of cells
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And they come right up
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To the edge
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Of the mountain wall
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And they're able to just like
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Push those sell the side and like squeeze into the entire
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Carrier of the mountain
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,647	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Which is an entirely new space
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:15,327	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The Germ cells enter
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Enter the gungeon at
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,751	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oh this is the gonna yeah this is the place that will either be
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	An ovary or testis
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In which
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Has it been figured out which it is
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	At this point it could go either way
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,431	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I think about this place
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	As a cathedral
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,527	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And the cathedral
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,295	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Struction
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And as they walk in there they probably know immediately that this is the place that's been calling that because that's
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Signal that they've been following everywhere
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Maybe when I get to the gonad the whole cell is surrounded by the signal
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,959	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And that tells the cell to stop
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But this is just a guess what do you think it's like
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	For that for the germ cells like sure they've been going on this walk
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And then they get to a place that says
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Stay here so I wonder what the stay here like
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Kind of feels like I think it feels like home
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You're Marching for almost two solid weeks
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	We finally arrived
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They recognized
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,191	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	This is where they belong
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,823	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Everyone I talked to said probably still at this point
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They don't even know what lies ahead for
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Or even why they're there but why not
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	David page again
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I would suggest that the primordial germ cells
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They have been instruct
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	To migrate to the genital Ridge
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But they don't know why
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And they don't know what they're going to do
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	When they get there
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They have not a clue
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But the clue
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is coming

EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The tribe of 40 they find themselves in his Cathedral like space

EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But what happens is immediately when they enter they are surrounded by
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Somatic cells
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I imagine these cells as like friendly Monk
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Gliding around in red robes

EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That's kind of a hard question to answer because the general Ridge Head
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:37,728	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Started forming when the germ cells began their migration so don't really know is like
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,520	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What was sending the signal
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	After a few days some people say a few weeks
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The somatic cells that are gathered around the
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They reveal the destiny
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They tell them either one of two things
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:59,232	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You will become a sperm
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Or
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,632	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You will become
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Anime
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What exactly this box I was doing though
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I mean
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Make some changes lately
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Bumping them in some special way or releasing protein
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Well there are molecular

EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And what makes them go one way or the other
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:42,752	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That is super complicated and we're going to get into it later in the series so for now I'll just say and mammals
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,312	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sex is genetically controlled
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,592	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Bye
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Whether or not you have two X chromosomes or an X and A Y chromosome
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So she's basically like your fourth grade biology as if the cells in the cathedral have a y chromosome
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Though though say sperm and if the cells and Cathedral have an XX
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Chromosome Dulce
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,768	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Acted so busy just fate and luck
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Which way they go
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,072	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:08,352	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But here's the cool part
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If the monks tell the trim styles are there going to be
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sperm they basically divide a little bit and then the monks
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Take the germ cells and they put them to
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sleep disorders
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:23,968	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I don't know he's like catacombs until
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,248	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Afterbirth in puberty
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	But
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If the germ cells get told that there going to be a eggs
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Something different happens inside of them and they just
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,488	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Go
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:52,384	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	State divided they divide quite a lot
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,712	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Rapidly for a while and suddenly the band of 40 becomes
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,504	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Thousand in 2010
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Amongst men take each of these new eggs and embed them in the wall of the cathedral
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:06,976	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	/ / / /
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,744	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Boom
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They literally shove the eggs into the wall of the House of gonna
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,352	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And this goes on for months as a matter of fact
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The numbers
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:20,032	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Probably reach around 6 to 10 million
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	During the 5th month of pregnancy about 20 weeks
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Soca station
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That embryonic ovaries going to have all the eggs they will ever have when it's only 5 months along
EDL	00:26:30,272	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	With this is all still in uterus this is all I can uterus happen
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:37,952	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It has 10 million eggs and it is still itself months away from being born
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Theoretically at that point
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,328	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That is 500 times more
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Babies been acting a ever delivered in his career in this one developing embryo
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Just occurred to me
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:58,688	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	If you go all the way back to the beginning of the story you told a 24 whatever
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Everett was
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You got this little
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Organism forming Pi the mother doesn't even know it
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	There yet
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Already
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	There are the cells
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:11,232	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The in existence that will be
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,096	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Of the kid she doesn't even know she has yet
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So her grandkids
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Are in there already is that right so when your pregnant with a person you carry inside of you
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Cells
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That will make the next OU right it is Grandpa. It's like your grandkids are already inside of you inside of
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Your unborn child
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Child yes
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,552	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	That's been
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Yes
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Do you think the great grandkids are in there too
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:42,720	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Will it stick all that that's what she means by stem cell of the species
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Because
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's the same material that makes vayven
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They not only make the body they make more eggs
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's burnt they make the next generation of egg
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,008	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Sperm
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So they're still there
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So they're both making
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	A generation but then making the ability for that generation to make another generation
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,456	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Oh my God this is like
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:05,760	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So it is look like you're mad at its mirrors
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You're not only cradling like
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Your child your
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:11,648	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Cradling like infinite future
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Homosapien
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:13,952	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Wow
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	At the infinity
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's crazy that all that is there and you're not even a thing
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Did the first thought
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Thought
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The first thing that this organism has been programmed to do is not
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Hey make a make a person make a brain
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Make a life
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,336	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	No it's make more
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It's pretty gnarly
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:34,944	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	You know many many people believe that we exist just as a
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:39,296	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Harborfreight germ cells until we can make new people like we're just their host
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In some sense that's absolutely true I mean or as as was said a long time ago
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	A chicken
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Is an egg's way of making another egg
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,632	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I've never heard that before
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	At 2 I was in Michigan a couple of weeks in months ago
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It does in Michigan and
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:06,176	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I was
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,200	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Kayaking
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,272	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	On this river that has super Sandy Bottom that's a
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pretty shallow, looks like 3 or 4 ft deep
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,416	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And the cool thing was that it was Sam and responding
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Huge
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Finish they were like
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,024	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	324 ft
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	They were so stick around and and there were so many of them that they would like Russell my kayak
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And I see something
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,008	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Carnival is one part of the river like buy it
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:31,520	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Self
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:34,080	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And I look and it's
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:37,408	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Fish it's a salmon that's lying on the bottom of the
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	River
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	I see like through the Ripley Water I'm some like pink
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Turn the car around to go like look at it when I realize is the
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,440	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The pink is not like flash
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,232	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The pink is like
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Hacked eggs
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	The body was sliced open so you could see into the hollow
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,680	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	An in Halo We're just like
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:04,544	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	What felt like millions of these like Bubblegum
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pink drops of eggs like
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:08,128	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Higher body cavity

EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And to think that parts of our body male and female by the way because the the testes do this just
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,600	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Little later
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	In life
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,464	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Different parts of our body are like that fish
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Felt like just
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pulling back the curtain and
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Pink something that I I can never unsee

EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Before I go later in the series we're going to dig into sex ed and one of the things that comes up in
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Every conversation you have about sex ed is a book that somebody read to learn about the birds and the bees
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	It might have been given to them or they found it like in their library book sale
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	So we want to try and create an online sex as library with as many
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:54,880	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	Any of these books if we can find for all ages to go to radiolab.org sex ed
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:32:01,024	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And tell us about a book you got as a kid and the reason you loved it for didn't
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18theprimordialjourney_ |	And then we're going to add it to the shop
