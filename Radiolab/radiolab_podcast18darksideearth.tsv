EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,864	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	For some reason each other
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I really enjoyed your program
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Like we actually got initially contacted by NASA
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:57,664	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Dial in the mission control at a certain time and we did then they then connected us to him 200 miles up
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And we could see him
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Honor iPad

EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,600	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And so we spent
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I know like an hour the enchanted hour
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:12,000	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Talking to him asking him questions about what's it like
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,048	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The mostly looking over his
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,816	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Is shoulder

EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So they have on the spaceship
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	If it's a room with giant Windows looking right down at the ER
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Straight down
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Are we just passed over the southern edge of
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Australia
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:46,560	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	At that time it was night time in Australia
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Pool of black
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	No Contours
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,680	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	No edges
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:55,520	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I'll check to see how long it'll be before the sun shining earth below us
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Open up for the shutters
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Horizon
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He pointed
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Out the window at this band of light
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Did it just appear in the
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Cats with sun coming over horizon horizon the Earth
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:15,744	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Turn the blasted out in the school like a few minutes later
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,071	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Change really fast the Earth just lit up all the lights on.
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yeah cuz they're going 17,000 miles an hour when you're going that fast
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Sunrises basically instantaneous
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	As we were talking we zoomed over Australia over the Pacific
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	North America facts
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Within just
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Couple minutes felt like
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Scenery out his window went from Rocky Mountains to somewhere near New York
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Then we are over the Atlantic
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The interplay of the sun and the ocean is where I need to be
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Shimmering patterns on the ocean and
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Swirling Cloud masses
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And as we were screaming across the face of the Earth
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,207	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You know we're asking all these mundane questions like how do you eat rice in space and things like that
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	But at a certain point
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We asked him
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	When you first got up there what was most
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Surprising to you
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And he started talking about the Earth's
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Atmosphere
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I think you saw my first impression when I sat up here is that
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Neptune layer of atmosphere
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He says that it's
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:42,783	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Funny to him
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Now that he's been up there for
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,647	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	To understand how close we all are
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Two deep space
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,975	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	People who live on earth
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Parole action
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Under a very skinny protective wrapper
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,607	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It's been described as
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Less
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Thick than the skin of an apple around
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,239	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	All of us
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Just a few miles
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	From the dark
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It makes for some
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	States that mean
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,503	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Incredibly thin
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Intensely
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:28,863	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Very very isolated
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,383	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He says when he looks down at the Earth and he sees that
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Thin layer
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It separates us from space and all the Blackness around it
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He feels
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Protective
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:00,863	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Which going to share that because it was just this weird thing that happened to us randomly just a few weeks back
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Well actually
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	As cool as that was
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,727	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It's an order
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	To one another
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yes who wasn't delish
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,639	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Definitely

EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Silver final segment
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We would think through this show we thought you know who would have a really in
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,383	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Chrissy perspective

EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yep darkness is an interesting theme in space
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Because there is nowhere
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Where the
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Contrast between light and dark is any more extreme
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Davidson doesn't
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The space waxy says there have been times
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We sister out there floating in space next to
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The Craft
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And maybe the
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Tilt a little bit
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And wing
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Blocks light
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The Sun or the Moon
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And it creates a shadow
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He said the darkness
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	That shadow
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:42,911	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Is blacker than any black you thought it could be
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Now they're in Space the shadow has no light in it
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	There's not reflected light from dust in the air the Earth around you or clouds
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Pure app
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You can reach
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Into a shadow so deep
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So black
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,391	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	At your arm can appear to disappear
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,487	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Wow right in front of your face
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	When your head is in the bright light
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And your arm is in his
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Gaps of Darkness
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And she's gone like
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And cut off
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	But I do want to tell you
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	An experience I had
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You're my first
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Spacewalk
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Play 897 I have this
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,479	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Experience not gay
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It was from a Russian spacecraft
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Your mic might remember the mirror
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yeah sure face craft
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Today was up there he was
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The two Russian cosmonauts
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Kent and Anatoly soloviev
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	They were suited up
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And getting ready to make their first
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Walking to stay
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	For his first one
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,703	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And we did all the preparations
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,983	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	How to get the suits ready
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And more in the airlock
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:59,967	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Door open and they floated out we
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Flipkart others on outside he and entally gently float to the worksite
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And it was dark out and dark up in space means you're on the nights
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:19,167	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Side of the Earth in the shadow of the earth and there were no external lights on this phone
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Spacecraft this was really really dark and we were over the ocean and at night that basically means
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	She'll see the Earth you don't see it at all
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Not at all when it's up a moonless night you don't see the Earth in fact all it might look
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:44,767	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Look like to you is the absence of stars
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I want you to imagine Assuming he's up there in this darkness and the Earth with all of us
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What's on it somewhere Far Far Below him you can't see it
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:58,335	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	All the while and this is really important what happens next he is
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:04,735	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Shooting through space he's rocketing across the dark shadow of the Earth at 5 miles a second that is 6
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	15 *
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,063	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Speed the world moving right now cuz we are on the Earth
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He said that he didn't steal any of that it just felt like he was
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:18,815	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Bended in this Cocoon of black floating gently you thought no problem
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It was just me and the spacecraft and blackness
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And suddenly
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Blazing White
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:44,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Grafton from Below
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	At the Sunrise which normally happens here on Earth very very slowly calmly at that speed up there the Sun
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Screaming from the Eastern edge of the Earth straight across the Earth lights up everything is seconds
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:03,359	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Below me suddenly I can look down 200 miles and see that we're
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Removing at 5 miles per second
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:16,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I clutched Andres handrails like there's no tomorrow white-knuckled in my space suit gloves
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Because I suddenly had this enormous sense of height and speed
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Like if you're standing comfortably on the ground and and then some someone just flips on the lights suddenly and you realize
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Actually I'm not on the ground I am on a 400000 foot ladder
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Crazier still in that Sunrise moment the temperature also increase
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Reese's by upwards of 400° in the moment in the moment
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Stream thing I've ever heard are conditioned or whatever are you you are we are totally depend

EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	But the colors
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What you're seeing on that Earth
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:01,471	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Is so spectacular
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The greens and blues and the
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Delicate pastel light colors
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Contrast the brights
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Are you just are present
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Anything I've ever seen other than up in space
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	David is Russian buddy and totally
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	There after 4 hours
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Doing repairs on the ship so they are
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Is there speed they're going in and out and in and out of these days and nights
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So it's
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	90 minutes of a light dark cycle
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So you have 16 nights in 16 days
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Forever Yours day

EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,615	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	This change is happening over at
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Over and over every 45 minutes to go from blazing light to
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Quiet.
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Blazing light to dark
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Lost
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It will you get stories
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Of people doing spacewalks that lose their orientation or feel like they're falling
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So he says the only thing to do in that circumstance
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,055	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It's just a focus on your job look straight ahead

EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	That we performed live as part of Art in the dark tour in front of an audience about 2,500 people
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Where we left off
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,999	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Dave and his
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Cosmonaut
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Anatole
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	They had just been out in space
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,119	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Doing a space walk
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Repairing the
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Space Station
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And they're about to Come Back Inn
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So the two of them pull themselves by their tethers
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The comeback
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,615	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Into the airlock to go back in
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,151	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	When it was time to Come Back Inn
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:27,039	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	They couldn't get back at you were locked out of your spaceship you could call it locked out we
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We were trapped outside yes
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:32,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Essentially their airlock was busted if they couldn't repressurise
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,207	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	If you can't get it at the right pressure
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You can't win
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,791	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And we worked on it for for 5 hours and
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:41,887	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Ran out our resources and when second ran out of
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:46,239	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Oh yeah we oxygen or what plenty of oxygen it turns out
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Then what you run out of first
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,591	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Is your carbon dioxide scrubbing
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yeah unit
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Takes the CO2 out of your suit
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Another problem with this one is
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Usually
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	In space accident
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You figure it'll only hurt for a moment
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Back
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	When you die
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	CO2 intoxication
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:11,583	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	That drags out that's not a that's a that's a miserable way to go
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What it what does it mean did you ever find love
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What happens if first you get a headache
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Then your muscle starts at which eventually your heartbeat starts with
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Accelerate faster faster faster you go into convulsions and then you die
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,879	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Luckily
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:40,767	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The life-support system has an extra cartridge that gave us an extra 6 or so hours
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We used all that
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And trying to fix the hatch and we couldn't get it to hold air
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:48,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,495	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We were done
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,847	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Did you know you were done I mean you're pretty much
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And and over
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yeah yeah no more ideas
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Done like in debt
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So they decide okay we got to do something last dish maneuver if we can't get our usual airlocks work
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:21,215	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Maybe we can make a new one because he on the Mir space station is this big cylinder with these rectangular module
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	One of those modules is the airlock Jason once but you're normally just a living quarters
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Stop well if we can't get our usual airlock to pressurize the right pressure maybe we can go to the next one over
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And up next module in as a airlock
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	We open the hatch into that next modules and in order to go to go into it we had
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Had to disconnect the umbilicals
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:56,287	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Cuz you can't close a hatch over your umbilical right umbilical was providing our Cooling
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:20:00,383	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You are suits so as soon as we disconnect it
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Well that gives you maybe 5 8 minutes at Max before you before you what
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I won't talk about it
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It's so bad you did you did you look that up
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What happens if you boil
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Inside your spacesuit ugly way
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So they can actually think okay we've got to get through this tiny hatch into this room and they've got to do a fat
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	They also know if you struggle hard
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Go to fast you'll get much time at all in that suit before that heat builds up on you so thick
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,039	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Okay hurry hurry but slowly
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Hello
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	But I did not anticipate was as soon as we disconnected our umbilicals at the visor with fog up
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Now be having to feel your way of blind
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You can spit and kind of get a little area through the
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Fog
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So I'm in the airlock
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Trying to make my way into the next section
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And I was crawling along the wall moving into the next section
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And I Spit on my visor Rio to make a little hole to look through and get a hint
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:20,256	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And it was an area I had been sleeping in some weeks before and
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:26,656	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I left a picture of my family taped with Scotch tape on the wall
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:32,800	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And I Spit on visor and my helmet light went there and there was a picture of my family
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Right here in this moment
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:41,504	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	As I was scooting across the wall and in what was likely
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	My last minutes
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So this is how it's going to end
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So this is here
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And didn't look at so strange there they are
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:06,336	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Did I look back at that
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,360	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And I shudder
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:09,664	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Of course
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,456	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Dave and his partner
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Made it back in
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:12,736	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	YouTube space station
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Barely
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,856	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	But it didn't strike me really till months later
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	On the Earth
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Pow wow
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:23,232	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	How close a tab in
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,584	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And what a strange situation
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,400	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	This Russian guy must be your best friend like
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Gmail
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Well not many people been through anything like that together and and and are there to talk about it and
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	You just reminded me of something
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:49,088	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So we're going to leave you with one last story from Dave
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He's got a story she
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,768	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	This is from that same stay in space involves the same friend and a totally they were out there doing some work
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,072	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	On the ship and floating space again
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,632	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And then a mission control radios and
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,936	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Tell them to pause for a while we had
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:06,496	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	A period where we had to wait through the night
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:11,360	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	To go on with our work so he says up David uphill on Russian of course
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I want to show you something
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And we cooked our tethers on
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:18,528	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Pushed ourselves about 6 feet away with
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,320	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	What about 60 to tether
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,600	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So RI
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Couldn't see anything but out in space
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,816	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I turn my air conditioner down a little nipple is kind of warm
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And I was floating in this space suit just looking out
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Into the Blackness of space
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,336	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I felt like I didn't have a
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Space Unicorn
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	It was so comfortable
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,224	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	The air temperature was just right
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:55,648	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I felt like I was just out in the universe in the star
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	I couldn't see anything that stars are all around me I couldn't feel anything
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Outside of spacecraft going
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	5 miles per
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Second
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Universe
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,728	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Was that what he wanted to show you
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,776	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yeah I think so
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,848	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	This is his rocking chair on the front porch thing

EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He didn't want to talk he said let's just be
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:21,760	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Why it turn your helmet light off
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,320	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	So you don't get any reflected light
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,344	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Yes.
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Relax Riesling relax
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,840	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Relax
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Relax

EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	This is the moment where we gave everybody
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	Little pinpoint of light
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	A little hand-carried star
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,528	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	They could put over their heads
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	And weave together
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18darksideearth |	He was like this
