EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	You know can be defined as very alienating
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,495	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I mean it's not easy stuff
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	No
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	But instead of just writing off his ugly he was like
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:12,223	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Ugly how to turn in case just to skip forward a little bit in the music composer hour from Q2
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:14,271	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	John Luther Adams goes off to school
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	He has a teacher named I believe it
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:21,695	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	James Tenney one of his first big influences body goes off to school at calarts
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,743	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And right afterwards he meets one of his next
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,447	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I had just left calarts
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,239	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Haven't yet gone to Alaska
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,823	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I would take long
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,639	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Walks in the early morning and again at dusk
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And I became captivated by
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	This
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,807	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Singer that I kept hearing deep in the woods and I could never
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Find the bird box
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I couldn't get enough of the song
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I started taking notes
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	The birds became
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	My teachers
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:07,263	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	After James Tenney
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,615	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And the result was a series of
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:15,967	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Pieces that I composed between 1974 and 79
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Cold simply Songbird song
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,615	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	What
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:46,431	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Was the translation process between
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Hearing this Birds on that you just couldn't get enough of and constructing
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	A narrative
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,647	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	In working with the bird songs I just
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,463	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Try to take dictation I try to listen
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Carefully to the birds
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,327	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Where they are as they're singing
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And write down what I hear
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I'm not interested in
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Accuracy
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Because if I were I just
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,847	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Make a recording and play the recording
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:24,831	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I'm interested in what gets Lost in Translation because after all this is music this is perhaps a language
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	That we will never
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Understand
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:45,567	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Also there weren't very many field recordings available in those
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Those days but there were some and I decided no I'm not going to use them
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I really wanted to hear them and to learn them
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	For myself
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,319	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I was actually very different from the way I work
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Much of the time
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,647	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Rather than working with very specific
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,207	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Details of the music and then building
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:07,583	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	He's up I usually sculpt away the whole field of sound and I work with one
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Big

EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:17,055	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Color or atmosphere than that I have in mind that I can't quite hear but I want to hear
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Try to hear that since that
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Write that down as clearly as I can
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And then all the moment-to-moment details

EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,919	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And it gets kind of fed up
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I hated Los Angeles the whole time I was there I felt
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:03,135	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Lost and not in a good way
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:07,231	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It was such an interesting contrast because it was one of the most
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:11,071	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Closest periods of my life in terms of of discovery
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	But at the same time other was asking to enter knowing I just felt lost in the freeways and

EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,151	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Stands out and then you get out on the tundra and
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	You lose all sense of scale
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:48,415	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I remember one evening with a buddy we are so excited to be alive and out and that Arctic

EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And we saw this White Rock

EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,015	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	So we kept walking
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Suddenly stop
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,647	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Because

EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in

EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And the way that the lexham
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Has assertive and inherent
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,439	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Meaning to it
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Feels like falling
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Put some music of action pumping pumping tiptoeing
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Bonking all these things have been kind of musical expression that feels almost like a physical language that we came into the world
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,823	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	With never had to learn
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And when I went to music school
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,431	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It was so
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Difficult indents
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:00,319	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Because suddenly I was thrust into this world of contemporary classical composition
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It was all about
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Understanding
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	The rigorous
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Serial twelve-tone composition which is like you created in the mathematical systems that guide your choices
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I was like I don't know what the
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:14,655	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I don't understand this
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:18,495	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And then you hear it you like I might your can't pick up on it I feel lost
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	You feel like you're literally in the forest
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,079	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Then I
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I didn't count composers like John Luther Adams where it wasn't about that at all
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:33,855	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Selling a primal it's about like the movement of body see no masses of sound that serve crescendo-decrescendo.
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Waves I do think of the sounds of musical forms and events as
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,279	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Forces
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	As natural elements in some way
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	They may sounds ridiculously grandiose
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Or laughably naive
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	But I've always imagined that I might be able to work in a space that's
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,967	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Just outside of culture
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,015	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Course is patently absurd
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:04,831	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	There's no way that we work outside of a culture
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Police tase so many cultures
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And yet is my friend Barry Lopez the writer says landscape is the culture that contains all human call
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Vultures
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And I believe that everything
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	We do everything we think everything we think we create
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,079	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Who sing We Are The Rives
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:28,639	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	From the world we inhabit
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,687	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	R language
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:32,735	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Our music are our minds
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Everything is is shaped by
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Incredibly
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Complex and wondrous world that we inhabit
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:43,743	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	So ultimately this nature culture dichotomy
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	In a way doesn't exist
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	But it's been a useful conceit
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,983	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	For me to see all that I'm after something that that is
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:57,823	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It's not
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Part of the musical tradition
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:04,223	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It's not specifically cultural it's somehow more
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,503	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Elemental
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,159	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Where does music come from
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:17,023	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	How does a composer take an assignment like write an 11-minute piece for string quartet
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,607	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Translate those instructions into a concept into notes
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Into a score
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Free composer John Luther Adams it seems almost like the transformation happens in his sleep
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,335	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I try to resist
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Composing for as long as I can I really want to get it something
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Essential
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,503	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Before I start
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:39,295	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Manipulating notes
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Pushing things around
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:45,695	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I try to hold things in my mind ear as long as I can it's at its
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:51,327	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Maybe an inefficient way to work but it has worked for me
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I find that if I'm trying to remember
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Trying to hear something that I can't
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Quite
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,263	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Name it focuses my attention
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	In a certain way and then I finally
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:05,663	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Start composing when I can't not impose
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	When I have to write it down
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:14,367	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Thinking about like the way that we are discovering how memory and the brain works and every time you remember something you're actually recall
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Creating a story
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:22,560	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	So I really like that you have an idea and you are continually remembering it so basically you're making a lot of mental Xerox is a
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:27,680	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Yeah over and over again until it becomes something which is so steeped in your brain stuff
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	But it is
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:29,728	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It is a piece
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:30,496	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Exactly
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	So night after night
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,848	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	When I lie down to go to sleep I'm
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,896	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Imagining
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,664	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	This
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Group of
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Instruments
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,784	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	In this particular space in
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:43,552	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	What they might
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,344	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Sound like end
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,648	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	How they might move through the space
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:50,208	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Physically and through the musical space of
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:51,232	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	The peace
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,024	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And it's repetitive I'm doing it every night
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Certain point I lose it and I drift off
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:56,352	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	To sleep
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,312	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	That nocturnal composition process
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Is apparently what happened with John Luther Adams
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Most
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Recent most famous piece
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	The B-side I literally tried to copy
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	During a recent apocalyptical tour in the Pulitzer Prize
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:25,024	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Apparently John was spending some time near the Pacific Ocean and you would fall asleep to the sound of ocean waves
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,304	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Steeped in his dream
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And what emerged
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,144	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	We finally start to
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,168	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Compose was
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	This
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:36,800	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Orchestral piece for three orchestras actually it's called commotion
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,664	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	What happens in the pieces that over the course of about 40 minutes
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:42,688	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	All three orchestras
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:50,112	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Form these massive swells of sound like these three huge crescendos like massive tsunamis
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Crashing over you
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I'm talking about the title of a beast become ocean John Legend
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,872	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Adam said life on this Earth First emerged from the sea
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	The polar ice melts and sea levels rise we humans find ourselves facing the prospect
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,272	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It once again
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,552	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	We make quite literally
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Become ocean
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Well. In a conversation with wqxr is Helga Davis this is a global warming piece
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:06,912	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And I would say everything that I do these days is in some way
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:14,336	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Addressing the state of the world and the Delicate Sound of precarious position of we human Anna
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:15,360	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Animals in the world
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And yet I will also out of the other side of my mouth insist that it has absolutely nothing to do with
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	With current events or politics or activism and that music
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:28,672	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Must stand on its own as
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Music
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	And
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	I like to believe that we can have it both ways
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	She's very very Outdoors
EDL	00:24:54,528	00:24:56,576	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	It's without
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Like it doesn't have people in it at all
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	That's just
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,488	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Openness yeah yeah
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	You're floating on the surface
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,328	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	If you're there at all
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	One of the many reasons you should go to iTunes and download queue to meet the composer
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast14johnlutheradams |	Hour with John Luther Adams if they play this
