EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Elsewhere
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,032	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Similar right wing party start rising up in Italy Greece

EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,528	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And what
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,808	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Started off as
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	United States
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,672	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Impossible is now real
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:12,256	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Basically there's this wave of politicians whose message was
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,536	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	People and we listening to you
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Your government has failed you
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Trust me
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I would speak for people
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,912	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I'm going to fix everything
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And to Yasha this was
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know this is like a wake-up call
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And not just because of
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Immigration policy or right unless meanings of certain politicians
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:36,832	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But even more deeply than that I was quite worried about the way in which these political movement
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Perhaps pretended to have
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Some allegiance to democratic mechanisms
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But actually we were enemies.
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like there's this one guy the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,352	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Glorified
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Besides rice
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,632	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mission Valley Raceway
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Add Weehawken back to the country
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Fastest pass in a positive way
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That wasn't
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	DePauw fat
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I mean
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A huge number of the world's dictators have penal exit
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Democratic
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At some point
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,528	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And then they move against Democratic institutions in such a way that
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,064	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yukon displacement
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So for yahshua who made this point was a lecture at Harvard he
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:17,280	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know kept seeing this and Country after country after country he saw these
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Citizens
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Willingly electees wannabe dictators into power
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so she started wondering
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What is making the citizens do this
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Do they do they feel like their current leaders don't get them do they
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Are they already riled up about some issue of the day like refugees or income inequality
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Or
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is this a sign that they're upset
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	About something even more Foundation
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,719	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The prison system
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Itself
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like are they actually angry
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	With democracy itself
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Anti sat down with
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The friend and colleague
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To figure it out and it's Brenda turns out worked on something called the world values
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ambitious attempt to try and get a public
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Wikipedia around the world
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Basically just a bunch of social scientist who asked a whole bunch of very standard questions
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To a whole bunch of people all over the world
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What's actually look scrutinize what
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What's the setting hear about your mockery
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And when we actually
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Look at the numbers
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You're honestly flabbergasted
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay so
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Exactly three questions in particular
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That he got interested in poker
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Start with
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	How do you feel about a strong ruler
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who doesn't have to bother with
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Parliament
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who doesn't have to bother with Parliament or election
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,343	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yep okay
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They also asked this of Americans just instead of doesn't have to bother with
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Parliament it was does not to bother with Congress
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So in 1995
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	24% of all Americans
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Endorsed
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That kind of strongman leader
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	24 / so you know one out of every four
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah but in the last several years that number is jump from 24
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	232 purse
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So now it's a third almost
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That sucks
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Say it strong leader who doesn't have to deal with Congress or elections
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,319	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Either a very good or fairly good
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Well that's surprising
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:24,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's it's kind of even more striking in Europe so is it in Germany
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	One in six people
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:29,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Used to like that idea but now I'm free

EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Misguided
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Or tragic
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:58,111	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I don't know which said something he was like I didn't think of a cuddles to go there tomorrow

EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A deep lack of attachment to a control system and visit of sense of
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know what
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,423	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I mean try something
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	How backflip
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You must watch the movie
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Here's the here's the thing that gets to be
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Let's imagine
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:24,991	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A well-intentioned but totally authoritarian dictator
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who takes over gets used to
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Power and then
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	As dictators do chooses
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is to remain in place
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Forever
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The adventure of democracy
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,743	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is it admit
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,535	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That nothing is ever right
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We always have to fix it and the system
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Has built in it
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Impermanence
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Every
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	6 years you are
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The senator over again every two years you will like
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:55,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The congressman over again every 4 years you can have the option to switch presidents presidents can't serve Beyond a particular
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It will be checked
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They will be balanced as they will be protection but the whole thing
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,319	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Admit
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,367	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But there's always change
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,903	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And always the ability
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And this trip that you just read me says we don't believe in it anymore that's dangerous to me
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Scary to me I think my response is if that's the case and I don't argue
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Happy people happy zipping
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,495	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If that's the case then let's fix it
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Let's not throw it out
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,079	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Let's repair it in some way
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But that's what seems like a moment like this called
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Basically you're saying
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Let's fix it
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:33,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah well
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,231	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Eminem is theirs
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Corporate money and
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Special interest lobbyist and gerrymandering and minority groups don't get a voice and active voter suppression in a lot of
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Places the weirdest of the Electoral College to two-party system in general where it seems like they have nothing to do except for haitani
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Each other but the thing is
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:01,247	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So just focusing like
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I take this very specific week this week that we are talking about this there is a midterm election coming up
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so I figured let's like let's just focus on one thing
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,255	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Baoding
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like is there a way to just
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Weakness
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Fundamental part of democracy like can we change the way we vote
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Svet people don't
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Feel as many people now do that they're throwing their vote away that they did their vote doesn't count that their vote
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is wasted
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay so
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,087	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What would you
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You suggest
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What I got is a
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Kind of an alternate universe it's it's
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's a different way of doing elections
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Vet
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Could have
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Founder effect on the way or tomorrow
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Eddie can you hear me
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yes there we are good
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay cool and we're going to start off with producer Simon Adler
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah so in search of democratic inspiration
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I called across the ocean to the Emerald Isle to talk to this
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So my name is ABC open Bowman
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:11,903	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Attorney work for orgy radio one on the DriveTime program is a radio producer reporter for Ireland
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Equivalent to the BBC known as RTE
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Eddie's a self-described election nerd
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay so
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,839	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Just wanna start from the start the way I would look at this is
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	American democracy is
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	One of the oldest democracies in the world it kind of like a laptop from 1985 at the time every
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Everybody was like oh my God this is incredible it's so fast it's so responsive units so much stuff done with this
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,967	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You did
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But you've got to keep updating your operating system otherwise pretty soon your democracy is struggling to deal with things like
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Facebook news feed on Twitter and leave the cell phones being hacked by Russia
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,535	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In Ireland we got our democracy little bit later
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The 1920s
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay and I thought Point democracy had moved on from
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The 1770s 1780s when you guys are boring your democracy

EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	21
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,952	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	20 Honda first off the bar at the end of the first
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	First and second are pretty much locked down with the two people everybody expected to it
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,608	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In third place
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Unexpectedly is Mary Fitzpatrick
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,984	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To be in third position on the
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	First time
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Now with our system of voting at this point
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You're done
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The election's over
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To Frontrunner candidates would have each won a seat and then Mary Fitzpatrick
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Wouldn't want to see
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,808	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary and Maureen baby out
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Done but
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,136	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In Ireland not so
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In Ireland
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,440	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They're just getting started
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So back to the race
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,792	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And remember at this moment
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,888	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mary Fitzpatrick is in 3rd Gary is in 5th and in 7th
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At that stage I was listening to the radio and I knew what they were saying about Dublin Center
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is incumbent Mourinho cell
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And it appears almost certain to
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Joe Costello and Maureen O'Sullivan are set to lose at
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I had some
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Because of the numbers I think the feeling was I was too far down that first preference
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:08,928	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To come back
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:13,536	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But I've been looking at the early results coming in from around the country like I said
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's not over yet so the way the most Progressive
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The sheriff are the presiding officer
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,424	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Start to eliminate
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Candidate the first elimination
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is the bottom three candidates
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Those candidacies are gone and in the band
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:29,408	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Since Gary's in fifth and Marines in 7th are safe
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,432	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	For now
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,480	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But the bottom three candidates
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,248	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They're gone
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:38,368	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Y3 because they are so far out that mathematically they could never
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Come back
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:42,464	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Between the three of them they've only got like a hundred fifty
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So we get rid of all three of them and redistribute those
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So if you voted for those people they just go okay
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who did you vote for as your second
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,192	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The point is your vote is still alive and still part of the select
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,336	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Enso

EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,752	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Stacks for every candidate that was listed as a second
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:32,384	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And we distribute them they take them back to the Cubby where they are then added to the remaining candidates

EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Should maybe be participating in letting somebody to go out
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Exactly
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:51,840	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Alright what time is it now we're probably middle of the afternoon at this
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,864	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	MLB start
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,400	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We started at 9 in the morning
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:59,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Point taken people are hacking by doing no no no no
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:02,592	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I'm not watching this program for 5 hours
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is that a long time I will challenge your statement that just because a competition
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Unfold
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Slowly
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,784	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That it is without
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,320	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Drama
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Or suspense
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All right
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,160	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I'm sorry that we making this so hard for you
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:18,720	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's fine if you are not making it easy for us
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:24,096	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Anyway back to the scene has reduced to three seats
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,632	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So I'm looking at this going okay
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:28,448	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mary Patrick Star candidate in 3rd after
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The first count has 2500 votes
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:33,824	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary Gannon / Liane V behind her
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And my instinct is he's going to be more transfer friendly he's going to get more second choice votes than her
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,736	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I think you could ever take her
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:43,296	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Am I start watching where the transfer to going
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:44,320	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I start to be proven rice
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:59,168	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Knife pocket only getting two countries the whole process repeats knock somebody out to the ballet ballet redistribute
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,216	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Transfers Gary gulman pics of 60 votes
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And I could possibly pick up stuff so he's gaining on her already to talk about me asking who is this going where is he going from
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All these things and then look at my phone call Mary stock is falling well Gary their right is that Mary stuck is saying stop
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know we were struggling to transfer stuff that was the issue
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,136	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And the others are gaining on
EDL	00:30:20,160	00:30:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It painting
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Undermined you still got other people taking up both their little pickups
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:33,472	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Nautilus for moving ahead slowly
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hounds, you have for again
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:40,384	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The time around really not much changes

EDL	00:30:41,920	00:30:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The next person going I just got a hundred bucks
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:50,624	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	31 of them but Maddie Fitzpatrick but also 190 of them go to go to Gary Gannon
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,696	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All the people in his ability to pick up transfers from
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:54,464	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary gulman
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,488	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Jumped into fourth place
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We got quite a fight now in her hands B standings as they are still at the place of Mary Fitzpatrick in third place
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Just barely holding on in 4th
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hot on her heels is Gary Gannon and then way at the back of the pack still in 7th is incumbent Maureen O'Sullivan
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:14,688	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Play it had five or six

EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's over the line and also
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary Gano jumps into third place it was pushing Mary Fitzpatrick out of a winning spot
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,920	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It was on the transfers I got cost never recaptured
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The woman who under our system would have worn off the bat
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:51,552	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Cheap locked out
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yellow
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:32:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Still hanging on in second-to-last but but also disheartened is our incumbent Mourinho cell
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:05,120	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who's expecting to
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And I suppose maybe seven
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,472	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	People started to arrive

EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,104	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	For a concession
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,408	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And I said when people came in

EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Proportional representation by single transferable vote
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,112	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Working out
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:46,720	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Exactly as it is meant to or is this sort of a pro version of the Sith
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	No it absolutely is it woke that they will tell you exactly a single transferable vote was meant to do
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:54,400	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	One Last Time be gracious Gary
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Everybody got their cut everybody got their saying everybody got their vote don't get me wrong
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It is
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:06,432	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	2829 Dan Lake of the u.s. sense of like
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:06,944	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Will show you
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Lego movie back
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:09,760	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Single transferable vote on. They work against me
EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Reno
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,624	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I think it worked out perfectly
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Perfectly
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:20,768	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I mean let me just see if I get this right
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	There's this woman
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:23,840	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maureen
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:25,120	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hardly anybody loves she's hot
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,728	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Scores almost no
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,264	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Boots at the favor
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	She's just everybody's beer
EDL	00:37:33,568	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	No AA 4th 5th 6th I'll choose
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Marine
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:41,760	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And yet because the votes to keep getting shuffled and shoveled and shoveled
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:43,552	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's missing that who becomes
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:44,832	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The winner
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,648	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But she's she's chosen because a lot of people
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Don't
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Heater
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,976	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah what's up
EDL	00:37:51,744	00:37:54,048	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Here's what it makes me think
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,864	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Right and I had this moment where I was just
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,632	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Imagining
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If we had been using this at various
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:02,240	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Crucial moments in our
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Very recent history
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Things could have gone an entirely different way
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Take the American presidential election of 2016
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay between Hillary and Donald Trump
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:14,272	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hillary Clinton but also
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:17,856	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary Johnson and Jill Stein
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hardly hardly anybody that number of hardly anybody
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That was that's a sizable enough number
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:26,816	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That they
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:30,144	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Could have swung the election one way or the other if you look at
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,168	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Veliki state
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The deciding States
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:34,752	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If you presume
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:40,896	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Gary Johnson votes were split and if you presume all of Jill Stein votes went to Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton would have
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Pennsylvania
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Michigan
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,992	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And Wisconsin
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And the whole kitten Kaboodle
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Well that's
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Interesting
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Another weird thing is you can just keep playing this game and and it'll drive you crazy but you can keep playing until if you go back to
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:39:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	2016 Republican primaries where Donald Trump emerged
EDL	00:39:00,096	00:39:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Victorious right over 10 people or something
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Over 10 people
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:07,776	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But there was a sizable number of people in those primaries
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,056	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Two word never Trumper
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If those people had been able to block their votes together they might have been able to
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:18,272	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Rally behind a candidate who is not
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Donald Trump
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It and then rewind even further back
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The 2000 election where
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:29,024	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The number of books that Ralph Nader. In Florida more than the difference between Bush got and Gore got no elected elect
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:29,792	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The Republic
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Can you okay so it's so go back
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:33,120	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To rust
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Wright's George HW Bush was running against Bill Clinton in 1992
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ross Perot it's
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:43,616	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Very controversial whether he really was a spoiler in that election but
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I mean if you ask them to Bush People they say definitely was
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If the perimeters went to Bush's that been
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:54,112	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like Bill Clinton would have just being a historical footnote he wouldn't have being the president
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:55,136	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like it's like a
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Huge
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Huge seismic difference in
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,720	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In world history
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,608	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	When we come back
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:09,984	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We're not going to be looking at my own imaginative math we're going to look at what is ranked choice
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,264	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Actually look like
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It was in the United States
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Because it is in the United
EDL	00:40:14,592	00:40:15,872	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's about to happen
EDL	00:40:16,384	00:40:17,152	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	When we come back

EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Talking about this and thinking about this around the office for
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	For a little while
EDL	00:40:56,064	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At some point as we were as we were
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:02,720	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Become meditating on this dwindling faith in democracy one of our

EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:15,008	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We've been having this
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Conversation about
EDL	00:41:17,056	00:41:19,872	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Whether our democracy is broken for like a
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:21,152	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A few months now and like
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:24,480	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Every meeting that we've had I've been the one in the room being like
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:28,576	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Guys are democracies finally have you seen other places
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:31,136	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This is crazy like who are these people that
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Think like
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Our democracy is broken like they don't know what
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They're talking about and you know why I like where where where is that feeling coming from
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Well okay can you tell me your name
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:50,080	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And who are you probably because of this woman I was
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:54,175	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I was over you in relation to me
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Oh I'm your mom my mom is
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And both of my parents actually
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Grew up in Pakistan that is the
EDL	00:42:01,599	00:42:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Fixing 25 years of my life that I spent and I
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Field which is
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:09,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A pretty young country and its
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:11,071	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's just struggled so
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:12,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Much too
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Keep its democracy alive and healthy
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I saw and the consequences of
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:24,127	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Not getting the full demo democracy
EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,431	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	There in Pakistan
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Soda
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That then after living 25 years of next 25 years of my life in America
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:35,391	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I really found out the value
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Off for democracy
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	As an individual and as a group also
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:42,815	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So that I can differentiate now
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:44,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maryville
EDL	00:42:44,607	00:42:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Getting to the store
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:47,679	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:51,007	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's kind of how I've always understood our
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Button Simon I listened to your Ireland story with
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:57,151	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All of the
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Does ranked-choice voting stuff in and that's the first moment when I was like
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like maybe
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maybe our way of doing things is
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Broken leg
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maybe we do need a nap
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay okay
EDL	00:43:13,279	00:43:14,047	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What about it
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Make made you
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Switch teams
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Because
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maybe suddenly aware of the fact that in our system Candice
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:24,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Don't
EDL	00:43:25,311	00:43:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Actually need a majority of the votes to win
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You have canvas who then make that calculation where they say
EDL	00:43:33,247	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I only really have to win the votes
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	People who are in my base
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If that's
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If those if my base is bigger than everybody else's base
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:44,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Then like screw everyone else
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:47,583	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It is seems like in a democracy
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	People should vote for the
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Person who win
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Not just that the person who wins is going to have the biggest
EDL	00:43:54,239	00:43:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Bass
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:57,567	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Bigger base that everybody else
EDL	00:43:57,567	00:44:01,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like it should be that most people are in some way and some preference
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:02,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Supporting the first in Utah
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah exactly and it's funny like
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	When I heard about ranked-choice voting I was like
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Oh like this system is so cool because it
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:16,255	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I feel like it addresses that exact
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Problem
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so I totally got sucked into it and I
EDL	00:44:20,351	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I started looking around
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:26,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And it turns out there are a bunch of people who think that this
EDL	00:44:26,751	00:44:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Could be used here in the US
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And not only that it already is
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And when I asked around
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A number of people appointed to this moment in
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mm with the election when
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:42,623	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Bush loses the popular election but he wins
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,415	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Because he wins in Florida
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so people look at the the results in Florida and see that
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A bunch of votes that
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:52,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Might have gone to Al Gore
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They go instead to Ralph Nader
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who then becomes
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know sort of notorious as the spoiler that
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That maybe
EDL	00:45:00,799	00:45:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ruin the election
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Infer Al Gore
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And after 2000 at that point you do see some cities that
EDL	00:45:06,943	00:45:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Start to adopt ranked-choice voting
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:09,503	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At the local level
EDL	00:45:10,015	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so what I did is
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	My phone
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I grabbed let this and we kind of did this
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Cross country ranch Choice voting tour
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,327	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	End
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The first place we're going to start with
EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Hello San Francisco
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is San Francisco

EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,311	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yes this is Dominic what's up
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:33,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What's up
EDL	00:45:34,335	00:45:35,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So this is
EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:37,663	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Dominic fracassa
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	He used to do radio pipes for it Dominic hey let me know if you need me add spot
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So we can get right to it
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But he order at the San Francisco Chronicle
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:51,487	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	City Hall reporter for the chronicle
EDL	00:45:52,255	00:45:55,327	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah so the very first ranked-choice election in Sanford
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Francisco happened in 2000
EDL	00:45:57,887	00:46:00,703	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But it was actually a ranked-choice voting became
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:03,519	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I guess the cities method or the city
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:07,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	System if you will back in 2002 where there was a a ballot and it
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:09,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's that was passed by voters
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That said like this is going to be the system that that we're going to implement going forward
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:17,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So the vast majority of local elected office
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,903	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is are are chosen with with ranked
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So city council supervisor

EDL	00:46:30,399	00:46:30,911	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In the mayor's race
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:32,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The case
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In the mirror
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay great
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I can't believe this was just that a few months ago
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:39,103	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It seems like a long time ago
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay so early 2018
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:44,479	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The San Francisco mayor's race
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Kicked off
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:47,551	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And when it really kicked into gear if there were
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:48,319	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Three leading
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:50,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You had

EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Former San Francisco supervisor Mark Leno
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And you had
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:07,263	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A current supervisor I Jane Kim
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:09,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And these aren't these are all Democrats
EDL	00:47:10,591	00:47:11,359	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The field of candidates
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Set down
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:16,223	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:20,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So out of the gate San Francisco
EDL	00:47:20,575	00:47:21,343	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	London breed
EDL	00:47:21,343	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This camp
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Pain
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:24,415	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is a winning campaign
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:26,975	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	He was the more moderate more established Kansas
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	She's getting one heck of a bounce in the polls
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:35,423	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And she had a fairly strong lead in a lot of wind in her sails
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:36,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The closest rival
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mark Leno
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And as a campaign has made its way to election day
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,103	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We are winners
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It was almost like
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Sure there are three names on the ballot
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:50,015	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But today was more like London breed London breed
EDL	00:47:50,015	00:47:51,039	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And London breed
EDL	00:47:51,039	00:47:53,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The favorite in the recent polls heading into
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Tuesday's election
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:55,647	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But then
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Right before the election
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:02,815	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Something happened that you basically never see
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In American politics
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Never believe that
EDL	00:48:15,615	00:48:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In the very last few weeks
EDL	00:48:17,663	00:48:18,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Before election day
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The two underdogs Jane Kim and Mark Leno
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:25,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They held a press conference on the steps of City Hall
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mark and I are
EDL	00:48:28,927	00:48:32,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They stood outside City Hall literally join hands and said
EDL	00:48:40,191	00:48:40,703	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Porter
EDL	00:48:44,031	00:48:44,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Wait a second
EDL	00:48:45,567	00:48:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So what you think of me but also vote for
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:51,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Guilin running again
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Vote for me first
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,319	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Vote for James II
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,855	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Vote for me first and vote for marks
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So like if one of us were to come in last
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like what they Mark comes in
EDL	00:49:02,975	00:49:07,071	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If all the people who voted for him ranked Jane as their second choice
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,863	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Then all those votes would go to her
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:10,399	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And vice versa
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:11,935	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That way
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They actually have a better chance
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Of beating the front runner
EDL	00:49:15,519	00:49:16,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	London breed
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:17,567	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And that made it
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:20,383	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A lot of sense they were both quote-unquote more Progressive
EDL	00:49:20,383	00:49:21,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If candidates and you know
EDL	00:49:21,919	00:49:24,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Saw each other at least the rhetoric goes
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:25,503	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Add
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The person that they'd like to
EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	To see as marriage
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:28,575	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If not them still
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Was that was that a surprise move to you as you were covering it did you see that coming
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,231	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	No I think that was it
EDL	00:49:35,743	00:49:36,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A surprise to a lot of
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:42,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Supporting both
EDL	00:49:43,423	00:49:43,935	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Jim and Mark
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Vermeer
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	After that press conference
EDL	00:49:47,775	00:49:48,799	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Jane Kim

EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The race would actually drag on for days as more ballots get counted
EDL	00:52:09,599	00:52:11,391	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Thousands of outstanding balance
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We didn't have a mare chosen until I think eight days later
EDL	00:52:15,743	00:52:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	When in a gymnasium packets
EDL	00:52:21,119	00:52:21,887	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Screaming supporters
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:23,167	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Outlet

EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yes
EDL	00:52:29,055	00:52:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Mark Leno came up
EDL	00:52:33,663	00:52:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Chester
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	He came within 1.1% or a
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A little over 2500 votes
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Oh man
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So I mean
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:44,927	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Okay it didn't work in that he didn't win but you can't say that it was
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is completely ineffective
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:50,047	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And so so ultimately what did people think of
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This hole like Mark
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Leonard Gene Kim coming together
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Strategy as
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:57,471	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Xgaming the
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:52:59,007	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	As saying look
EDL	00:52:59,519	00:53:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They are doing this
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In order to keep London breed
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And that would never got your paper right
EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Right that was that at
EDL	00:53:10,527	00:53:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I mean people do feel that
EDL	00:53:12,575	00:53:13,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That it was this
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:14,367	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Strategy
EDL	00:53:14,367	00:53:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Especially when
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	42 *
EDL	00:53:16,415	00:53:20,767	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Who saw a teaming up a piling on and in this I mean just to kind of
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Zoom out all the way I think people just
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Find that weird in
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:26,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A country
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In which
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Politics ends up being a
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A zero-sum game
EDL	00:53:31,007	00:53:33,567	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In which you are you know relentlessly
EDL	00:53:33,567	00:53:34,079	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We attacking you
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Bloodsport

EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:39,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But
EDL	00:53:39,711	00:53:42,271	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At the same time that's very much
EDL	00:53:43,295	00:53:45,087	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Either might be some people at my own newspaper that.
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:46,367	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Disagree with me but I think that's
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:47,647	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Very much in the
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:50,719	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Spirit of what rank Choice voting invites
EDL	00:53:51,487	00:53:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Coalition-building
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:55,839	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Dominic wanted to be clear the
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:53:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In the case of the mayor's race
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This coming together of opponent
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I don't want to make it sound like it was just some kind of Kumbaya.
EDL	00:54:03,263	00:54:04,287	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know because that rude that was
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But
EDL	00:54:06,591	00:54:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At the very next stop on Archer

EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That goes that if you're hoping to get like second and third choice votes
EDL	00:56:07,679	00:56:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You'll be much nicer to your opponent so you don't alienate their supporters so maybe you get a second or third choice vote
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:15,103	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And it did seem
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:15,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like
EDL	00:56:16,127	00:56:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	There is an element of that playing out
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:20,223	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I'm in in the race
EDL	00:56:20,223	00:56:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I will
EDL	00:56:21,247	00:56:22,271	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Talk more about
EDL	00:56:22,271	00:56:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All the issue
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Cuz I think I've run out of
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:26,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Thank you at work there was like
EDL	00:56:26,879	00:56:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Some light ribbing
EDL	00:56:30,975	00:56:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Tencent
EDL	00:56:33,279	00:56:34,303	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	They were polite
EDL	00:56:34,303	00:56:35,327	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Stage Logistics
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Getting out of that chair is a little challenging
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So we may want to
EDL	00:56:39,167	00:56:40,191	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The microphone around
EDL	00:56:40,959	00:56:41,983	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And
EDL	00:56:44,031	00:56:44,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Plenty of
EDL	00:56:45,311	00:56:45,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:56:46,335	00:56:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The most remarkable one of all
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:49,663	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What's the final two
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I was there and it was in it
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Church in Downtown Minneapolis with the church was
EDL	00:56:59,135	00:57:00,159	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And at the
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:01,695	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The end of the debate
EDL	00:57:02,463	00:57:04,511	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The candidates and I think there were eight of them
EDL	00:57:04,511	00:57:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	All
EDL	00:57:05,535	00:57:11,935	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Kind of put their arms around each other and one of them suggested that they all sing timer but I am I was
EDL	00:57:11,935	00:57:18,079	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Kumbaya
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	No
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:26,783	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	After the debate after the debate
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:37,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's going on Instagram
EDL	00:57:49,823	00:57:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So it's like I mean it's almost like a cartoon right like the Kumbaya it's really
EDL	00:57:53,919	00:57:54,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Funny
EDL	00:57:54,687	00:57:55,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Right but it's also
EDL	00:57:56,223	00:57:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's
EDL	00:57:57,247	00:57:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It's also I think for a lot of people right now that
EDL	00:58:00,319	00:58:01,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Feels like a relief
EDL	00:58:01,599	00:58:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If you'll take a relief to hear politicians not biting each other
EDL	00:58:04,927	00:58:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Heads off
EDL	00:58:05,951	00:58:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And that
EDL	00:58:06,975	00:58:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's something that comes from ranked-choice voting you fine
EDL	00:58:10,047	00:58:12,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Consensus you find Coalition you find
EDL	00:58:13,119	00:58:13,887	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Commonalities
EDL	00:58:13,887	00:58:14,399	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Difference
EDL	00:58:16,191	00:58:16,959	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	But
EDL	00:58:16,959	00:58:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That also
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:21,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Flattens everyone out if everyone ends up running to the middle
EDL	00:58:22,335	00:58:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And then you just
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:24,383	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Have kind of a
EDL	00:58:24,895	00:58:26,943	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	A bland consensus
EDL	00:58:26,943	00:58:29,503	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yes or no one's saying bold things
EDL	00:58:29,503	00:58:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And everybody is just
EDL	00:58:31,295	00:58:31,807	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Kind of
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:33,599	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Middle
EDL	00:58:33,599	00:58:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	So in a way when you make this Choice your choosing
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:38,719	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	4
EDL	00:58:38,719	00:58:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Do this carefully
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:42,303	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What is careful
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I wondered about that cuz I'm thinking maybe don't do this carefully
EDL	00:58:45,631	00:58:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maybe have a country that can be dynamic level right now
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah
EDL	00:58:51,263	00:58:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We are that is in deep in a deep way that's what's being asked him like what do we
EDL	00:58:57,407	00:58:58,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What do we actually want
EDL	00:58:58,687	00:59:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Do we want a system where
EDL	00:59:01,759	00:59:08,159	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You know you are lined up behind your Alpha Dog who's going to who's going to argue for all of the things you want
EDL	00:59:08,159	00:59:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Want an end and maybe you can get them but maybe you're also going to lose them all or
EDL	00:59:13,279	00:59:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Or do you want it do you know being a system where you know your
EDL	00:59:17,631	00:59:18,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We're all kind of
EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Started begrudgingly bought into
EDL	00:59:22,239	00:59:26,335	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Irr second-place person who get behind but like
EDL	00:59:26,335	00:59:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Definitely wasn't
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	He knows how to write deal and I think that's a question
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:32,735	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That's like a soul-searching kind of a question
EDL	00:59:32,735	00:59:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Michael what do you want and what we want this country to be and for that reason
EDL	00:59:37,343	00:59:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like I don't know how I feel
EDL	00:59:38,879	00:59:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Just going to be perfect I think it's really interesting is what seemed sort of mechanical
EDL	00:59:44,767	00:59:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And
EDL	00:59:46,815	00:59:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Technical
EDL	00:59:48,095	00:59:48,607	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It does
EDL	00:59:49,375	00:59:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The tone
EDL	00:59:50,911	00:59:53,983	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Your country and history so the world we've got is the function
EDL	00:59:53,983	00:59:54,495	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	How we vote
EDL	00:59:55,263	00:59:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Change this
EDL	00:59:56,031	00:59:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	System.of always vote
EDL	00:59:57,055	00:59:58,079	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Can I get a very different world
EDL	00:59:58,591	01:00:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What different what different we're different food China different scary different good different
EDL	01:00:03,199	01:00:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	You don't know
EDL	01:00:03,967	01:00:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Well we might actually know soon
EDL	01:00:06,271	01:00:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Because I actually have one more stop
EDL	01:00:10,367	01:00:15,999	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Cross country ranked Choice voting tour the Great
EDL	01:00:15,999	01:00:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	State of Maine
EDL	01:00:19,583	01:00:20,863	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Super politically diverse
EDL	01:00:21,375	01:00:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Fiercely independent like a lot of independent voters
EDL	01:00:28,031	01:00:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	An infected in 2016 there was this
EDL	01:00:31,103	01:00:33,663	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Coalition of Independence and Democrat
EDL	01:00:34,175	01:00:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That Minister get this
EDL	01:00:35,711	01:00:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ballot initiative
EDL	01:00:36,991	01:00:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That would change all Statewide elections to ranked-choice voting
EDL	01:00:41,343	01:00:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Statewide
EDL	01:00:42,111	01:00:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:42,879	01:00:44,671	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And Rachel's voting was
EDL	01:00:44,671	01:00:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Adopted into
EDL	01:00:45,951	01:00:50,047	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	16 according to Maine public radio reporter Steve mistler
EDL	01:00:50,047	01:00:50,559	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It passed
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The past however
EDL	01:00:52,095	01:00:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	With a major flaw
EDL	01:00:53,887	01:00:54,399	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	BM
EDL	01:00:54,911	01:00:58,751	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Undermine the Integrity of our election process
EDL	01:00:59,519	01:01:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The state
EDL	01:01:00,543	01:01:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Senate
EDL	01:01:01,567	01:01:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Was under Republican
EDL	01:01:02,847	01:01:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Control at
EDL	01:01:03,615	01:01:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The time
EDL	01:01:04,639	01:01:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Picked up on
EDL	01:01:06,175	01:01:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Is constitutional conflict
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:10,271	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Within a conflict within the state
EDL	01:01:10,271	01:01:12,831	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Constitutionality is we're not happy with it
EDL	01:01:12,831	01:01:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like my post
EDL	01:01:15,135	01:01:21,023	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	The main Constitution literally says you have to use a plurality vote the word plurality is actually written
EDL	01:01:21,791	01:01:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In the Constitution as opposed to a majority
EDL	01:01:24,351	01:01:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Correct
EDL	01:01:25,119	01:01:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And ultimately the Maine legislature
EDL	01:01:26,911	01:01:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Past
EDL	01:01:27,679	01:01:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Oh law
EDL	01:01:28,959	01:01:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That delayed implementing
EDL	01:01:31,007	01:01:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ranked-choice voting
EDL	01:01:32,543	01:01:34,335	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This is one more example
EDL	01:01:34,847	01:01:35,615	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Of where
EDL	01:01:37,151	01:01:38,687	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Yeah politician
EDL	01:01:38,687	01:01:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ark standing against
EDL	01:01:41,759	01:01:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And it set off this whole fight where where people rallied against the state legislature and held another vote
EDL	01:01:48,159	01:01:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In June
EDL	01:01:48,927	01:01:49,695	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Literally this
EDL	01:01:49,695	01:01:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	This past June at the Statehouse this
EDL	01:01:52,511	01:01:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Morning to get around the delay
EDL	01:01:53,791	01:01:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Nature through what
EDL	01:01:54,559	01:01:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Was billed as a people's veto
EDL	01:01:56,351	01:01:57,119	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	That passed
EDL	01:01:57,119	01:01:58,655	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	I almost the exact same margin
EDL	01:01:59,167	01:02:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	If not slightly more
EDL	01:02:00,447	01:02:02,495	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	In what it passed originally in 20
EDL	01:02:02,495	01:02:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	16
EDL	01:02:03,263	01:02:05,823	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	At some point the main Supreme Court gets involved
EDL	01:02:06,335	01:02:10,175	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	And really the details of this are all kind of a mess but
EDL	01:02:10,175	01:02:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	What it boils down to is
EDL	01:02:12,991	01:02:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Any upcoming election
EDL	01:02:14,527	01:02:16,063	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Like the midterms that are happening now
EDL	01:02:16,831	01:02:18,367	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Maine will use
EDL	01:02:18,879	01:02:20,159	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Ranked-choice voting
EDL	01:02:20,159	01:02:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	For its Congressional races
EDL	01:02:22,207	01:02:23,487	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We have three of them this year
EDL	01:02:23,999	01:02:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	We have a first congressional
EDL	01:02:26,047	01:02:27,071	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	District race
EDL	01:02:27,071	01:02:31,679	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	It'll be used in that contest and also in Maine's 2nd congressional district
EDL	01:02:31,679	01:02:33,215	| radiolab_podcast18tweakthevote |	Which is a swing C1
