EDL	00:00:13,056	00:00:14,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Part of it kind of an ongoing
EDL	00:00:15,104	00:00:19,200	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	NeverEnding National conversation touches on some cases before The Supreme Court
EDL	00:00:20,224	00:00:20,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So
EDL	00:00:21,504	00:00:26,880	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We certainly have been able to stop thinking about it so we thought we would share this with you again and at the very end of the hour
EDL	00:00:27,392	00:00:28,928	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We have a little update
EDL	00:00:29,440	00:00:30,720	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Super interesting

EDL	00:00:51,200	00:00:52,480	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah okay good
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,528	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we're just doing this because
EDL	00:00:55,040	00:01:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Because that article you wrote we hope you'd one of the most amazing things I've ever read

EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A story about
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,328	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A decision
EDL	00:01:07,328	00:01:12,704	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About a decision that we as human beings we've only recently begun to consider
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:16,800	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There are stories like this elsewhere but somehow
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,360	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Not too many
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:25,760	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we're going to devote the entire hour to just this one story which I think is a first pressing it is and the story comes to us from
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Woman named Kelly Benham she's a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times in Florida
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe going to do this is chronologically just sort of
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,208	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Across time
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where were you and who
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What did you want to do
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:41,888	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When I decide to have a baby with you one of those people who
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Ever since you were young
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You knew that you would be a mom
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah I did but I wasn't like I didn't play with a lot of dolls or babysit
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I bet I always just kind of had this weird
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:54,944	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Certainty that
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,480	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I have a daughter
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,784	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm a daughter not a son
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:03,648	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe son too but I don't know I think I was I would have a daughter and a sword had this image of her in my head
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Image
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:08,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like really feisty mischievous
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dark hair
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dirty face

EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I really want to have a baby
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I wanted one very badly but I just
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Couldn't see how it made sense for me to be the father
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's Tom French also journalists at the Tampa Bay Times or he was a dime he and Kelly have been dating for a few years
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Years but he was a good 10 years older than her
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I had two kids
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Suns
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Approaching the end of college
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I was ready to travel I wanted to see you Spain and
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,400	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Greeson the world going to err on the
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:52,544	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	On the cruise ship where you get to be the mail pokermaster whatever you need or I would have an issue with Springsteen
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,616	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Bring me falling Springsteen around Europe
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I've made up my mind
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,552	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No more kids but she was insistent I stuck to it she saw our daughter very clearly oh yeah
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,392	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Saw that I was destined to be that little girl's father
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And was that at happy gentle disagreement or the other kind
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was brutal
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:16,864	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He broke up and when we worked at the same place there's kind of invisible line and then
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,936	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The Newsroom that neither of us would cross the mailboxes
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It really was alive it was a horrible time we called the dark era the dark.
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It was the worst Halloween section of Target
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I am my son's and I have loved Halloween forever I love it when I was a little kid and
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just wanted to see what they have anything new cuz I had
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know I usually check out there gargoyles now There Staffing
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,400	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So I just was kind of walking through the Section browsing and then something
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just stopped me in my tracks
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:04:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Apparently was it was really like kind of a lightning bolt Epiphany just so wait a minute maybe you are
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Thinking about the straight you're acting as though
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You're 80
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then it hit me that
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,648	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nobody knows how much time they have
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:18,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To have a child is to embrace a future that you can't control
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Remember those words so I had to come to Jesus meeting with myself among the Gargoyles
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:30,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And that was when I realized I need to just take a step back and try to restart the conversation with
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know I went home and wrote me this long letter and I just
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was over by that point on
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I wasn't looking back
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So you know over a few months with a little while
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They patched things up eventually got married and started trying to make a baby
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We thought that this would just happen right away
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then of course it didn't
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You're trying and trying the regular way she took drugs that make you
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:05,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Drop a bunch of eggs at one time after that the turkey baster method there's like kind of a process that they walk you through
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	After turkey baster IVF
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I never thought that it would get that far but it would go farther because after trying IVF three times
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Stetson work so they said we can try with an egg donor meaning you get a friend's would be willing to donate the egg take the egg put it in the day
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dish forcibly impregnated with Tom sperm then you insert the egg into your kind of the Magic Bullet
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Infertility
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kind of like
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You don't know what's wrong with your car you just replace the whole engine
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kelly asked a good friend to be an egg donor they implanted the egg
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Shortly after she took a pregnancy test
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:43,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I said way too early it's at the line was super super faint
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Wasn't even sure I could see it at all
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So I took a photograph of the pregnancy test and I put it into Photoshop
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I actually had to dial up the contrast
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:59,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To make the the line appear that is everything
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:06,335	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This is so high-tech right
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was like oh my God I think there's two lines there
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So I waited and I and I did it a second time
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then I
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But I told Tom
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:22,463	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Did you go into like the expectant parent mode and
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,487	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh yeah
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Touch up the paint
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:31,679	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know I patch the little holes in the wall everything was perfect everything
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Was absolutely
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Perfect
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Until it wasn't
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:45,503	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	5 months into her pregnancy 20 weeks which is just about halfway cuz a full-term is 40 Kelly was at a park
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Playing with her dog and I just felt a little bit
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,367	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Weird
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just started to bleed
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But not a lot
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Any amount of blood is not a good thing and I called the doctor's office and they didn't seem too concerned they're like
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah you probably want to go to the hospital and get that checked and I went to pick her up and
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,335	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	By the time we got to the hospital she was in a lot of pain
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cramping cramping cramping I knew something was really really wrong they got me nowhere
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:23,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What is wheelchairs they wheeled me into the surf triage room and by that point like blood was just
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Coming out of me chunks of blood coming out of me and I didn't know I thought it was baby Parts like falling
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:35,679	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I thought I'm having a miscarriage like the baby's going to drop out on the floor
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was throwing up
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then the doctor came in and he looked scared
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Does the doctor say something or what happens
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The doctor
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,807	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Explain to me quietly there was something it was making it difficult
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To stop Kelly's bleeding
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And if they couldn't stop it we might lose Kelly
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:01,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And Kelly heard the doctor say this and I need to tell you Kelly is the toughest
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Most Fearless person I've ever known
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But she grabbed my arm
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's hard as anyone has ever grabbed my arm and I remember just
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Don't let me down
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Please don't let me die
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It was terrifying and then
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sandpoint they
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They brought in an ultrasound machine to see what was going on with the baby and I assume the baby was long dead I'm going to have her baby Parts on the floor
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Or I didn't know
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And they hooked up his machine and they were moving on and around and around and trying to pick up heartbeat in there was nothing
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Adam
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,631	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was apologizing to Tom
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm sorry like you know I just knew the baby was gone
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Then all of a sudden
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There was just this heartbeat
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,415	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Recorded on her cell phone
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:06,815	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Baby's heartbeat super super fast so it sounds like a rabbit or something
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:13,215	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah this heartbeat pops up and then there's the baby and you can see it and she looks fine she's too
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Totally oblivious she says right there
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:22,431	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Now I thought oh my God I'm going to watch her die
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm going to watch you die in front of me Anna
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Then they started just pumping me full of drugs to try to get this labor stop
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There's this drug called magnesium sulfate in one of the effects of it is it just makes you
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can a boil from the inside
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But eventually
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They got the contraction stop they got the bleeding stopped they put me in the hospital room
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And they said
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Get to 24 weeks
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cuz that's that's the limit
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So 4 more weeks
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,735	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sounds like they got a line in the sand like you must get to 24 or there's no
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Ny-24 what's special about them that number they told me that
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,511	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	24 weeks is kind of pill abuse
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Definition of viability
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That sort of grew out of
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When they were
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Fighting out
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Roe v Wade
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:26,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Example the Court ruled that a woman who commits an abortion on herself is guilty of no crime against
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Stories I understand a robber
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In Roe v Wade the Supreme Court was trying to strike this balance they wanted to protect a woman's right to choose as we
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,439	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But they also want to say that there are limits to that right
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:41,023	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If there is some moment in the development of the fetus in the course of this pregnant
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We cross this line in
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	At least no longer just about to women's rights now you have to think about the state's interest in The Unborn Child
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:53,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The problem of course is weird you draw that line
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Not now that is the million-dollar question
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Duke University
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So that kind of bass
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Gas at that point the best
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Medical objective standard that the justices could come up with the 1973 was
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Liability
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And the word viable in this case means can it survive on its own
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Outside of the woman's womb a fetus is developed enough that you can take it out of the mother's womb and it can still see
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Survive
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That liquid suggested is the point when it is no longer okay to have an abortion
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Because across that line a fetus is
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Quotes viable
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Send the question was when does a fetus cross that line
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When can it survive on its own
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:44,511	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Well we begin but you got this in our brief with the development of the
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Human
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,303	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Embryo
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:52,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Here's where you get to the 24-week thing what ended up happening was the court considered what was known about fetal development
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And their trucks that show this
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Feel like this 3 weeks a fetus has brain and heart begin to develop a tweaks nerve fibers 13 to 16 weeks the fetus begin
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Removing them kick at 23 weeks some fetuses respond to familiar sounds like a mother's voice and at 24 weeks
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,367	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Air sacs form in the lungs
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And thinking was maybe that's the point
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The minimum point
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where the fetus is viable straps breathe on its own butt
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This was just a theoretical idea
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,775	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No one was testing it no one was trying to take the fetus
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Out of a mother at 24 weeks to see if it would survive
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:31,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In fact
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Throughout the 70s and 80s most hospitals according to Kelly
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:38,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Drew the line of viability back a little bit farther
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	28 weeks
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And that is because
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Somewhere around the
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	28th week of gestation the lungs start to produce
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,743	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Eye fluid called surfactant
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Which prevents the lungs from collapsing and sticking together between breaths
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's a really important thing
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:58,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Super a long time the actual viability line not the theoretical one
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What's 28 weeks
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But then
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:07,455	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In the late seventies someone invented an artificial lung surfactant kind of a slippery white stuff that they shoot
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Down the ventilator tube in the baby's born and that combined with
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	IV nutrition new super small ventilators moved the line of viability back
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,719	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	2 round where does now
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where does now is
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:25,119	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Generally around 24 but here's the thing depending on what hospital you're in
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In what doctor is on call sometimes it can be 23
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	25
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,799	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cases 22 so
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Given modern technology
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:38,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Imagine says need a one-day the line could jump way back
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Will make things really
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:46,879	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tricky if for example we get to the point where modern signs able to develop an artificial womb
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Does viability start at the points of a fertilized egg
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The standard is
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:58,399	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The point at which the developing child can actually survive outside of the womb using any psychological intervention
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,215	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Apple that is a slippery line indeed
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They said
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Get to 24 weeks
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cuz that's the limit
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,943	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Which made the doctors have to pump Kelly full of drugs
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:13,503	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Keep her feet elevated for at least
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Another 4 weeks
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But I just
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:19,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kept going into labor
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In and out of it and they felt like they couldn't hold it off anymore
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,255	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And at 23 weeks and 4 days
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A doctor tells her that
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There's nothing more they can do the baby is going to come
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,655	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A day
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe to a guy comes in
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Adam
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I hate he
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:39,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He seems a little uncomfortable like this was not pleasant for him
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:44,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He said you know your baby's probably coming in 24 to 48 hours and we know how hard
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:50,879	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You work to have his baby and we know how much you want this baby and we assume that you want everything done
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,927	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Does that mean we have no idea
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we said
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We're not sure if we do when everything done paint the picture for us doctor
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,327	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And he said
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Now there's about a 53% chance that the baby will die no matter what we do
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,751	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	53 yeah
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,543	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Whatever we do whatever we do
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There was a small chance that she could be fine
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What were those chances
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,663	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About 20
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I felt like like 20%
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know it
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's not a
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,647	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's not a possibility it seems like a like a reasonable
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:29,791	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It seems like worth a gamble until you really think about what the 80% means I mean
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,607	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He could be on a ventilator for the rest of her life
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She have a massive
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Bleed in her brain and it was like eat holes in her brain and
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Affect her ability to think
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Or talk or walk
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She could
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pretty good chance she could be blind
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Or death
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There was no way for the doctors to predict
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But the doctor said no is it when the baby came
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The world
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,487	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It would need a ton of medical
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:03,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It may even need to be revived and so the question for the
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kelly was
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Do they want the doctors to do that they want them to pursue every measure possible or
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just left
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nature take its course
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And he said it would be we should decide
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Before the baby came because once the baby came
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,551	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We saw the baby it would be really hard to say no
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,903	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So if if no was going to be the answer we need to just say that before the baby came
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,023	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The worst night ever
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You trying to make up your mind
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,911	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About what
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What's right
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like what we be torturing this baby
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	For nothing
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We didn't want her to be born out of life that she would
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hate us for having
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There have been instances where children with birth defects are genetic diseases
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,575	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I filed wrongful life suits
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Essentially claiming they should have never been born
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We had to really debate what was
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In her best interest
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What would she want
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I started to
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Really struggle with
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:12,447	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Whether I was being selfish whether I had already pushed too far
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And this was like
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	God or the universe
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pushing back
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Warehouse
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Marriage might break up
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We lose our ability to
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,271	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Try again for another child I felt like
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:31,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I might get a baby but I would lose everything else and
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,183	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I think I got pretty close
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Uno
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All night as we're talking this through and
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,119	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm trying to figure it out
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:44,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We could hear
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:48,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The baby's heartbeat to the monitor
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:54,175	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Baby was letting us know all night right here I'm right here
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where you had to say yes
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Are now out loud
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I will ask for second opinion or
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A second opinion but another console we had some more questions
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And a nurse practitioner from the NICU came to the room yes my name is Diane lysel I'm a neonate
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,919	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Little nurse practitioner this is the next day had asked
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To speak to someone again and instead of just
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:31,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Fighting numbers in statistics
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I don't give numbers different for each baby she kind of started to paint a picture
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This is what I've seen I've been doing this 30 years
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:41,791	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But more importantly I also told them that
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,071	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It wasn't
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh yes or no decision
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She said you know you don't have to decide right now
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They could have the baby
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Baby came out crying
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	An active then we should do everything we can for the baby
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But the baby came out blue and length intraventricular hemorrhage
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We could stop
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We didn't have to keep
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Going
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:11,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Something goes horribly wrong we can withdraw the support and then you can hold her baby until it dies
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But you can give your baby a chance and see how it goes
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In other words
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In a very real way
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,423	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They could give this decision
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To the baby
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,311	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That same night
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was feeling like I'm just uncomfortable
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:33,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Couple hours later discomfort turns the pain finally a doctor came in and was like
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah your labor we have to go right now so that it was like super super quick or
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Light shot in spine cutting me open and then
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh my God there's a third
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Person in this room
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But not really not quite almost I mean
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Trousseau
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So early
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What did she look like
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,735	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Why didn't see her
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Then
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just saw like her kind of Wiz buy an incubator
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:12,671	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she just doing a little dark smear
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And a hat
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,559	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And in did you make it to 24 weeks
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Swimmer one day shift
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	23 weeks
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And 6 days
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:35,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Will be back in just a moment hi this is Kelly Friend
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	OK Google
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:39,551	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Radiolab supported
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm parked by the National Science Foundation
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sound at www.slha.org
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:21:00,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I hate everybody Pat Walters here producer at Radiolab
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I'm here because I need your help this summer I'm hosting a show and I've request
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:13,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:19,488	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About what we're calling tiny moments of Brilliance basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,512	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So did something
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:26,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It just means you bring back and say whoa how did they do that maybe it was the moment that I can
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:39,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score or maybe the math class
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:46,112	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Reading music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:52,512	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Does something super smart but it doesn't have anything to do with the test if you have a story with us
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:58,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Go to radiolab.org Brilliance and record a short audio message for us again that's
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:03,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Radiolab.org / Brilliance thank you so much
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Ron I'm Robert krulwich Radiolab today we're spending the entire hour on a single story
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:27,328	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We saw in the Tampa Bay Times Kelley Benham a journalist published an unbelievably
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Wonderful set of articles
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About her and her husband Tom French was also a journalist
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,240	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They had a baby
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:36,544	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Except their baby came very
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:41,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Very early so full term as we mention is 40 weeks their daughter arrived
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:45,760	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	23 weeks and 6 days would be just a little bit over halfway
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,296	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No just to put that in context
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:52,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If a baby is born before 22 weeks it's generally considered a miscarriage
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,488	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pretty much no doctor is going to interview
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:00,096	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If a baby is born after 25 weeks
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:07,008	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They've been all kinds of studies which show that doctors then feel morally obliged to save that life no matter what the parents
EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,056	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Say so before 22
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And after 25
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:14,688	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Things are pretty clear but between 22 and 25
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dillon danis
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Gray Zone
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This strange little liminal space between life and death
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:24,160	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We have to answer some really tough
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:25,952	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:27,744	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Should my baby live
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,024	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	At what cost
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,608	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Who gets to decide and ultimately Windows life
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Begin
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:40,544	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kelly and Tom like many parents who land in this Zone decided for the hardest question to the baby
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The baby will tell them whether it's going to stay or whether it's going to go
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:47,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So they delivered by C-section and their daughter
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sweet that boy didn't have a name was whisked off to the
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:52,832	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Neonatal intensive care unit for the NICU
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,880	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Eventually they went to see her
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And they need to beat her
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	For the first time
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she was
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:02,816	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,400	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like weirdly perfect
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,008	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She had all the parts
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Lisa
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Long fingers
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,128	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Long feet
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Delicate little nose and she had hair and fingernails and
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Eyebrows and you all the things that they're supposed to have
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But she was
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Translucent
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:34,304	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You could just see right through you can see all the veins running on her skin you could see her heart
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Thumping in her chest
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And her eyes were sealed shut
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:40,704	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like a puppy
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,008	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I'm
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Bike Meetup
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She had bruises all over her body and she had a black eye
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:51,200	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just from the you know they were very
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,480	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Careful with them when they're born but
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just that very delicate handling
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:58,368	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Kind of batteries these babies because they're so fragile
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I mean it was
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We are lucky to know how it's supposed to feel
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I mean you want to
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Believe that
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The minute you meet your daughter there's going to be like
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:16,032	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Butterflies Sido or like unicorns
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Supposed to be the best moment your life
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But they were so much Terror
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Inside that moment
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:23,200	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was terrified because
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I love being a father my relationship with my son is
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Extremely bored
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:33,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I was really terrified that she would be so alien
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Haven't been born at 23 weeks
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:35,232	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	6 days
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That I wouldn't
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,048	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Recognize her as
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	My daughter
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,888	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I wouldn't bond with her that I was now. Thought was
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,192	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Filled with the real dread
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,728	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Andam
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,264	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I wanted to see her
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,568	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I could see that
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,640	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Only
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:53,664	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Have finished
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:55,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Barely a pound that point
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So training my brain couldn't even process
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	House martial arts
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The nurse Quinn
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You can touch her you know
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Stunt I didn't think I would be able to and so she had me
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Washington Starlight my hands once Shamy do it again
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She showed me how to reach in through this little round portal
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,496	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I think you better
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:25,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And explain how to touch her you don't rub the skin because the skin will come off if you do that when they're born that early
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,456	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You just press gently
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And so
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:34,368	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The baby was lying there not with her fist but with her arms extended
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,392	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The Palms open
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:40,000	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So her right palm was right there when I reach my left hand and I just
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Put my
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	My left
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Gently into her palm and she just
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Wrapping tight and in that
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Moment
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All my fears about not being able to bond with her washed away
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:05,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Panda
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:11,488	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh yeah what what got to me was
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,048	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,120	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I could be so afraid
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When she was so strong
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:26,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	At that point to
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,944	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was the most beef
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,040	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I told her
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:37,088	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hippie
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Daddy
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,096	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When a baby is this early
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Parents and the doctors
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:53,984	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Are watching very carefully trying to guess is this baby ready to be out in the world
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:55,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is it going to make it
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,592	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tom says when she grabbed his finger
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:01,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That wasn't just been bonding he felt
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like she was saying something
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:09,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She made her will very very clear to live
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And that was a phrase We heard again and again some babies will
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:17,792	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can use a Tempe plasma cells over the first few hours and days of their life
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's a neonatologist we spoke to Keith Berrington get a gut feeling
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:24,704	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm at Stanley's Allegan the nurse practitioner
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	After meeting the baby that
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This one looks very fragile
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Or
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This one can do it
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Babies declared itself
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What does that mean
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What are you seeing
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:41,088	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When something that premature declares itself
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:45,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And here we ran into a real difference parents will often see will in a credible
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:49,024	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Will and resolve doctors and nurses
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nothing much
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:53,632	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That sounds a bit too mystical for me I wouldn't take it
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	As there's a
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Voice inside the baby saying I'm going to be a fighter I'm not
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:01,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	One is sick enough not to be able to fight and one isn't
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:04,128	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can you see a spirit in a in a kid
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can I think you can see if some fight I call it's Punk a lot of times
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:12,064	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That is Tracy Howlett registered nurse
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:18,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was Kelly and Tom's primary nurse at All Children's Hospital and like everyone we spoke to on the hospital side when it comes to this issue
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,768	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She chooses her words very carefully
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:26,144	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe try to keep things a little bit more neutral than talking about their will to live
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:31,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Easy no baby at 23 weeks barely has folds on the outside of its brain it's Brandon. Smooth
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,032	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pinellas Park
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:38,432	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So who knows what it's capable of thinking or feeling well that's a difficult question in the truth is
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Things like fights Punk may just boil down to physiology maybe that baby had a few more lung buds to start
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:50,976	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Start with an easier time in utero may have nothing to do with Will in fact that they be grasping the finger
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Eva Peron
EDL	00:29:52,768	00:29:54,304	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's actually a reflex
EDL	00:29:55,584	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The babies have a grasp reflex I never tell a parent that because they think it's an intentional
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:08,384	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Movement because you're putting yourself in the parents had it if you've got to decide how much my going to put how much of my heart
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:10,688	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm going to pour into this little creature
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If you can see something like will or something like intention if you see oh that's a person in there
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,112	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe you don't see it
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe it's the only way you got to make this decision
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is my wife the professional messages often says
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:25,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We don't make
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:28,864	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Important decisions in our life the rational reasons very often
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:35,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Keith and his wife any janvier have done a huge amount of research into the ethics of extremely premature birth
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,848	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But one of the primary reasons we going to talk to him
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:39,872	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is that
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:44,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Addition to being a neonatologist and a guy who publishes a lot of stuff in this area
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,552	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He and his wife recently had a baby girl
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Who is born at 24 weeks and 5 days
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Shwetha 720g
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	One and a half pounds
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She's actually in my own and I see you
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,584	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh wow
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:02,144	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was I see the director of the unit where she was
EDL	00:31:04,192	00:31:07,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So he was in his unit in the place where he usually work
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,056	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He saw babies make it
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Not make it and now suddenly he was
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:13,920	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Apparent in that place
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And several weeks after his baby was born
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:22,112	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There is a very very big complication xian she didn't move
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,648	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I told for about 36 hours
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How many thought maybe it was a little lamb
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,280	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe it's time
EDL	00:31:30,304	00:31:32,096	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So they decided he and his wife
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To Let Her Go
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,192	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Peacefully
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:36,960	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I went back into the NICU to see you
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And something happened he look down
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:43,104	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Any saw
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Her lips move
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Barely started sucking on the shoes of the nested put in their mouth
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was sucking on a pacifier
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:53,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was just a reflex
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:56,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The most basic baby reflexes sucking reflex
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He knew that
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:57,952	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just that movement to sucking on the zoo the
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Changed his mind completely when I went back to Annie and said them be constipated really need to
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,728	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Continuing and give her the chance
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,032	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Too but you knew that
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,360	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Suck the sucking response is not that's a fairly
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:22,528	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Deep-brain yes is a very basic is just the brain stem is not snowing and you need a lot more than be able to suck
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Look to It To Em to do well
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:28,928	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	As I was trying to be the parent there not many Nate elegist
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What can you remember if the doctor and you was surprised that the father in you
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah I think I was actually a little
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:37,632	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah I think if I do
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:39,680	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Ben Moore
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:44,288	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Evidence-based and rational and scientific, I thought I could have
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Gone either way
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:48,384	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But just as a father I couldn't do that Point Mexico
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just didn't really know how to process it
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:54,016	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I felt like
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,808	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She was
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just had this very acute sense that she had just been like a violently ripped out of my body
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,792	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I could just feel where they cut her out
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:07,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:10,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like I just wanted to put her back
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,448	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pitmaker safe
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:13,984	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I and how these questions going through my head like
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,432	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How long does she have to live for us to get a birth certificate
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It has to be real
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:27,808	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like I felt like she might die and
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:30,624	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And like it wouldn't count
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:32,928	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I wouldn't be a mother
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You don't even
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:38,304	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like what if she died like what would have happened
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:39,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like when we have a funeral
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,168	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They make caskets a size of shoe boxes
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:44,704	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm always like
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,216	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Screwed up the
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:49,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's the stuff you think about but your brain goes
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:51,104	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Places you just can't control or predict
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:54,944	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And if she
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:56,736	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I wondered like
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:33:58,016	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If she knew
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She really aware that I was even standing there like
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Which is a reflex that made her got my finger
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When she grabbed it and she know
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:09,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Did you know I was there and she didn't know I was there. She wonder where I've gone
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:14,144	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Did she feel alone and is she scared
EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:20,288	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All she could really do at that point
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:22,848	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sit with us
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:25,920	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And it just became this waiting game
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Will continue in a moment
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hey I'm Jared I'm Robert krulwich this is Radiolab and we are spending the whole hour
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,928	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	With Tampa Bay Times Reporter at Kelley Benham and her husband Tom French
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A story that they're telling us
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,744	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tibet this limbo
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A a space that's that's literally between life and death
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We have to tackle some really big questions yeah
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Well there's anyone I dump when did you decide to name your daughter Juniper
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:26,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About five days after she was born
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,992	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Now in those 5 days pretty much everything in their lives changed
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The most superficial level they began their Hospital stay Day Zero
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In the maternity ward
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:45,280	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can butterflies on the walls and images of roses opening
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Adam
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:52,448	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everyone's really good looking like in an ER sort away or are they going to Grey's Anatomy kind of way we had
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:54,752	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like one superhot we call her cupcake
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she had this like glossy hair and you know people would visit me and they be like hey is cupcake here
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,456	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What is cupcake coming by
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,040	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And so that's where their Hospital Journey began the 5 days later
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:10,112	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everything Has Changed they find themselves on a different
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Florida Hospital
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Stranded in this unit
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:19,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It is perhaps more than any other place on Earth the physical embodiment of this limbo the neonatal intensive
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,864	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Square unit the NICU
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:22,656	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where they just have to wait
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:26,752	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And hope that that will or whatever it was they saw on Juniper
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:29,056	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Takes hold
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We have been like
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yanked out of our lives
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:39,040	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And out of everything that we recognized
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,856	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	LIRR jobs at her house
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And we just been
EDL	00:36:44,672	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Got to do this
EDL	00:36:46,464	00:36:48,768	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Science fiction
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nothing was recognizable
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:54,656	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Babysitting look like babies you know
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:58,496	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	There's one baby that had his intestines being outside of his body
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Piled up on his belly like in this bag
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:07,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everyone's wearing uniform don't know who anyone is
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,808	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And everything's like be big humming and
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,720	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I don't know how you're going to be there and you don't have any sense of time
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like day and night don't mean anything
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah we're sort of dimly aware of the Sun
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:27,936	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Rising and setting out the window
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:29,472	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Other than that
EDL	00:37:29,984	00:37:30,752	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's just
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just like
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Minute to minute hour to hour
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,872	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You're afraid to leave even for
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:39,456	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You for an hour to get some lunch because the baby could die
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know if we went home to get some sleep when she
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,832	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Wichita is that critical and
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:49,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She had roughly
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Five six days that went pretty well
EDL	00:37:52,768	00:37:54,560	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then that next weekend
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:38:02,752	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Blue horn Destin's beginning of a lot of problems
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:09,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And her belly turned dark and got real distended inserting drains in the belly
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To try to drain away stool and donk
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:21,952	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she just had this little straw sticking out of her belly and then they couldn't maintain your blood pressure
EDL	00:38:21,952	00:38:28,352	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So I was thinking of everything I could do cuz you don't want to feel powerless in a situation like that you want to feel like there's something Uke
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Can do
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:32,448	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So in Quiet Moments what time we do chapter 1
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:33,472	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The boy who left
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:35,776	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is he would stand over Juniper's incubator
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:41,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And you would read her Harry Potter mr. and mrs. dursley of number four privet Drive
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We're proud to say that they were perfectly normal
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:46,784	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Thank you very much they were the last people you'd expect
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To be involved in anything strange or mysterious
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:50,624	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	As I start reading to her
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:52,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And as the days went on
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She has no idea what I'm reading right but there is something there that
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She responded to I want to say she like because her her sat number would go High. Point
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:08,288	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Pursat number what is it like for oxygen saturation of oxygen are blood
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:13,152	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Temp says that number on the monitor was one of the only ways they can get feedback but how she's doing
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:16,736	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Because your eyes are still closed there be times when she wasn't moving around alot
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:18,272	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The higher the number the better
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,088	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He says when he would read to her
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:25,440	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Remembers would go up not just slowly but in stomach
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But then
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,304	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When I got deeper into the story
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:34,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I read in Hagrid's voice biotic Professor Dumbledore sir
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:35,680	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Set the Giant
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,496	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,264	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:42,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She decided instantly
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:47,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It is larger just going off and going off a cliff and Kelly hit me and she said you're scaring the baby
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,272	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I'm like what what
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:52,832	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You could see
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,856	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Even before Horizon
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:57,184	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But she was really responding to what we were doing
EDL	00:39:57,696	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She didn't know what chapter is but she was in her own way
EDL	00:40:01,792	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Very eagerly waiting for the next job
EDL	00:40:05,120	00:40:07,680	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I don't know a better way to describe one to be a lie
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Then you want to find out what happens next
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,896	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Unfortunately what happens next is that one night around 2 in the morning
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:19,712	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A rear night that they actually went to sleep at home
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:22,016	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They got a call from their doctor
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:24,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	His first question was how far do you live from the hospital
EDL	00:40:26,368	00:40:28,416	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Daniel that's not a question you want to hear from your child
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We'd like Rush Hospital
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:35,584	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	When they get there they were told that she did again she got another hole
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:43,776	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Another holder Destin's and she started to really spiral
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:50,176	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I really go downhill her blood pressure and oxygen levels were crashing she was on 100%
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:56,576	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oxygen the ventilator settings are turnips high as they can go and she was still struggling and faltering and you know once they are giving her baby
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:02,976	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	100% oxygen they can't give her anymore at that point that done everything that I could possibly two
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:09,376	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This is Bowser Shaquille Hospital
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:15,776	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everything she could think of blood pressure medicine antibiotics she put a drain in her abdomen that obviously was not enough
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:18,336	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What's wrong baby wrong we might lose her.
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:23,968	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The only option left to take her to the operating room with car open clear the intestines
EDL	00:41:23,968	00:41:25,248	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Relieve the pressure
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:28,320	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How do you do a surgery on a 1-pound baby it seems exactly
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:32,672	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I mean you don't either so extremely premature
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,464	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So fragile
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,512	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So tiny that operating
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Same kind of crazy
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:41,888	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dr. Shakil began to really consider the idea that
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,912	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Maybe this was it
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,960	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Headed that point
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:49,056	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I was in bed side
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,080	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Looking at her
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Trying to figure out what to do
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:55,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:58,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cuban rice
EDL	00:42:00,063	00:42:02,111	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Really yeah she opened her eyes
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Why didn't she looked at us
EDL	00:42:07,231	00:42:12,095	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Rise were like wide open and she was looking right at the doctor directly
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:14,143	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Exterior hard
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:17,215	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And it was very proud of the moment
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:24,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dr. shakeel says she decided right then and there
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:26,431	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Surgery
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I think she deserves a chance
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:33,599	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tell me more about why you made a decision typically babies who are that
EDL	00:42:34,111	00:42:34,623	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Critical
EDL	00:42:35,391	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Identity and responsive because they're just fighting for every breath and Divinity 2
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:41,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:47,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Open her eyes at that stage in our life when she had no blood pressure that I could barely record when she
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He had hardly any Oxygen
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	For her to just open your eyes and look at us
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Was a very powerful statement that I'm still here
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:56,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'm here
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I am still here don't give up
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:02,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Dr Shakil summon the Pediatric surgeon told her
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:04,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They want to move forward with the operation
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:06,367	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Surgeon said no
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:15,071	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The surgeon was adamant that she did not want to do it he said it's it's if it's futile and it's
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is she her blood pressure is so unstable that she would not make it out of the or
EDL	00:43:19,935	00:43:26,335	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Insurgent Elder even if I can open her up and do the job your skin is so papery that I might not be able to
EDL	00:43:26,335	00:43:29,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we're back up there are guidelines that
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,943	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Medical Industries have you been
EDL	00:43:30,943	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Basic things like the Hippocratic oath to do no harm that's law professor an ethicist Nita farahany again
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:38,111	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Many Physicians
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:43,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Legitimately believe that if you have a preterm infants and that infant is
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:47,071	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	In serious Peril of spending a life of
EDL	00:43:47,071	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Suffering and pain the only way to do know how I meant to feel your road
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:53,471	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	He's not to do the surgery
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:59,359	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But she says if you ask the court show right now the law favors
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:43:59,871	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Life
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:06,271	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The courts have seen very few cases that involve disputes like this but in everyone's so far she says
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:10,367	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They've supported the person who's arguing to keep the Child Alive
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:12,159	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It whenever there's life There's Hope
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:13,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	This is our windows we should do it now
EDL	00:44:15,999	00:44:19,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Productor Shaquille the argument that ultimately won the day
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:24,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Basically what I told her was that if you think she's going to die
EDL	00:44:24,191	00:44:26,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Well she is dying right now
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:28,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	As we speak in the unit
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:32,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we can either do nothing and she definitely dies or we can do something and she probably dies but
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,199	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You never know there is a slim chance
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:38,527	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So there we landed incubator with the baby in it
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:44,159	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And hold their little hand and she's getting ready to go into surgery and she was looking right at me
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:44,671	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:44:45,183	00:44:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She hadn't done that before
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:49,791	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It really seemed like she was aware that I was there
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:52,607	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Very clearly and she was a lock on my face
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So I can lie down try to give her a little kiss on her forehead
EDL	00:44:56,959	00:44:59,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Adopted the same thing and then they wheeled her way
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:02,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How long is the operation
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It was
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:12,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We think they call a page does much more quickly than we expected to come back so we knew
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,879	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Something was wrong
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:19,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The nurse assured Tom and Kelly into a separate room this little windowless
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:20,255	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Conference room
EDL	00:45:20,255	00:45:21,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And the surgeon came in and
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:23,327	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She said you know I
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She's supposed to go in and
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:29,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Clean everything out and runs everything off and find the hole and Patch it in and do all these things
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she said when she cut the baby open
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:37,919	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And touched the baby's intestines with her little probe
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She's the way she described it was everything fell apart
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It was just falling apart falling apart
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,575	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And you're hearing this
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:45,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:48,159	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Jennifer had survived the operation
EDL	00:45:48,927	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But barely
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So we're thinking like okay this was an incredibly risky surgery
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And we just threw it for nothing
EDL	00:45:57,631	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Anna
EDL	00:45:59,167	00:46:02,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Either I thought there was no way that they was going to live till morning
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:05,823	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I've been really working hard to avoid
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:08,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Thinking about all the bad things that were
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:09,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's waiting to happen here
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:13,247	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just trying to hold on you know and let certified with my job to do that
EDL	00:46:13,247	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And dumb
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:22,975	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Stereotypical email with me and
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:25,023	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And Tom says they were in the car
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:26,559	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Around the time of the surgery
EDL	00:46:26,559	00:46:27,839	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We're driving
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Bedtime
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,655	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	June bug and I were
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:32,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	About two-thirds of the way to the first book
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And the thought just snuck in on me which was
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:38,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What if I don't
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:40,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Get to finish reading her
EDL	00:46:40,895	00:46:41,407	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Facebook
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:45,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What if she doesn't get here then
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She never finds out you know
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:52,927	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What happens to Harry
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:56,767	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hermione and Ron
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That thought
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:02,143	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Letting the other
EDL	00:47:03,167	00:47:07,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Very difficult thoughts about all the things we wouldn't get to do it
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:09,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She would never get to know
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:16,991	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I had this terrible thought that you know she was in this incubator the sisal add plastic box and I
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Had this terrible thought that she was just going to go from one box to another
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:25,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I had to pull over
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:27,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just lost it and
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:35,423	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	At that point I wasn't maintaining there was no holding back this flood of
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:42,079	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We had a rule Kelly languages that only one of us got to lose it at a time
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:44,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That was my turn to loosen
EDL	00:47:45,663	00:47:50,271	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We're in a very unnatural situation of neonatal intensive care which is so
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:54,623	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Recent in the developed world and still doesn't exist too much of the world
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Working so hard to save babies is very new
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:00,767	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Neonatologists
EDL	00:48:00,767	00:48:05,119	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Keith Arrington and evolutionary history newborn babies very frequently died
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:09,727	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And most parents who have any significant number of children
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Head West one or two or three or more
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:18,431	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And in order to be able to carry on with your life and to provide for the rest of your family
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:24,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We have to be able to adapt to the death of a Pious and now that has become much less common to lose a baby
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:29,439	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Miscarriages and stillbirths so now we realizing
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:33,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	How much that hurts in the past maybe we've hit and some of them for myself
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No way the day was Callisto morning
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,727	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But what happened was
EDL	00:48:41,727	00:48:42,751	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Really strange
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:45,567	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She continued to just
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Not die
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:53,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And the next day she
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:48:57,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know she was still there
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:00,927	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The surgeon was surprised and
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:06,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No one could quite explain it the more I thought about it the more I found it
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I like surprising an interesting
EDL	00:49:08,863	00:49:11,167	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know because she doesn't know
EDL	00:49:12,447	00:49:13,983	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	If there's a better place
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,543	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know but she's just in this box
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:19,103	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she's got needles coming out of
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:21,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Every Witch Way and
EDL	00:49:21,663	00:49:22,687	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tube down her throat
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,991	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She has no idea that
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:28,831	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	One day you know she'll just be
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:29,599	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Held
EDL	00:49:30,623	00:49:31,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Rockton
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:33,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I'll take her out for ice cream and
EDL	00:49:33,695	00:49:35,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So play with the dog
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:39,327	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I just wonder like what is she fighting for
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:52,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So that became you know our job
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:59,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The best that we can articulate it was to try to give her some sense of something Beyond
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:05,439	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	On that place after the surgery things did not get
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:09,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She would stop breathing many times a day
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:13,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Teams with Russian to come back come back
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:19,775	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I just remember the room spinning and then she started to swell her like weeks and weeks
EDL	00:50:19,775	00:50:23,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But you continue to not die but you began to gain weight
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:26,943	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And you know nurses are very superstitious lot of them
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:33,855	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They won't say the word home for some reason when the babies hear that word to Tracy Hall it again primary nurse
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:35,903	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They get sick and we just
EDL	00:50:35,903	00:50:37,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's a Superstition obviously but
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:39,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Something happens
EDL	00:50:39,999	00:50:41,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And sometimes it can be
EDL	00:50:41,791	00:50:42,815	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Devastating
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:44,095	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So what do you say instead
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:50,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Riverside that place that the baby's going to go when they leave here
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:54,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sometimes we spell it which makes no sense at all
EDL	00:50:54,591	00:50:55,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	After about
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:56,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	4 and a half months
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:50:58,431	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Diana nurse practitioner
EDL	00:50:58,943	00:51:01,247	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Told us that we might want to think about buying a car seat
EDL	00:51:02,271	00:51:03,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That was
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:04,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	First
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:06,879	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Inclination
EDL	00:51:06,879	00:51:08,415	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That we might
EDL	00:51:08,415	00:51:14,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We'll take her out of there that's the first time I've ever imagined a choir of angels singing around mention of
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:20,447	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Car seat car seats right but when you're at when you want to have a baby really bad everybody else has a baby but you and you can't have a baby
EDL	00:51:20,447	00:51:24,799	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Baby things like shopping for car seats become like fantasies you know
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:28,127	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And finally you know the doctor gave the
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:29,663	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All clear and
EDL	00:51:30,943	00:51:33,247	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We took the monitors off of her
EDL	00:51:33,247	00:51:35,551	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she was completely free

EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:46,559	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Cuz I didn't know of her
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:48,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I should be okay in the sunlight
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:50,399	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She never seen the Sun
EDL	00:51:51,679	00:51:52,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I we all kind of
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:55,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Walked out and
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:51:57,823	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tracy's really not a hugger but

EDL	00:52:09,343	00:52:12,415	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That was totally before the gay thing before I stopped going to Chick-fil-A
EDL	00:52:13,439	00:52:15,743	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And all in all how long were you in the hospital for
EDL	00:52:16,255	00:52:17,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	6 and a half months
EDL	00:52:18,303	00:52:20,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	196 days

EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:36,991	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nice enough to allow it to send a reporter to their house
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:40,575	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	To meet her
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:46,719	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She's 2 years old now

EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:26,303	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You spend a lot of time chronicling
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:29,887	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Sometimes very terrible things and
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:32,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	What's interesting is that
EDL	00:54:32,703	00:54:34,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yesterday morning
EDL	00:54:35,007	00:54:36,287	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Journalistic standards

EDL	00:54:39,615	00:54:45,759	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It was it was it was wouldn't even be on journalistic radar

EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:57,023	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Especially after you've been through what we went through was
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:55:03,423	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everything and nothing you can do about it
EDL	00:55:03,423	00:55:09,823	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Everything happened yesterday and now it's not a couple hours the entire world was contain
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:15,967	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Inside of her
EDL	00:55:17,759	00:55:21,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	All the blank chapters of her life were inside that morning
EDL	00:55:24,415	00:55:25,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Which what you want this book
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:27,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	End
EDL	00:55:29,791	00:55:31,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Do you feel like you're out of the woods
EDL	00:55:32,351	00:55:34,143	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Well
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:35,935	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Both Tom and Kelly said
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:36,959	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	No way
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:39,519	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then Thom Tillis about these flu shots
EDL	00:55:40,031	00:55:40,543	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Jennifer gadd
EDL	00:55:41,055	00:55:43,103	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They're not just flu shots they're like gum
EDL	00:55:43,615	00:55:44,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Flu shots
EDL	00:55:44,383	00:55:45,919	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like super flu shots and they
EDL	00:55:46,431	00:55:47,711	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The sports shots you yet
EDL	00:55:48,223	00:55:51,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I swear to God they cost $14,000 for this Porsche
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:53,087	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And
EDL	00:55:53,087	00:55:55,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That is that the real number if you just said that's a fact
EDL	00:55:56,415	00:55:59,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They are designed to help protect her from
EDL	00:55:59,743	00:56:01,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	RSV
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:04,863	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Which is a virus that in most people just presentas a common cold
EDL	00:56:04,863	00:56:08,703	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	But I'm sure her lungs are still recovering and are still developing end
EDL	00:56:08,703	00:56:10,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	RSV can be devastating
EDL	00:56:11,007	00:56:12,543	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And there's some other concerns it
EDL	00:56:13,055	00:56:14,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Concealed Creepin down the road
EDL	00:56:14,847	00:56:17,919	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Some Studies have shown that the kids were born prematurely
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:20,735	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Struggle more in school with reading and math
EDL	00:56:21,247	00:56:22,015	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	That's
EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:23,807	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Often they're more susceptible to
EDL	00:56:24,575	00:56:27,391	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Depression and anxiety but I will say that
EDL	00:56:28,927	00:56:31,231	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We took her to visit a preschool the other day
EDL	00:56:31,999	00:56:36,095	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We took her there and set her down and she just took off and like
EDL	00:56:36,095	00:56:37,375	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Went up to the
EDL	00:56:37,375	00:56:38,655	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Giant children
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:43,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And started taking their toys and
EDL	00:56:43,519	00:56:46,847	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	They were singing The Wheels On The Bus you could see it in her eyes I know that song
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:51,199	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she didn't care about Tom Rye one bit
EDL	00:56:51,199	00:56:55,039	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know she was totally there with those kids and she was
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:56,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So ready
EDL	00:56:56,831	00:56:57,599	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And I thought
EDL	00:56:58,623	00:56:59,135	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Wow
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:00,927	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She might be okay

EDL	00:59:24,031	00:59:26,591	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	A lot more early than you were supposed to be born
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:29,151	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Super extra small
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:31,455	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I called
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:32,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	The hospital
EDL	00:59:32,479	00:59:38,879	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Over the summer and I said hey like every night we're talking about this can I show her the NICU like would you let me
EDL	00:59:38,879	00:59:45,279	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Just show her the space and what an incubator looks like and they were amazing about it and so
EDL	00:59:45,279	00:59:51,167	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Have an incubator in an empty room and they let her come in and just play in the room and
EDL	00:59:51,167	00:59:54,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Took her little doll baby that I
EDL	00:59:54,239	01:00:00,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Ordered for her on preemie doll baby, whatever that's like this size and weight that she was when she was a baby
EDL	01:00:00,639	01:00:04,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Is that a real thing
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:07,807	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So she could get an idea of how small she was I don't know if that'll be useful someday
EDL	01:00:08,319	01:00:14,719	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	So she took it to the NICU and she put it in the incubator and we showed her how we would reach our hands through the little
EDL	01:00:14,719	01:00:15,487	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Portholes
EDL	01:00:15,999	01:00:22,399	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And hold her hand and she reached in and held her little babies little cloth and then because she's due to veranda
EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:26,751	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Where she would do this she climbed into the freaking incubator and laid down
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:30,335	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And ask Tracy the nurse to close the lid
EDL	01:00:30,847	01:00:32,127	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Yeah
EDL	01:00:33,151	01:00:39,551	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Like she was I like that like that like that like
EDL	01:00:39,551	01:00:45,695	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And she said at one point during the visit this woman walked by the room
EDL	01:00:46,975	01:00:48,767	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She had that look about her like
EDL	01:00:49,791	01:00:51,583	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She's a couple days
EDL	01:00:51,583	01:00:52,351	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Postpartum
EDL	01:00:52,863	01:00:54,399	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I thought oh God you know
EDL	01:00:55,167	01:00:59,007	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Tracy kind of whisper in her ear Tracy the nurse and
EDL	01:00:59,519	01:01:01,055	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She looked at dinner and she said
EDL	01:01:02,079	01:01:04,383	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Oh my God she's so beautiful
EDL	01:01:04,383	01:01:10,783	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	And then she told us that she just had a baby a few days before that was born at 20
EDL	01:01:10,783	01:01:12,063	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	3 weeks and 6 days
EDL	01:01:14,367	01:01:17,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hippity hop hippity hop
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:21,535	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Hey baby hey hippity hop
EDL	01:01:24,095	01:01:30,495	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Nap speaking of that specific chocolate I'm 23 weeks 6 days we ended up checking back in with Annie different
EDL	01:01:30,495	01:01:36,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Funny professor of lawn phosphate Duke University about that whole viability question like that line of wind
EDL	01:01:36,895	01:01:43,295	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Preterm infant comes viable which at the time we did the stories seem to be roughly around 24 weeks
EDL	01:01:43,295	01:01:45,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Peaks on average has that changed at all
EDL	01:01:45,855	01:01:49,951	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	It's pointless to study that was in a 2015 we should serve a big survey
EDL	01:01:49,951	01:01:51,487	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Of outcomes
EDL	01:01:51,487	01:01:54,047	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	For preterm infants and it basically argued that
EDL	01:01:54,047	01:02:00,191	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	We might want to push that line back even further study author believes the 22 weeks is the new standard for viability
EDL	01:02:00,191	01:02:05,311	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Reborns that's 23 weeks and my 3 weeks and 6 days if that's too late
EDL	01:02:05,311	01:02:07,615	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	She says this is now the new conversation
EDL	01:02:08,127	01:02:08,895	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	22 weeks
EDL	01:02:09,407	01:02:12,479	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	24 you know this is something that's
EDL	01:02:12,479	01:02:17,343	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Physicians and hospitals are being educated about and look at where he at 22 weeks
EDL	01:02:17,855	01:02:23,999	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	You know in and it has been what two years since we last talked about this three years at most
EDL	01:02:23,999	01:02:27,839	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I mean so in three years if we've moved back two weeks
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:34,239	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	Then talk to me in another quarter of a century and will be at the beginning
EDL	01:02:34,239	01:02:40,639	| radiolab_podcast16update23weeks |	I think it's just a matter of time before we get to that artificial womb a case blessing I'll say by way of updates is it
