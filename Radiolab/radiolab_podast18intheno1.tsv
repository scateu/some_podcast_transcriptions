EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I begin to wonder if having sex I don't want is something I've absorbed from Generations past
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:54,047	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	If it's something I've inherited from my foremothers
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How do you say no that's rude or that's not
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:13:59,423	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Bellator

EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:09,663	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Friend with someone who you're interested in if you say no are they going to just give up and walk away
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:16,575	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And then you're going okay should I just go along with it so I don't lose that he could have been a great guy
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Heart rate of a guy right balance that out but I think that is where the
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,071	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But if you been just walks away
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Another friend of ours I mean it's subtle because you know on the one hand you're having attention I mean
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:39,359	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was brought up as a female to
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,967	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To want male attention you know that that was
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,551	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	A status symbol actually you know if you are
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Attractive enough woman that you could
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:58,303	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Get attention from man that was considered an important thing that was how you were maybe going to end up finding a husband and
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:04,703	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Having children and doing that really conventional stuff so those ideas they don't defy come
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:09,567	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm up all of a sudden you know you're you're surrounded by that grow your whole upbringing
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When was the first time that you've had an experience where you felt like you were allowed to
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Change gears
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,319	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:25,183	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In my late 40s and he stopped
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:28,511	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And asked are you sure this is what you want
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:34,911	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I had never ever ever been asked that before and I was like shocked I didn't
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:39,263	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Speechless in responding to him because I never had been asked that before
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,431	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	At this point in my life I felt
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Strongly that I was different for my foremothers My Generation would be different
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I talk to people my age
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:57,695	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I hear the same attitudes same feelings
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:04,863	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He kept telling me that the reasons I was saying no we're stupid that was drunk and crying
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:10,751	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	A drunk crying girl generally wants to be consoled to some extent but not with sex
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:17,919	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I told him he couldn't f****** and then his dick wasn't me you know and then I was like oh my God for having sex
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I thought we talked about this
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,783	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And even then the whole night was nice
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:26,111	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That part was just sucked a how
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:32,511	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Do I give him what he wants in a way that's not terrible for me but
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Nike deal with
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:40,191	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's like your gut instinct will tell you what no I don't want that since they know and cute way and then say no to 4
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:43,775	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And then there was a point where you just like
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's like I literally just gave up
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Let's just let him have this now because I fought enough and like I don't want to make a scene I don't want to wake up anyone and like
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:59,903	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My roommate sleeping and she's going to get me like I slept on the couch and like it was like his mental gymnastics that
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:06,303	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You do to not tell yourself that you're not putting your needs first but that like all these people up matter
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So much
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,935	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Talk to my 20 year old cousin
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,007	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She's almost a decade younger than me
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like my first boyfriend
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I just wanted to please because I didn't know what I was doing
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,967	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was just going for it and trying stuff and leave
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not asking questions
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I've been getting it so I want that person to like me
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,719	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I want this to be fun for that person
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:38,303	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not thinking about yourself and just be like I'm trying stuff
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:45,471	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Makes me think of something that my best friend Laura said I was talking about being a people-pleaser
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I like how
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:53,919	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And you said that that's habitats how women survive I think women survived by
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:57,247	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Being aware and reading social cues and
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:04,159	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We know when someone's going to be angry we know when someone might lash out we know when someone's
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:07,487	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The Frayed we know when somebody is sad we know when some of these
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,535	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Happy ending and
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,887	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We know when when we're safe and we know when we're not safe and
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You know there's the element of using sex as a social currency to stay safe and
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:23,103	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Using sex as a social currency to
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Belong in
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The group even if the group is just you and one other person
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:38,975	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Start to wonder if this is how anyone who has historically been on the Shady Side of the power dynamic
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Learn how to move through the world
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How important it can be
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To be liked
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:48,191	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Someone who has your fate in their hands
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:58,687	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Sometime after the Jay night I discovered something
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,247	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He brought me answers
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It sounds Hotel
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,927	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Llama sound like
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,487	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It was a recording
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,535	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not a re-enactment
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	An actual recording
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:19,679	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I made this recording two years before the day night
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When I was 25
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,591	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In this recording I'm sitting in a windowless bedroom with a guy named Raul
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm doing an interview about intuition for the show
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Well the times for me intuition just means getting your mind out of the way and being observant
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,671	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	This guy Raul and I dated for a while
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:45,791	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I smiled at him in a coffee shop and he ran down the street after me asking if he could take me out sometime
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was Charmed by him
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But after a few weeks he totally ghosted me
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:55,775	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	By the time of this recording it's been months since we last spoken
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I did that dumb thing where I needed an interview for the show and I was like oh my God
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To be perfect
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Here we are
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,831	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When the interview ends
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I leave the tape rolling because just good radio practice
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:16,255	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Often the most intimate parts of the interview happen after it's officially over
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,071	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So we're just sitting on his bed
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:25,215	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	They don't want to have sex with him or anything along those lines
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:27,007	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That were flirting a little bit
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I'm enjoying it

EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,104	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But you have to be very like
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,384	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Aware
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,224	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Use your intuition
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:45,088	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But even if it seems like I want you to you have to be nice and good
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Okay
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Massage to me is as intimate as a handshake
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But I know that's not the case for everyone
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:56,096	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I start to try to vocalize my boundaries and make sure that what's going on is cool for everyone here
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Can you to feel like you can do it like you can touch a woman without like
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,920	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Having
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like feeling like you need to
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Soccer
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,696	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I don't know I mean like so for example
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:28,608	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	For example right now the way that you're touching me makes me feel like
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:33,728	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Later I'm going to have to tell you that I don't have sex with you
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Tiananmen
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I just wonder like
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:40,896	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	If it's possible
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:47,040	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Is it possible for men to feel like
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:50,368	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Cotuit to genuinely enjoy like
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,800	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But but do you get off on my trying to change someone's mind
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Girlfriend
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	This is the sound of me and Raul having sex
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:42,080	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When I listen to this recording I hear myself say no again
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:45,920	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Presumably when he tries to escalate to full on penetration
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Show camera
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,824	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I feel a little bit like
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Are you
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean I feel good but
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,392	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	S7 want to
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:32,512	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Are we just retarded when it comes to
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,280	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	What we want
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How do we know what we want
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	What part of you knows that you want cuz he was taking analytical mind that knows that you want
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:44,544	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	No how could it be
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,664	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean it doesn't make any sense is analogical
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We can only
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Trigasm
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	After the post-coital cigarette
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I didn't stay over
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Which is really unlike me
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I walked home through a gray Bushwick Warehouse land
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Angry
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,288	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Raul for ignoring everything I said
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,360	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	At myself for totally folding when he push my line
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And at my body
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	For betraying me
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	For enjoying the sex
EDL	00:25:26,528	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I got to go to the interview part of the recording we did produce the intuition show
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Unless it's recording silent in the archives
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	4 years
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,536	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Until one shitty night just like it
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I've been to me on the 4th of July
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:40,864	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	With an old friend
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,144	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Jay
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In the months after the Jay night I dug up this recording
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,056	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I listened closely to myself
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,152	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I listen to the way that I actually sound
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,688	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In A Night Like This
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My boundaries are crossed
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My best friend Laura listen to this
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:05,440	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She said it definitely sounded like I wanted to f*** this guy
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:12,864	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	If you take away the words and just listen to the sounds
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:19,264	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	This is probably exactly the way that I found it
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When I was with j
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:23,616	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Say no in the sweet seductive tone
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm trying so hard to be nice and not hurt anybody's feelings that
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,272	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I know basically sounds like f******
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,112	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:40,768	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I wonder how many people sound just like this when they are getting hot and heavy with someone and they're trying to draw a line
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:45,120	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Express what they want in a way that doesn't break the flirtatious vibe
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,704	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But doesn't negate the possibility of doing other things
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,800	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I wonder how many people sound just like this when they're scared
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:58,432	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I think this is why the definition of consent has evolved
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:02,272	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To me more than no means no or even Yes means yes
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Consent is about knowing that someone is excited about what's going on
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:10,720	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's about knowing that both people are on the same page
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And it's knowing that knowing that is really complicated
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not just because communication is hard and sex that is awful
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But also because there are invisible social and historical context that play in these intimate moments
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Contacts that
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,616	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Impact
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,664	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How entitled we feel to our own comfort
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:33,248	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How likely we are to put someone else's needs first
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	These contacts could be historical like race or class or gender
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,952	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Or they could be super situational
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:48,352	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like when one person is a little bit in love with you and you are in love with them and you can totally sense that they'll do what
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Whatever you want
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:52,448	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When things are uneven in this way
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's important to take extra care
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:57,824	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To create an emotional environment that allows for a no
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I didn't feel like I had that space and either of these encounters
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:07,808	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But on the other hand I should have been stronger and advocating for myself
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:12,672	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm bummed because I thought I was over this s***
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:16,000	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But it seems like I'm going to be struggling with this
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,024	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My entire life
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,096	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And after all this contemplating
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The anger that I have it myself
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Slowly
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,216	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Dissipates
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,056	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I start getting angry at J
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,640	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was not angry at rule because we weren't that close
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:35,712	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Vagina work clothes
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I expected so much more from him
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:42,368	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Expected him to care more about the way I felt
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In the same way that I had cared about the way he felt
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I knew that the strong thing to do
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Would be to talk all this out with him
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	2 days after the night
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,496	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	PG chatted me
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,568	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I ended up sleeping all day
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:11,040	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And then two days later
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,672	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	A month later on my birthday
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,440	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Happy birthday
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Thanks darling
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How are you babe
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Two weeks after that
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,752	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	5 days later
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,312	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Same day
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:36,128	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	What's up
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,456	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Thank God you answered I was getting worried you were active
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:39,968	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Totally ignoring me
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:41,248	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How are you
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:46,624	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I say home every time I friends get together and I know he'll be there
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,696	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I tried to tell her friends what happened
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:53,280	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But when I say it out loud it does sound like almost nothing
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,632	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm a surface we had which day would later call
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Drunken night of masturbation failure
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:00,960	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	No big deal
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:03,520	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Problem is that
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We don't have a vocabulary around emotion that would let me describe with any sense of legitimacy
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:11,712	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The totally invisible things that happened between us that night
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:26,048	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Can we come back from break
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:32,192	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Going to hear from the other side of the aisle from guy's point of views DJ

EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:52,320	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That all my clothes women friends had a story about pushing and knowing that they pushed too far
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:59,232	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And that's actually what you hear in episode 3 of the series called answers were going to play you some excerpts of that now starting a few
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:31:59,744	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Few minutes into it

EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:44,544	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Beer and making the move like that was like the magic answer they learn from older boys
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Men's magazines that getting girls drunk is crucial to the goal of getting girls to do sex stuff
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:57,344	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Cheating in a construction site after 3 beers
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:03,744	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Why does hand underneath the lip of Genesis pants she sits up straight
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:10,144	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So I'll try a little more take as hand away he puts it back
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:16,544	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That's what you're supposed to do right takes it away he puts it back
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	15 year old boy leans back in his chair
EDL	00:33:22,944	00:33:29,344	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Cutting his knees rest on the back of the chair in front of him leaning up against whatever girls but is in the seat
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:35,744	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Sitting behind the girl who I was attracted to you that I would spend a lot of time reading back in This Not That unnatural but not
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:42,144	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That natural leader position and not at guys
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:44,192	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Change it
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	A 26 year-old boy invites his good friend over to his house late at night
EDL	00:33:49,824	00:33:53,664	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And playfully ignores her when she says she doesn't want to do anything below the belt
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:58,272	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When she asks him to jerk off in the bathroom he laughs
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:34:00,832	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And they resolved to jerk off beside each other instead
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:08,000	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	After that night I don't talk to or cj4 years
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,072	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In that time
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:13,120	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I searched for answers elsewhere
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:20,544	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Become obsessed with the topic of consent okay so the idea about the episode is that
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:23,616	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I want to hear about a time where I like someone said no and you pushed
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:24,640	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It became
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:31,040	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Clear you both wanted to consent inherent to you like when you were young or did you have to like
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,088	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Unlearn things that you
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,368	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Women that I know
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:41,024	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Almost every woman in queer I know has a story about being pressured or coerced into sex by a dude
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Let me wonder
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,632	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Does that mean that
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:47,680	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Every man I know has a story
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:49,984	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	About pressuring or coercing someone into sex
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:54,848	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I start out by talking to the men in my life that I trust the most
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,920	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Shall we go to remain nameless or what
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:35:00,992	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Well it's hard cuz you're my dad do you know what I mean
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:05,344	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's fine whatever okay so tell me the story
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:10,464	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Long story was I had a real crush on this girl
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She got
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,512	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Pretty drunk
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So I went down and
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,584	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Snuggle.
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:20,704	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I was rubbing her sides and then we kissed a little bit but that was the extent of it
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:26,336	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You know nothing to too serious by today's standards but by then that was a big deal
EDL	00:35:26,336	00:35:26,848	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:28,896	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	At that time
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:31,456	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	What was the big deal
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Leonardo's
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:33,504	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yas and enjoying that plus she was ferret wearing h

EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It was not it was not usual self
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:51,936	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When did you know that she was upset about it
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The day after we heard through the grapevine we didn't have
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:02,688	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Texting your Facebook fan but you heard pretty quick Through the Grapevine yeah that it
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:05,504	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He was very unhappy about what it happened
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,784	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And felt
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,856	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I've used or taken advantage of
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:17,024	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My relationship was never the same after that I went and apologized but that was there is no
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:24,704	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Coming back from that and so I felt regretful and paid for it because we were no longer friends after that
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,032	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	This is a best friend of mine
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:32,384	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	As soon as I knew that sex wasn't an option I became a bit of a dick
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,432	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:37,504	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Got kind of cold
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And like
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not really communicative
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:44,416	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Or
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah I just became like a stereotypical

EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:51,584	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I became like grumpy

EDL	00:37:48,416	00:37:49,952	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Definitely putting down
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The collective foot
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,816	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Saying that no I shouldn't sleep with her tonight that she was too drunk
EDL	00:37:55,840	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She's like I want you to come over
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:01,216	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Went over to her place and

EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:07,872	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She could feel that I was
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:09,664	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like moving in
EDL	00:38:10,432	00:38:11,968	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She kind of like

EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,024	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I felt kind of confused
EDL	00:38:25,536	00:38:26,816	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Because that night like
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:31,168	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You know we are out and she invited me over to her house
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:37,056	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And for me that's like a message that she wants to hookup that like she wants something to happen
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:42,944	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Otherwise like why invite the person you've been making out with all night over to your place at like
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	4 in the morning
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,016	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	LSi
EDL	00:38:46,016	00:38:47,296	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You're looking
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:47,808	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I like
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:50,112	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Fool around a bit more
EDL	00:38:51,136	00:38:51,904	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,720	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So like I remember
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Getting off of her
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:01,632	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Just lying there for a bit feeling kind of disappointed
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Then like started making out again
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Going around again in the sky like the same process it happened and
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:12,128	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like after doing that for I don't know maybe 20 minutes like
EDL	00:39:12,896	00:39:14,944	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I like got back on top and
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Was kind of making the same moves and
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,064	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	She didn't say no
EDL	00:39:20,832	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It wasn't that point of interjection where she like said no before
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:26,720	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And like
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:30,048	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So I just went for it cuz I was like
EDL	00:39:30,048	00:39:33,120	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Stupid in young and I feel like it's wrong now you know
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like I feel like
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:38,752	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Chad said no before and like I should just been really vocal
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:44,128	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	About like communicating boundaries and like seeing what she wanted for the night you know
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:50,528	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But do you think that there was a moment where you stop thinking about what she wanted and was focusing mostly on what you wanted
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,600	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah I mean I feel like probably the entire encounter
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was thinking what I wanted as opposed to what she wanted
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:01,280	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean I thought that it would she wanted was the same thing as what I want in
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:06,144	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You know what it wasn't that way I felt like
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,936	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I was trying to make it that way
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:12,288	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In this episode Caitlin goes on to
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:14,336	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Speak to a whole collection of other guys who
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:19,968	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	All describe different flavors of the same experience of gently pushing
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:21,504	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Sometimes not so gently
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:22,272	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Pass that
EDL	00:40:22,784	00:40:23,552	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Personnel
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:29,952	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We're going to skip over some of that and engine for a few minutes because eventually Caitlin does end up
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,512	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Convincing Jay to speak with her on tape
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,328	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You want to start
EDL	00:40:36,608	00:40:37,376	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Me
EDL	00:40:37,376	00:40:37,888	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah I mean what were you thinking
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:44,288	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But you should start yeah that's what I was thinking too
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:49,664	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But when you gave me the option I was like was there an alternative I mean I would love an alternative
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:52,992	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not starting would be the alternative
EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:54,784	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	This is Jay
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,320	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The real one
EDL	00:40:56,832	00:40:58,880	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	No reenactment snow actors
EDL	00:41:00,416	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's been three years since we had that shity hook up that inspired this entire series
EDL	00:41:06,048	00:41:08,608	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I knew that after interviewing all of these men
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He was the one I really needed to talk to
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,752	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I procrastinated calling him for months
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:18,592	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He definitely knows that I was upset
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,944	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But I don't think he knows exactly why
EDL	00:41:24,224	00:41:25,504	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Olympics interview
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:26,528	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I have to tell him why
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:32,928	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm afraid I'm afraid of the same thing I was afraid of that night
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:35,488	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Afraid of silencing myself
EDL	00:41:35,488	00:41:37,792	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To avoid uncomfortable moment
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm afraid that he's going to convince me that my feelings are illegitimate and I'm afraid that you'll be a jerk
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:48,800	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Over the years Jay has become kind of a monster in my head
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:55,711	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Stereotype has morphed into a combination of every man I've ever felt sexually coerced by
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:42:02,111	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Become the poster boy
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:06,975	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I think they're feminists because it took some courses in college and really love women
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Friend Jay is gone
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:13,119	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Even know who that person is anymore
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,191	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But a part of my heart opens
EDL	00:42:17,471	00:42:19,263	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He says yes to doing this interview
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,591	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I can tell that he doesn't really want to do it
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:26,175	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I can tell that he's doing it because he wants to help me out
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:29,759	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He could sense how much I really wanted him to say yes
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	So
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:35,135	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	What if I don't know why don't you
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:41,535	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean should we do the hard part first or the easy part first
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:43,583	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Nervous about talking about
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:46,143	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like me and you and stuff you know
EDL	00:42:46,143	00:42:51,775	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I know why do you have to make that face is that face cuz you feel like it's stupid or is that face like
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:56,895	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	No it's not stupid it's of course it's valid it's like it's legit
EDL	00:42:56,895	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But I just
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:01,503	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Doesn't it feel like such a small
EDL	00:43:03,807	00:43:09,951	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But see that I think that that's the thing is that it feels so much bigger to me than it does to you I think
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:14,815	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I really knew you were going to say that isn't what you want
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:21,727	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I just saw it coming
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I also just don't feel like
EDL	00:43:24,287	00:43:28,895	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Me just rehashing every it's just so much work
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:29,407	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Can't we just
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:36,063	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Can we just move on like really is it really that big a deal like honestly I mean
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:41,951	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The thing is it's not in your daily life like can this really follow you around
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:42,975	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:49,631	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	There's like the honest answer to that question and then there is the answer to that question which is like
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:53,215	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Me really wanting to not make you feel bad do you know what I mean
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,263	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	To my thinking it's just like
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In all of our friendship
EDL	00:43:57,311	00:43:59,103	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Knowing what you know about me
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:02,687	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Don't I get a pass
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:07,039	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	For one infraction of this line
EDL	00:44:07,807	00:44:08,831	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I just
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:12,927	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Stupid I just wasn't shrunken school like
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:14,719	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Lake pushed over
EDL	00:44:14,719	00:44:21,119	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	All syringes made such a big mistake and I get that it was a big mistake but it was a mistake and it was like wow
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:21,887	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Wantonly
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:22,399	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	You know
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:27,519	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Would it be so bad I'm not asking you to get over it
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:30,079	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But just like in the abstract
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:33,919	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	If you think about other like another friendship not hours
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:38,015	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Would it be so bad to just get over that one thing you know
EDL	00:44:38,783	00:44:41,599	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like doesn't really warrant becoming
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:43,903	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Baggage for so many years
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:49,279	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah that could also just be me since I'm the one who f***** up
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:53,887	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But I also think you f****** overreacted so you know
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I don't know I mean
EDL	00:44:56,191	00:45:00,799	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And you're also like haven't talked to me for years until now you need something right
EDL	00:45:01,311	00:45:03,615	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	My giggling tells me that I'm nervous
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:08,735	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But I know that in this moment I'm also relieved that we're getting right into it
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,063	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Looking him in the eye for the computer
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:13,855	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Singing to his bedroom
EDL	00:45:13,855	00:45:16,671	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Watching angle the camera so that the lights flattering
EDL	00:45:17,695	00:45:19,743	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The Dubrow monster melts away
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,815	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm just chilling with my friend Jay
EDL	00:45:23,327	00:45:24,863	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	About to have
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:26,911	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Pretty intimate conversation
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,471	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Can a nice
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:31,263	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Not
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:32,543	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Scared of him anymore
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:37,151	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm scared of is that I won't have the courage to say what I need to say
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:39,711	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Start
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,551	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah that's true that's true
EDL	00:45:44,575	00:45:50,975	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Farpoint but I have to say that like I didn't remember you ever saying sorry or like acknowledging my feelings about
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:54,815	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Or even just saying sorry like I just didn't remember you saying sorry like I felt like
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:58,143	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I really trusted you as a friend
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:45:59,423	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And that like
EDL	00:45:59,935	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I said I don't really want to touch Jon's and then you kept trying to
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,311	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Junk touching
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I'm putting my hand on your junk and stuff like that you know what I mean and telling me to touch your junk and like
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:13,247	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I kept trying to sort of like push
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,855	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	At this point I talked for about 10 minutes straight
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:20,415	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I tell him all of it
EDL	00:46:21,183	00:46:22,719	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	He just listens
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,743	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	When sitting here and there
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:28,351	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And tell him what he did how it made me feel
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I tell him about Trevor Smalls and a b****** in the basement
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:37,567	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I tell him that he said and did things that I brought me back there
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:43,711	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I tell him he made me feel like a means to an end
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:51,135	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:46:52,927	00:46:57,023	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I don't I guess that I don't know what else to say
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:47:00,095	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It would have been nice to have had this conversation then right
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,375	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	After
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,423	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It happened because
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:05,727	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Like you said to its
EDL	00:47:06,495	00:47:07,519	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Sleep timer
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:08,543	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Reject offer
EDL	00:47:08,543	00:47:09,311	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	In front of each other
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:13,919	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I was like yeah I was like a super pushy drunk
EDL	00:47:14,431	00:47:15,711	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Hookup guy
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,527	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But that's all I want I wasn't
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:20,063	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Basement
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:26,975	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Guy I know but I understand
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:30,303	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I heard everything you said
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:31,839	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That you just said
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:33,119	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I heard it all
EDL	00:47:33,119	00:47:37,727	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I guess it was frustrating it is like the fact that there is
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,007	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Trauma
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:41,823	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	The den compound
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:44,895	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	That's like a fact but it'll be
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,175	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Nice to know
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:48,735	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Which specific ones
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:51,039	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	We're getting added to it to me
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:54,879	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Cuz like I know I pushed you back there
EDL	00:47:54,879	00:47:57,183	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But then those things that you experience
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:01,279	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And not what happened this is Sarah like I don't ya
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:02,815	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I mean I think that like it's
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:04,863	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It's whether it's not even much of a difference
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:10,751	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But that's the thing I guess it did feel like
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Write me off
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:18,687	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Where do I get to do you know what that's not me like I'm not all those other
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:25,087	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	People I'm sorry that this had that like we got drunk together and that I tried to do hand stuff and you didn't want to
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:27,903	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And then it ended up with us doing heads up next one another
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:31,999	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I'm sorry that still drunkenly I was a dick
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:38,143	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	And I'm sorry that drunkenly I said a bad thing and you know I'm sorry of for all that but it's like
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:42,239	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	How bad do I have to feel
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:49,919	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	One thing is like parsing out where I end and like all the other terrible dudes in the world begin

EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:50,079	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Family I realize that I never got a chance to ask what is inner monologue was that night
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:54,943	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Or what larger personal and social context might have been a play
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:56,735	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	But
EDL	00:49:57,759	00:49:58,527	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	I wasn't silent

EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:21,055	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Of being a free about isolating specific sexual activity
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:27,455	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Worse than that one friend of mine says that they're upset that my first reaction is to be like oh my god what the f*** did I do I'm so sore
EDL	00:50:27,455	00:50:33,855	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	Sorry X suddenly to you I was just like a means to an end
EDL	00:50:33,855	00:50:40,255	| radiolab_podast18intheno1 |	It still makes me angry that I had to fight so hard for legitimacy of my feelings
