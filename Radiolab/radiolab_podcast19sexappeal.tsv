EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,168	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Basic dilemma that's
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:15,520	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At the heart of the story here and I'm going to put it to you as a question bring it
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:17,056	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If you were to
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:20,640	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Do a Ctrl F in the Constitution like how many times do you think the words
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:22,944	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,344	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Sex
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:35,744	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What is one one time in the 19th
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Amendment which
EDL	00:01:36,768	00:01:38,560	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Grants people the right to vote
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	FaceTime
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Really
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:45,472	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yes that's the only time that's the only time which is crazy cuz we are looking.
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:49,056	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is there a sex where that's not sex like gender or something something
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:49,824	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Nothing
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:55,968	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is there like ladies in the condition of women no women have a problem
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,528	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What does that basically we're not in the
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,600	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Except like in this one little spot
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,952	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So when it comes to discriminating against women some people have argued that
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There's nothing in the Constitution
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:11,072	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That says you can't do it
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Certainly in the constitution does not require sexual discrimination
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Discrimination on the basis
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:16,960	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Sex
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:21,568	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Constitution doesn't require it it simply doesn't forbid it
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,872	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Fatboy Justice Antonin Scalia
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,176	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It doesn't mean nobody ever voted for that
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:32,064	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Where did you get it from there was nothing it said that I mean not not those words
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Possibly but there's nothing that says you can't discriminate
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Not on the basis of sex
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That's legal editor Cristian farias
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,816	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We had a 14th amendment that told people that we are
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Equal under the law that everyone is equal protection of the laws
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:49,984	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	14th Amendment
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:56,896	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Identify the 15th that's Martha Griffis congresswoman when you think about the history of the Fourteenth Amendment
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:03,296	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As legal editor Linda Hershman says the 14th amendment was passed in the aftermath of the Civil War
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,088	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Along with the 13th and 15
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	13th Amendment abolishing slavery and 15th amendment giving black people
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,488	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Free black men the right to vote
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If you understand the 14th Amendment to be
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:19,424	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A part of that Trio of amendments okay it was meant to
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bring equality to black people
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,056	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	When the Fifteenth Amendment have been written which that every citizen could vote
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In the name of Heavens why couldn't women vote
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Why don't you why don't you have to have the 19th Amendment
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,552	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Of course the answer why is he didn't consider women people
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,464	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There was this basic assumption in the law
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That you know
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Equality for black people is one thing but men and women
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They're different
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It was
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:58,336	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The case that the Supreme Court had never once met a distinction between men and women in it
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:04,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I didn't like Wendy Williams law professor emeritus at Georgetown
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ridiculous distinction
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:12,416	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The case called Bradwell and it was 1873 or 4
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In that case a woman wanted to become
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A lawyer
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:23,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Illinois Bar said and the justices said that that that was a perfectly good rule because
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The justice system
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,799	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Could be seen as not appropriate for women
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Now let's jump clear into the next Century here 1948
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Okay it was called gessert versus
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Cleary that went to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And the issue was
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Weather women could be bartender
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The court thought that was
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Pretty humorous
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That it made sense
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,279	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That women could not be bartenders
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Unless their husbands or fathers
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We're in charge of the bar both of those laws
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:05,151	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Women are not supposed to be at the bar at either bar
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Attitudes almost 80 years apart
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Women belonged in the private
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Fear
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That was not only the place it was built into their
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bodies
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And that was the assumption
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bro bong
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,535	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Long time
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But just about
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,911	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	67
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There a lot of women in this country who feel it there
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Being pushed around
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:37,663	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Things things had started to
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Come to a boil
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Sex and race
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:50,207	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because they are easy visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into Superior and in
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Interior group
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:57,631	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So in the late sixties and early seventies people like Gloria Steinem
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:04,031	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	No rules other than those chosen from the diseases of racism
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,615	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Stop sexism up to get some traction
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,895	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Saying okay
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's time to put us in the Constitution hurry up and historians say it's a constitutional convention for women
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:19,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I move the adoption of the following resolution
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For something called the Equal Rights Amendment
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What are your hopes what do you think of it will be ratified the stratified early next year
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A1975 it will be ratified
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But it's
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Didn't get the boats in 1975
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,855	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	1976 will be the year
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Or in 1976
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	4 in 1977 and the movement is stalled
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,911	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Why what
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What stalled
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A lot
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:10,847	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But much of the credit goes to this woman
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,431	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Come out in Illinois
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Sloppily my husband Fred for letting me come today
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I love to say that because it irritates the women's libbers more than anything that I said
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She was a lawyer and a
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Self-described housewife
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,791	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Who started a movement
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Cold stop
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yaris
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The whole thing is misrepresented as a woman's rights amendment in fact the principal beneficiary will be mad
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Give man a great opportunity
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How to get out from under their obligation
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Her position was that the Equal Rights Amendment would actually strip women
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:49,759	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The special privilege that they have that comes from being a woman
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:55,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Why not I think though the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman and the wife has a great day
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,695	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Mini rights
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For example she has the legal right
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To be supported by her husband
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And she said
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,863	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If this amendment passes
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,423	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It will be certain unintended consequences
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Amendment says you cannot discriminate on account of facts and if you wanted to know
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:20,735	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Marriage license to a man and a man or deny homosexual the right to teach in the school
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It is on account of facts that you would deny it and that would be unconstitutional under era
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And that argument
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Caught on
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They are things that could happen from the passage of an era time in
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:45,055	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	None of us would like to see happen generation after generation 2 tier
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:49,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I think that there would be homosexual to expect preferential treatment
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:55,807	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He said that it would endanger you got to hear what I have to say cuz you know what's going to happen if
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There will be women and all of my bathroom stall
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:14,751	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Capacity RAV4
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,615	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Had the Equal Rights Amendment passed
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:24,735	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Legal editor Lynn Hershman against it would have looked a lot like the racial Civil Rights Movement
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:28,575	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,623	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It fell three
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	States
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:31,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Short
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,791	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To get a constitutional amendment passed without any 3/4 of State legislatures
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How to say they wanted
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That is
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	38 out of 50
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They only ever got 35
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Dude
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So the question is
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,799	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If you want to get equal rights
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For women
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Written into the law
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,639	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What do you do
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,687	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There's no era
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,015	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The women's lib movement sparked a backlash
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,807	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Do you do
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,695	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Enter stage left
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:14,655	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The notorious RBG
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth Bader Ginsburg RBG can do 20 push-ups and not the so-called girl kind snap before
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:27,455	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Or she was a Supreme Court Justice or a workout sensation before all that
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth Ginsburg
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She was
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,575	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At the ACLU this was in the 70
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And one of the characteristics of Ruth Ginsburg which exists to this day
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,255	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You can hear this
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:44,863	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's the first time she argued in front of the Supreme Court in 1973
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	When you ask her a question there would be
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,471	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Silent
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:54,847	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Enough silence
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To make a person nervous and start trying to help her answer the question
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Kuwait
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We can imagine
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It was in one of those long top
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At Ruth Bader Ginsburg
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Rescued from the key principles behind the era
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,607	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Repackage them
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:22,751	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And March them in through a side door sex like race
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,823	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is a visible characteristics
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:29,151	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bearing no necessary relationship to ability
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:36,063	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Send library has been the major bases for unjustified for at least
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:54,495	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's like what what exactly did RBG do so let me walk you through an app
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,287	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,127	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The era fight is underway
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And RBG and her colleagues are watching
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Right and they're getting worried
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,271	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What if the array doesn't pass
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,063	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What are we going to do if that's the
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,343	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The case how are we going to get
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Equal rights for women
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So they decided
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,415	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Okay
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As an alternate approach let's go back to the 14th Amendment
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The 14th amendments
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Immediate object
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,583	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What's to provide nasty
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Protection
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For the newly freed slaves
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know which
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As we said was designed from the beginning to be only about race
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Suggest broader object
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,151	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The states were prevented from depriving any person
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,687	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Equal protection
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Of the ball
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,271	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It says the word person
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So that
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,111	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Should include women
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:46,719	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If they could just get the courts to see it that way then by default almost
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,767	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We would have a sort of era
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And accordingly
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The task
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,935	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was showing that the racially inflected
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,983	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	14th Amendment apply to
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	2 secs the what about the law is she trying to change what what does she want the court
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She say she wants the court to say
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,223	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That sex would be treated just like race
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,527	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And here's why that's so important
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And the court sees racial discrimination happening
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:17,439	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Under the Fourteenth Amendment it takes a really hard line
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,231	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Looks at it really really closely
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,023	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At least it's supposed to
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,095	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Whereas other kinds of discrimination
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:24,863	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Not so much
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:29,471	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is actually some discrimination is necessary
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It has to
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It discriminates between 18 year old and 17 year old
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:37,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Between criminal and non-criminal otherwise
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:41,503	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But the courts decided that race is going to be a big red flag
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,575	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They're going to ask governments legislators presidents
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:49,439	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To have a compelling reason a compelling State interest to do race discrimination
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Otherwise
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,487	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's going to be unconstitutional
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	With me so far
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,303	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yes
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To discriminate based on race you need to pass it release
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Super hard test
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	By the way the legal name for this test
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:01,983	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Strict
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Scrutiny
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Call the lake
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,127	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We mean business there's only like
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:10,175	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But anyway the point was
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,967	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But like they took it seriously
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,551	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Which you know back in the day they weren't doing with sex
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Discrimination at all
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because when legislators would come up with these Lots like this women can't be bartenders law
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,743	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Supreme Court would be like
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I probably have a good reason for that
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,887	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Listen to review reason it can just be a reason
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,447	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Doesn't have to be very good this up to be good
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,543	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We could even maybe even make it up on the fly it just has to be a reason
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For upholding this law like in the case of the bartenders law
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bars are dangerous
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,735	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Women need more protection in cordless be like okay
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:48,831	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So RBG needed a way to convince the court
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To be as
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,367	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Intense
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	About sex
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Discrimination
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As they were about Reese
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:53,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Discrimination
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,791	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How do you convince an audience of men
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,863	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Were used to discriminate on the base
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Sex
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,423	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Who been doing it for years
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:06,239	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How do you convince them
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That discrimination is a bad
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:14,175	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I think of people who want to keep women down would like nothing better than to women go off in the corner
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,455	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I speak only to win
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,991	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Nothing would happen
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:21,343	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	This is her giving a recent talk about her 1970 strategy
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You need to persuade
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Men
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If this is right for society
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,767	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Part one of her strategy
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Choose your words carefully
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The head of Secretariat Columbia
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:39,007	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Who said I'm typing these things for you and jumping out all over the
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,287	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Pages
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,055	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Texas
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Don't you know
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The audience you are addressing
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:50,015	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The first Association of those men
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,319	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What the word sex
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:58,719	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He's not what you're talking about
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So you use a drama book
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Charm use gender
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,119	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Cuz you know the word sex has a charge to it
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:06,655	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Gender
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Cooler
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I'm parked over strategy
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Choose your
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,799	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Paces carefully
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,103	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	This is all happening in the 70
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,431	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Please when RBG is the head of ACLU women's rights project
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:23,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So she's deciding which kinds of cases the ACLU is going to support
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,855	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As they make their way to an all-male
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:26,367	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,671	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Your strategy was
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If we live in a man's world right now
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,535	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We need to find cases
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:36,607	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But nine men at this moment
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Can handle so for example early on in her tenure at the women's rights project the other
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Lefty lawyers are suggesting that the women's movement needs to take up the cause of us being right
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,687	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And she says
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,711	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Not
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,015	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yes and I think
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,295	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Go slow
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is the right approach
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,879	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She said first
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We need to go after that
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Small
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,743	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Insidious idea
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,559	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At the Supreme Court had been keeping alive for
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	4 years old the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That Phyllis Schlafly idea
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:17,567	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That discrimination is actually good for women gender classifications
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Will always rationalize
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As favors
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Two women
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,455	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And so
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	RBG decided not just to bring cases where women were the victims of discrimination
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,343	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Okay
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,671	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	My name is Curtis Craig she brought cases
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Where men wear the badge
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,767	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Who were you as an 18 year old
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Now that's a great question
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That was like any 18
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You're old
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Young man
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,703	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Invincible
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:49,567	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Get out of thought I was quite the ladies man if you name it I mean
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You made it into Lambda Chi Alpha at Oklahoma State
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was living at the frat house
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Arab
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,527	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A fraternity was
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Primarily made up of wrestlers so was when you went down the hall
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You're about to be taken down at any moment you be thrown into the wall
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You leave a body print
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What do you mean like an indentation literally in the wall or like
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:19,263	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It was it was amazing
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	There was a lot of partying going on
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:31,807	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Lot of beer yard would be filled with beer cans here's the key if they wanted to get all that beer
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,647	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They have to enlist the help
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,415	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Adelaide
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yeah I mean you know the sorority sisters yes you would have a female buy you a beer and you'd go out and

EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,263	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	State at the time
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Philly
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,823	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Girls could buy
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:57,151	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At age 18 but the boys had to wait
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,919	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Until
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	21 was something about the level of maturity I guess for women versus men at that time
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,343	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Principal was that
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:11,743	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Boys got into more car accidents so they should be trusted with blessed beer
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Did that make you angry or absolutely
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,143	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well I was extremely unfair yeah I would say
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:20,959	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It made I think most men angry at the time
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I'm a Supreme Court case
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was born

EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,503	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Case
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,831	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To the RBG RBG gets involved in this computer case
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:42,207	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yes but this is this is a this is a situation where women have rights men don't have
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,999	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Why would she want
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Argue this case

EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Where
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Chris strategy is kind of like
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,751	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A trojan horse
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You look at this case right on the outside
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:58,591	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It looks like
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A case about men being discriminated
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But if you think about it
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,271	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Beneath that discrimination
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is actually this kind of unspoken idea about women so go with me on this right if men
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	AR
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:20,095	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Irresponsible they can't handle beer then women girls are more responsible and well-behaved
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	More delicate they can be trusted
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:25,727	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	With something like beer cuz they want abused it
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know so
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:28,543	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	With that line of thinking
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,847	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's not long before you're
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Trying to put
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Women
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:33,407	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Them from
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know scary places like
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,807	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bars or courtrooms for
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,599	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Political office
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,391	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Using this case
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,975	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	RBG is able to walk into the court
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:50,559	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is discrimination about men but also the discrimination against women that's
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,839	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Attached to it
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In or inside of it

EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Too big they can't get in
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:40,032	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's so Odysseus comes up with this clever plan
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Give the Trojans this giant wooden horse
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,128	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They'll bring it to their City

EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:56,416	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Are soldiers were hidden inside the horse will come out
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:00,768	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And they will take the city
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Now in our case Odysseus is as RBG

EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In order for this
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:10,752	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Very
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Admittedly imperfect we need someone in the horse to come out the warrior in the horse the woman warrior
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:18,688	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,224	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In our case
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,504	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That woman warrior

EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:07,456	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Had no idea what homecoming was but shortly after moving to Stillwater
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They open the doors
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:12,832	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To the honk and holler
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:18,976	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And where we went in was just about three blocks four blocks from the college
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:21,280	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And we went into business there
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:23,328	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A drive-through convenience

EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,368	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Took a lot of in and out and in and out
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:55,072	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	All night long you wear tennis shoes out real fast so he was all sheer energy
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:55,840	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Being gutsy
EDL	00:29:55,840	00:30:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Homecoming night we were supposed to close its 11 the store is flooded with
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,984	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Customers till
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:03,264	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I think
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:08,384	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Two or three in the morning they're like thrilled because they've never run a business by themselves before
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And all these college kids are coming in and buying Coors beer
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:16,064	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Including of course a steady stream of girls buying
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ear presumably for their boyfriend and it is yeah I never did get to see homecoming
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	All I saw was cars coming in and out
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:26,560	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Fast forward a few years
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,096	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	1972
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:30,400	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Back at the University Inn at all
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:35,776	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Had long blonde hair Curtis Craig buddy named Mark Walker
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:38,080	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The time is it a political science class
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And the professor starts talking about the whole fight for the era which is happening right at that moment
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:48,064	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And at this point Oklahoma hasn't ratified the era
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:50,880	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Somehow the conversation turns to
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	MRSA
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:55,744	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Talk about discrimination this beer law
EDL	00:30:55,744	00:31:02,144	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is discrimination against us in the professor challenged him about doing something about the beer laws if he was go
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:02,912	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Going to complain about him
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The one day
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:10,848	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was behind the counter people coming in and out Mark Walker walks into the honk and holler the young man
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Came in to talk to me she doesn't really have time to talk she's running in and out but
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	They stood there
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:22,880	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Waiting patiently I bet he was in there for hours and he was looking at the beer license you looked at the lights
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:25,184	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A nurse is that Caroline's name
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:25,696	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Is the one on it
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:30,816	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because actually my husband lost his license after he sold beer to a young man
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,632	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So he put them in my name
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Anyway at a certain point
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In between all the hunks and hollers he asked me
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,800	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What I thought about the beer laws
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,848	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I told him
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:49,248	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was very vocal about it I always had been she says it doesn't make any sense we send these young men off to war
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:52,832	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We're being drafted at 18 we don't let them drink beer when they come back
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was that jazz
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:32:00,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	At The Mention the liability issues you have these 18 year old girls coming in buying beer slipping into their boyfriends
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,072	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How am I supposed to stop at your you can't prove
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Who buys what
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,168	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So eventually when Mark Walker asked
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For her help he
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Said he was going to do a term paper
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She's like sure why not I was always willing to help them
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:15,616	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because they had help
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Get started
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:20,224	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I still thought it was a term paper
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:23,808	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So was he not being completely honest with you then
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:26,880	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well I didn't hear half of what he said
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,440	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was busy every time he came in
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:30,720	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So you know
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It wasn't that important at the time
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,840	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So I didn't think any more about it
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,632	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He left my husband was gone
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was the out-of-state working
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:45,056	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I know I didn't say anything to him about it it wasn't important
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:48,128	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know I just thought it was a conversation
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But it wasn't just a conversation
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,224	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because before that meeting
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,760	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Mark had gone out
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:54,528	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Looking for a lawyer
EDL	00:32:54,528	00:32:55,552	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That's correct
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And Curtis and Mark and the other frat brothers
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:02,720	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I tried to race the money that was flawed in a campus town
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Her body
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:06,304	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Use their last dollar for that last beer
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But they managed to find his lawyer who would do it
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,376	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I'm a sheep
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Alright well I'm just Fred Gilbert attorney at law
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:14,496	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	No big signal nobigdyl
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Remember I'm always wearing his military boots
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:18,848	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Actually I'm bleeding
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:24,224	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Moorim even to the Supreme Court Fred had worked on another male discrimination case
EDL	00:33:24,224	00:33:24,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In the past
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And this case was pretty straightforward
EDL	00:33:30,368	00:33:36,000	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Most irresponsible and drunken woman in the state could buy it and limited quantities that 18
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,048	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well that was discrimination
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,352	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Become more male rights
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Case
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:42,912	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What was
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:47,776	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And do you remember corresponding with Ruth Ruth Bader Ginsburg
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:50,336	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth Bader Ginsburg
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,360	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Before she was on the court
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:54,176	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Somehow Ruth Bader Ginsburg noticed
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:55,712	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And she watched
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,528	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As Fred made his way up the courts
EDL	00:33:59,040	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Losing at every level
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,112	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And by this point
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth Bader Ginsburg with head of the women's rights project at the ACLU
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:09,280	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She's already argued a few cases before The Supreme Court
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:11,328	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Which had in the courts
EDL	00:34:11,328	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Slowly
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,888	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	For the idea that sex
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was like race
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:16,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And she thought that this case
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:17,728	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was interested
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She gave protocol
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:23,104	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We have a problem in a personal relationship has no question
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:27,712	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was something of an unreconstructed male chauvinist
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:28,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She was not
EDL	00:34:28,736	00:34:31,296	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Fred did not see this as a women's rights
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was just kind of an unnecessary insult a man for no reason
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,952	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Looking at this case
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:39,488	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Got no Fred
EDL	00:34:39,488	00:34:40,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It's more than that
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It didn't matter to her
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:45,888	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	If the plaintiff was a man or a woman because in most of those cases
EDL	00:34:46,400	00:34:49,472	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The discrimination against the man was derivative
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:52,544	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Of a prior and worst discrimination against the woman
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,664	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Here's to the ladies the fair and the weak
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:58,688	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	How do they do
EDL	00:34:59,200	00:35:00,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Where do I find all that energy
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That's seemingly inexhaustible store of Pep and Ginger
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:05,600	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Again
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:10,208	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Bruce was after the stereotype about women that was nestled inside the beer law
EDL	00:35:10,720	00:35:13,792	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That women are more responsible and well-behaved
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But in order for her to make that connection she needed Fred to write his brief in a way that would be useful for
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,776	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So prefer not just to male discrimination
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But discrimination based on gender
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Well
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,432	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I supported her
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,224	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I just never was
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,016	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Shall we say a militant feminist
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,552	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	To like
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:37,088	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth had her work cut out for her
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:39,648	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What you was getting sort of used to dealing with these robes
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:44,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So with other local lawyers that she'd worked with in the past
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,536	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Ruth have been more forceful
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:47,328	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Insisting that she make the argument
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,376	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But that had backfired
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:55,520	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	So she likes like okay you argue it right she was afraid telling him that she didn't need to be the one to present or large
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:56,544	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Before the court
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:58,592	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She was fine if he'd do it
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:02,176	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But she very gently very persistently
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:06,272	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was able to convince him to let her help him with his legal brief
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:07,552	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Betta
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I think it was a
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Couple months later cuz my husband was out-of-state every month
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:17,280	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Meanwhile back at the honk and holler Carolyn has no idea what's going on
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	No
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,584	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	No idea
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,888	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I got a phone call
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:23,936	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	My husband was on the phone
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:27,520	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We'll have salesman in and I had people coming in and out
EDL	00:36:27,520	00:36:28,032	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:30,336	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I right
EDL	00:36:31,104	00:36:32,128	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:33,152	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Furious
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:36,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I couldn't figure out what was going on she was like
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:40,576	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Case are you talking about well he had picked up a newspaper
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:43,392	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In North Carolina and a bank
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:46,720	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And it was on the front page of the newspaper
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	With my name and
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:49,792	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	About us suing
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:55,680	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It look like we sued everybody in the state of Oklahoma that was in office
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	All way down to the
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,008	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Garbage man he's like
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What did you do how are you we don't want to get mixed up in this we don't want her name on this we don't want to make a fuss like this could hurt
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:11,808	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Business like how dare you you know I didn't know what happened I really didn't know and eventually she figured out
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,344	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It must have been that kid came in here
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:16,416	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And now it's like at the Supreme Court
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:22,816	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What I was back and forth on that phone with him trying to wait on customers and I bet that
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I took about three hours and he would not let up I mean he kept calling back and call him back
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:31,008	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He called the lawyer he was mad
EDL	00:37:32,288	00:37:37,664	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And then the last phone call he said I am flying back in and he said you pick me up
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Couple nights later
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Drove to the airport
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,272	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Picked him up
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Anna
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was still mad
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,696	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That was the longest
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:51,232	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Car ride
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:54,560	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	As they drove back
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She says he just
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:37:56,608	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Lectured her
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,888	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The whole ride
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:37:59,168	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I just listened to him
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,192	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What did he say
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:03,776	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I don't know what he said word to word
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Yeah I just know he was strong with what he said
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	With my husband it was best to just be silent
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I was never afraid of him
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:19,904	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,440	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I knew how far to push it
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:28,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Tommy got from the airport to the other side it was about an hour and 20 minutes
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:32,704	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That's a long an hour and 20 minutes in the car where you can't get out
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,520	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:37,824	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Over the course of that hour and 20 minutes
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,384	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	She said something in her
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,176	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Shifted
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:44,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And at a certain point she
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:47,040	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Basically turned to him and was like
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,320	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	No
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:52,160	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Like I know you want me to drop this case
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:56,000	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But I'm going to fight this out he threatened me Every Witch Way
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,768	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I didn't budge
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,560	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Probably
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:00,864	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The reason why I didn't budge
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:03,424	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Because he fought me so hard on it
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,728	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	You know I believed in it
EDL	00:39:06,752	00:39:08,288	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That I had never step
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,104	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Out like that that's the first time I really
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,920	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Put my foot down and didn't budge
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:18,528	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I gave so much to him
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:19,808	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I mean
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I didn't get a salary for 25 years
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,672	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I didn't ask for
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,512	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I figured we were equal
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:31,328	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I figured I work the same hours he did
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I figured I stood
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:35,168	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Deciding
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,960	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Not behind him and not in front of them
EDL	00:39:39,008	00:39:41,056	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	October 5th 1976
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Day of oral arguments
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:48,736	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	The lawyer Fred Gilbert across very many people that I didn't care for him I didn't care for
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:50,528	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	He was so
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Pushy
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:51,808	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Insist
EDL	00:39:52,320	00:39:53,600	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That Caroline needs to come to the

EDL	00:50:02,111	00:50:02,879	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	But even so
EDL	00:50:04,159	00:50:04,927	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	In
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Her own life
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:08,255	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	This case
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:10,559	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Was it beginning
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,935	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	A couple of years after we won that case
EDL	00:50:16,447	00:50:17,727	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I went into China
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:20,287	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Right after it opened up

EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:27,455	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	I did I was so curious
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,271	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And we never went like the tourist went
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:34,879	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We get on a train and if we saw something we wanted to stop and see
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:35,903	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We would stop
EDL	00:50:36,671	00:50:38,207	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	We never had a schedule
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:42,815	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I never did really go to shop I was just
EDL	00:50:42,815	00:50:43,839	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Curious about the people
EDL	00:50:44,351	00:50:45,375	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And how they lived
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:46,911	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That's so so much
EDL	00:50:47,679	00:50:50,495	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I talked to so many people while I was gone
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:52,031	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	That
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:53,823	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	It was like a hunger
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:00,991	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And you grow from it
EDL	00:51:03,295	00:51:05,599	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And I just wanted to see things
EDL	00:51:05,599	00:51:08,415	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And that was just that just open the doors for me
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:07,039	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	What happened to Caroline at the end
EDL	00:52:08,319	00:52:10,367	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	Xi'an Duane divorce in mm

EDL	00:52:25,215	00:52:26,751	| radiolab_podcast19sexappeal |	And invite her to speak
