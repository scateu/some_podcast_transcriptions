EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Where where do we start
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:25,152	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But if you start where we left off right right where we left off we thought we had

EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Animal
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:32,320	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Otherwise in the world champion of rainbows
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	South champion ring listen to Radiolab by the way
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:40,256	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Roberts 07 issues ago we did a show about colors we had a very simple question
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Who
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,096	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Among Us earthlings sees the best rainbow
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	We found a champion
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And we're going to
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Reevaluate
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:55,872	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That Carnation as time passes and science advances so
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,456	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I think we should play the original segment
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Because it is Delight
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Rifle you hear the crowning of the champion and then we should re-evaluate whether the champion deserve to be crowned
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	End of the the early segment it started with Robert ask a question to
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Cognitive Scientist by the name of Mark Shane giese
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But here's a question if a dog
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,888	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And be human
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,424	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And a
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Crow we can be staring at a rainbow would they be seeing very different things
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,312	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yes
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:31,712	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Know this question that Robert is kind of tossed out during an interview
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,248	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How different creature
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	See the rainbow
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,320	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	This ended up taking us down a little wormhole
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	We ended up actually getting a choir
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Dealt with illustrator
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,440	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What we learned
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But just a set of Baseline your normal rainbow goes like this
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Starting bottom up
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Red orange yellow green
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,800	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Blue violet roygbiv
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,568	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Reggie Bell
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yea though I don't know why people put the i in there but that's it we didn't have the Indigo you couldn't say it though. That's why you need the IRS
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That by the way is Tom Cronin
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What's called a visual ecologist Mark suggest
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:13,184	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	McCall he told us that humans see
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Seven colors in the rainbow
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And in the case of the dog
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Very different rainbow it's going to start off
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Blue hillbilly Seafood is fine
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,167	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So it was here rainbow starting with blue
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:26,495	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	St. Louis CNN grading off into green
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Same for us
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,871	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And then disappearing
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,151	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Give me the weather in there
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Video
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That's it
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:37,759	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah so the rainbow the only good. Hafez
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	SRS wow
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Lucky rainbow
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:46,975	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Dog that's why when God promised that he would never deliver another day lose a game
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	If I made the promise in a rainbow
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The dogs 2 strip totally unimpressed
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What is it about the dog I that
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Makes it see this way
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It doesn't have
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,703	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Red sensitive
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Photoreceptors no red sensitive cones
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The weird thing is it the difference between dogs and us
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's just one they have cones tuned to blue and green so do we
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	We have this one extra
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Red
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's just a really seem like a big difference
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's just one call
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But I have three
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's so much better than two that's janeites Vision scientist
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Because of this kind of multiplicative thing
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,095	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Redken get mixed
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	With blue
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Check purple
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Or red can get mixed with yellow
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How to make orange
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,311	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Green mixed with blue teal or turquoise
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,895	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That's how we get about a hundred different shades
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Colors that we can see
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,271	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	2 by adding one photopigment instead of adding just
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	One more color you actually add about 98 colors
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,415	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Let's move on to now we have a
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,463	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Pro unless you'd like to change the bird
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Well the crow is not so much because it's pretty much like us
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:56,607	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Let's take a listen or something like a
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	A sparrow sparrows have ultraviolet vision
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What did they say
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:06,847	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So they see the rainbow starts before I remove starch for wheezing see Sky it would see in ultraviolet
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,359	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What color
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,431	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And then it would see the violet
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That would see the blue
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,551	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And the greens
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Les oranges
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,415	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Is our first in your engine and then the writer probably would see
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Further into the red mask because I have
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:27,583	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Amore red sensitive red receptor than we have
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,959	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	See a much broader rainbow would start earlier and it would end later
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:43,967	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So should we assume that we've now that this Powers the champion but that's the that's that's as high as a guest if you're talking about
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:44,991	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Vertebrates
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:51,903	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	No I'm talking about anything that has a heart and a mind an advantage you leave the vertebrates then all bets are off you've got
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,487	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Many animals have much better color vision than the vertebrate story
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,071	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Like butterflies or butterflies have five or six
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Kinds of
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Of color receptors we only have
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,399	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Tree ring
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,471	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Butterfly see more colors than we do
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:06,239	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So if a butterfly release
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	King of the rainbow
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:18,271	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Butterflies are out there when we see colors we have no names
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:22,879	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	For between the blues and the greens and the greens on the yellow so it would go from
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Ultraviolet would see that then it would see violet

EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Here's the dog
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Givens
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Now the Sparrow
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Lil bit more bass look more high-end
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	To speak finally
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The butterfly
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,559	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Just so you know not so far about this. What's got more meds in there
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So I'm not thinking butterfly butterflies get the crown
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah but
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,215	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Then you go on the coral reefs you come across
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	These animals called mantis shrimp
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,823	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Where they called metal like mantis like a praying mantis
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It was from catches prey using an arm like a praying mantis has
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:25,343	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Shrimps are barn mostly pretty small about the size of a finger some get to be as big as your forearm
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Big big animals
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	My God they're so colorful know they are colorful though
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Your hair look at this
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's like they're Electric
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And I like turquoise
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And their eyes are like a little cartoon eyes
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,263	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Gigantic
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah they have two really big eyes right on the front and you said the dogs have
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Two cones we have
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How much does a butterfly have again
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,223	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Butterflies V
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Depends on the butterfly
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Mantis shrimp have 16
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Teen dies of receptors what would the rainbow look like to them
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:08,607	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They live in very shallow water and so the water is pretty clear almost like
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:13,471	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They would start the rainbow way way way inside where we see Violet they would say
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,799	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Extraordinarily deep
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Ultraviolet
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:23,455	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And then they would go on through as several kinds of ultraviolet that's probably five or six kinds of ultraviolet
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:25,247	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I never get to Violet with
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Not reaching our colors
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And go through Violet and violet
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:32,159	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Blue and blue and blue green
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:35,231	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Will they have those green green blue blue blue as well
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Then they would go out to the Reds
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So they would be about it at that as red as ice when I got to the red end but only in the bed
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:52,895	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What are rainbow that must

EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:55,967	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Chris is about to
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,551	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What's the poor little blue thing that you were about to put in
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,343	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	We're actually going to be a damsel fish

EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Ingested into the mantle
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Stanco Fishers in
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Another fish is sensibly hiding in the back
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:15,679	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Fish is hiding behind the tube at the fish should

EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I don't know 5 minutes trying to find a way out
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The whole time the Mantis was like I see, I'm just chilling in its 2 and then
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Launched out of it to but then
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Well that was just so sudden
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Ice cream
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	You know cuz they have these claws on the front of their body that they used
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Punch their prey and you can literally hear the snap
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	From across the room
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And then he and this is sad he then took a lap and then came back in and just full
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Just punch the fish a few more times
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,855	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Oh wow that's
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,391	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That's
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,415	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's a hard ending for that
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,511	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Fort Collins now
EDL	00:19:12,511	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's one of those like nature moments where you're sort of amazed but you'll see
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I want to cry
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What's up
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's okay. Let's talk about efficient cleaning his eyes now
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:29,151	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	After it killed the Fish Shack went back to his tooth and started kind of like scrubbing his eyeballs with its little
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Russia's important thing
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:37,599	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Houses like did you see what I did to that fish
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	No checking my eyes
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:45,535	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And ask her what those I see our notion of that is totally changed over the last few years so
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That another marine biologist that Amanda talk to
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,887	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Do you mind introducing yourself
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	To me like a my name is
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Professor Rosalind this is what I do for a living
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,823	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How do you want to do that
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,639	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Now is good
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Hello my name is Justin Rose wife
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Marine biologist Anthony are scientist working on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:13,951	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Just for contact he Justin is the guy who basically put the Mantis on the map
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,231	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Kia
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	He was the first guy his lab was the first laptop
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:21,887	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	To notice that they saw color at all
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The University of Sussex
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The 1995-96 apparently he had a
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:32,639	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Colleague from West Africa who's wearing particular dress colorful traditional dress
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	She walks in his lab where he's got all the aquariums and immediately all the matches sugar rush to the beginning of the Korean War like hey
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	She walked in and went wild
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What does that mean they started waving the appendages and
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Shuffle that colors now that I know a little bit about mantis shrimp so I know exactly what they were saying to I reach would be entirely inappropriate
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:55,935	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They were turned on
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Colorful thing what should we do
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So just was a guy that basically proved
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,567	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Okay these animals have color vision
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,127	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Fantasy color he confirm that with this
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Experiment with colored containers you can get them to just
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Bait Living Daylights Outta that thing that's colorful
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Focus I love to smash
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Sonia that was all background here's a new for me
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,440	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Recently
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Justin and his lab decided to ask a new question
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,280	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	He decided to say all right
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:24,096	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	These all these shrimp they have so many rods and cones in their eye
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And by the way he would say they were 12
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,216	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Which is still
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	4 times a week
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How well do they use them
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What that means how well do
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Do they usually have them they must use them for something
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:41,760	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Flexeril like if you're a scientist you can't just ask
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Soon the day
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:46,368	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	See things the way that we see things don't mean you have to make sure
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,184	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So I mean you know you is simple question to start off with
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:51,744	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How well do they see different shades of the same color
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,840	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Kind of thing that we do at the grocery store all the time
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So you know if you got take a banana from her stool
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:00,192	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Even if you pick one that's just going yellow
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Still a little bit green not yellow enough to Yellow you know you use your eyes to make
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Call wunderkinder shrimp
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,176	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Can this animal distinguish
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Between discharge of red and black China
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,016	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Is blue and black
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Can they make this fine distinction
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:16,832	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I assume so
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah because they got all the rods and cones right if they weren't putting them to some extraordinary
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:24,768	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Obvious use would be
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:31,424	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	More blue or more exactly what do you want to be sure
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Mantis shrimp I'm going to give you
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Food from this yellow thing
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,848	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So what did it basically is that you would show the shrimp yellow light give him some food
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Little lights
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,200	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Food yellow light food they quickly learned that yellow means food
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:45,248	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Cool so then he shows the shrimp
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	A blue light where there is no food and naturally the foods with the yellow it's not with the flu
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:52,672	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Mosto
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:53,440	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Most can do this
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:58,816	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But then he would gradually make the blue side to non-food side
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,120	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	A little more yellow Berry graduate
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,912	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	He would shift the color from Blue
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,192	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	32 Bluegreen
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,960	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Green
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:07,520	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Then green yellow just to see if
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The shrimp could tell the difference between yellow which means
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:11,104	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Food
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:13,664	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And yellow Greenwich
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,480	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Doesn't mean food that's what we did and we expect
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Get the mattress room to have
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Tophatter
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,576	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Distinction of that sort of level
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I was surprised
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,928	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	To find that it was the worst animal on the planet so far Chester
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	No
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Now you're exaggerating
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Are champion
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Of the rainbow
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What's the worst creature ever test
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The worst so
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	In other words
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Nature gives them a panoply of choice and then they
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:49,248	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Can't tell the difference that which the point of that there something wrong with this Theory
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Can I say you come to my pants. I'm going to show you 50 shades of purple
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:59,488	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Are you can only see three then what are you doing in there like I don't know what you did they seem to have the equipment to see all the purple
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	All the colors
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	All the Many Many Shades but
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Still they got these amazing ice they just don't seem to use them
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,424	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The way that we do
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I don't understand that
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah okay
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,544	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So this is why you need to stop thinking about
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Coloring
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	What colors are according to just Marshall the basic thing to understand is that you don't actually see color with your eyes I mean you take
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Taking the light with your eyes
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,296	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But then the color is rain in Ukraine
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They have these little insect braids
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,648	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That don't
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,976	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Seemed to do color the way that our brains to the right which way
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:32,000	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	See color is
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	If I see a thing
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,888	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That's a somebody wearing a blue sweater walking down the street
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,168	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Nice-looking
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Lady or gentleman wearing a blue thing at my blue Furniture except in my eye
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Gets really excited
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:48,640	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Tell your brains going to see that blue
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Ugly sweater right now
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	If that blue sweater had a little bit of red in it
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The red
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,320	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Photoreceptor would also buzz but not as loud
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,880	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The ratio of those expectations
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,160	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Gives my brain
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,928	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Sensational
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	All right got a lot of blue a little bit of red what could that be
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Wechat
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That's what you end up seeing like your brain
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,168	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Sarah Paints the gap
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:13,728	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And that's how every animal on the planet Ceres color
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:15,776	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Except for my
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's brain doesn't seem that interested
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	In
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Painting Gap
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So back in their segments when we said it sees a full
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Throated
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	WYD
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,600	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Boise spectrum of color
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Like this
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Static
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:38,304	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Glorious Vision best rainbow view of all creatures on Earth that we said that's what he said
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	More
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:39,840	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	More
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,680	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Variety in the rainbow then we can or than anybody
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That was at
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	That was our thought we might need to amend that
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,544	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	How do you say
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They still see
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,360	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Colors that we don't see
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But they might not just be seen as many colors as
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Maybe there rainbow
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:58,016	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Is more a series of
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Of rather focused
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Discrete bands of color with not allowed in between
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:10,560	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I am very very
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,584	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Extraordinarily puzzle
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They're given the equipment that we used to
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,424	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	To see
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Various
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:23,360	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Shades of color and they don't use it to see shades of color what are they use it to see what they use it to
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I mean this is all speculative but
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,296	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Tom Cronin was telling us in the fish shop that liked
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	The science seems to be heading towards the
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:33,600	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	This idea
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,904	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Did they use colors to communicate
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:42,560	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	If that's the case that you don't need to see all the colors they just need to see the ones that mean something
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:46,144	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	At least in the ultraviolet there's really good evidence that way it's not
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:49,216	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	It's not public so I don't want to talk about too much cuz it's not my work
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But it looks like
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Different parts of the UV have very different meanings like one part might being
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Fear
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Don't go there another lightning
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Sex
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I'd like to get to know more about this
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Maybe another part means home who knows certainly very
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:12,256	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Species to species were talking about the whole Rangers
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	At least 500 species start
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,584	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	You should have blank
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Explanation is a bit simple
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But what you're saying is that
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:22,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Instead of seeing rainbows there
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	There are having a conversation with
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Yeah maybe they just vocabulary
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They have all these rods and cones so they can talk to the world not so they can
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,016	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	See the beauty
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:37,856	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And this is complicated but they have that they can do polarized light
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Oh
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	So hard to
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:46,560	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	But apparently thought that some species can Flash polarized light at each other as a way of communicating
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Somehow I'm not even going to try and explain that cuz I don't get it
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:49,888	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	They are
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,960	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	An unbelievably
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Amazing
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:54,240	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Different cysts
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Any other item on the
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,616	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	You got to ask yourself
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,128	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Question
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:02,688	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And I've been asking myself that question
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Society is
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,992	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	And I guess I'm a
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:06,272	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	Cuz I still have knots
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	You could call me a failed
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,160	| radiolab_podcast18rippinrainbownewer3 |	I don't think we're going to do that
